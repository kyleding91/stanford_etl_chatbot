 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Today's special guest is Erin Levy, who is the co-founder and CEO of Box.net. I got a chance to talk to a few days ago as we prepped for this lecture. And I have to tell you, I think you're going to be wowed. He is inspiring and interesting and very funny. And he's got a great story to tell. So without further ado, Erin. Cool. Thank you. And actually, um. APPLAUSE Slight. Slight coincidence. Our company is actually underwritten by J. Perfisher-Durvenson as well. So, um, this will, this will, thank you, DFJ. Um, can you hear me fine? Is it, are we plugged in and everything? Cool. Very good. And, um, I think, so I'm going to use a PowerPoint to, uh, to go through what I'm talking about. How's everybody doing, by the way? Great. Great. Okay. Very cool. Okay. We're jumping right in. So, um, so I'm Erin Levy, the CEO and co-founder of Box. And we'll talk a little about what Box is. And, um, this is actually a new presentation. So, hopefully it's useful. I've done my best to make it useful, but you sort of get what you pay for. Uh, and I don't know how much you guys pay for the tickets to this thing, but, um, uh, we'll see how it goes. Um, okay. So everybody's good? Yeah. So, you're probably wondering who am I? Why am I qualified to talk to you? What, what am I doing here? What, what can I possibly kind of impart on, on everyone? Well, the first thing is I don't have a college degree. So, um, I, I dropped out of college when we, when we started Box. And so, um, I didn't learn a lot of the stuff in school. Um, I was rejected from 90% of my internships. Um, it turns out it's a bad idea to ask for a promotion before your internship starts. Um, so that didn't work out very well. And I don't have any estranged co-founder suing me. So, no one's, no one's looking to, uh, no one's looking to sue. Me or, or Box.net at the moment. Maybe there'll be somebody out there. Um, I'm not even t, times man of the year. So, um, but I did cost less than Zuckerberg. So, this will be, hopefully this will be kind of useful. Um, I think the real reason why I'm here and why I, I have some amount of information to share you is, is really simple. Um, I actually have gray hair. So, if you, uh, for, for the people who are in the front of the audience, you can actually see I have some gray strands of hair. If you're in the back, you can ask your friends in the front. Um, and the, uh, the real reason why I have this gray hair, can you, you can't, oh no, so the, the, the, the, the projector, you can't really see it. They really is gray hair. Okay. So, um, the reason I have this gray hair is because I've been in the valley for about five years now. We've been building up a company with, with a whole bunch of friends. And, uh, I've been through, you know, quite a bit and hopefully there's some lessons that, that might be useful, some, uh, exciting stories in terms of, as you're thinking about building companies, or as you're thinking about growing your organization. So, that's what I'm going to talk about and then we'll kind of open up for questions and see if this is, uh, if, if this is useful. Cool. So, um, first of all, what is Box? We've tried to build the easiest way for enterprises to manage and share and, and collaborate around data securely in the cloud. Um, so we're a solution that businesses will use to share content, to collaborate with people in and outside their work, organization, or be able to work from different mobile devices. But more broadly, make sure that they can work with lots of people around them. Uh, we have over five million end users. So this is more users than Salesforce.com or Workday or a number of other leading SaaS applications. There's 130 employees at Box. We're right in Palo Alto. So come by if you're ever buying, uh, uh, uh, electronic equipment at Fries. We're two, uh, stops over. We're right in the kind of Fries complex and we've raised about 33 million in funding from DFJ, from scale venture partners, um, from, uh, US venture partners. And so, uh, we've, uh, we've built up a pretty good base of, uh, of, uh, board members and some strong financing. So, um, the reason why we're, we're growing and the reason why Box has been successful so far is that enterprise technology today sucks. And people need better solutions than their businesses. And so we've basically built a solution that's cheaper, that's faster, that's more scalable, that's more connected, than any of the other technology out here. Has anybody heard of this company before or seen this product before? Okay, so for everybody that didn't raise their hand, you're going to live a lot longer by not having to work with this thing. But the, the challenge is most people in enterprises have to use this. This is a product built by Microsoft. It's very expensive. It's a, it's a multi-billion dollar product line for Microsoft. But most businesses and most enterprises have to work with it. And so, we've designed technology that's much easier for businesses to use, much faster and much more connected. And so I'd like to talk a little bit about the three stages of Box that we've been through. And, uh, essentially, they kind of, um, uh, will, will highlight the growth that we've been through and how we've developed our product. Our COO Dan Levin just walked in into the audience. Everybody say hi, Dan. Like three people said hi, so that's fine. So there's, uh, uh, there's really kind of three periods of Box. We, we started out in the early days. We were trying to figure out what we wanted to do, what we wanted to design. Then there's sort of a chasm period, right? This sort of gap where we're really trying to figure out who we are, who, what we're up to. And this is something that I think all enterprises and all companies and all startups will go through. And sometimes that's a compressed period of time or contracted period of time. In the case of Groupon. And sometimes it's a lot longer. And so you have to kind of figure out your way through that period and, uh, and make sure you're building something really special. So that's what I'm going to talk about today. So before Box, I was just your average college student. I wasn't invited to any parties, didn't get any girls, so I had a lot of time on my hand. And that's really why, why I got into entrepreneurship and starting companies. And so there were three companies that I started before Box, um, at the end of high school and into college. These were the three companies. So it was the zap.com. It was the fastest search on the first, uh, fastest search engine on the web, except for Google. And, uh, and that's usually a bad thing when you're, when you're kind of second fastest. And so, um, they really beat us and I'll get back at Larry and Sergey later in life. But, um, then there was so calendar, the, uh, easiest way to find events and entertainment in Los Angeles. The challenges I didn't like events are entertainment in Los Angeles. So that didn't really help. Um, and then finally we started fastest.com. This was in, in, uh, early period of college. Is it, is it sort of fast and fast as way you could buy and sell a home, which makes no sense because I've never owned a home. I've never wanted to buy a home and I've never sold a home. So you get the point. Don't start companies that make no sense to kind of what you're doing or what you're interested in. And so in 2005, this was sort of period of time where, um, where my co-founder and I were, we're working between lots of computers. We were sharing information with lots of our peers and lots of our colleagues. And we needed easier ways to share information. And so in 2005, we sort of got the idea to start box. No one was really using the cloud. Um, and back then it wasn't really the, uh, called the cloud. You sort of put files on a server and you could connect up to the, to the web server through, uh, uh, user interface. And we wondered why shouldn't, uh, why shouldn't you store your data online? Why should you carry around a thumb drive or, or have to log into FTP? Why is the IT department at our, at our school not able to give us really easy access to information? Back in 2005, the web mail at, uh, at my school offered 50 megabytes of email storage. And, and just to make things even more fun, they decided to delete emails after six months, automatically. So you can imagine the kind of IT environment we were working in. And, uh, and that of course that would never happen at Stanford. But, um, uh, we, we had a lot of problems and this is why we decided to start box. Essentially there was a really big delta in what was possible with technology and what was available with technology. We gave, uh, we, we decided to call 10 random people and ask a bunch of our friends, how do you store your data? How do you share your data online? And every single answer was different and every single answer was antiquated. Um, which really kind of presented an opportunity. We saw the market and we saw a giant gap in the market and it looked something like this. Um, and, and so, when you have that opportunity, where something you believe in should be possible and the technology's enabling that, that's a, that's a pretty good way to kind of start a business and that's how we got started with box. And there were some major new macro factors that led us, um, realized this was different than if we had started it back in 2000 when, when a bunch of the other companies that were doing this went out of business. The first is there's eight storage efficiency. Uh, everyone is probably familiar with Moore's Law, if not you should be, um, but every single, uh, 18 months and now even kind of sooner in a lot of cases, there's a doubling of, uh, performance and, uh, and, and efficiency and how we do our computing. And that was, uh, uh, and storage was no exception. So when we started the company in 2005, we could store eight times the amount of information in the same amount of space for the same amount of cost than you could have five years ago. And so this was a great opportunity for us to start the company with much lower costs and a much sort of easier way to scale up. Um, and there was also globalization and sort of remote, uh, remote workforces starting to emerge. So people wanted to work from anywhere. They wanted to be able to share information with anyone. And we were experiencing this first hand at school, but we sort of had this suspicion that other people had this problem as well. And you had Ajax, you had modern browsers, Firefox was just starting to come out, then you had much better bandwidth. Um, you couldn't have done this back in 2000 because, uh, it was much, uh, we had much slower internet. Uh, it was much harder to share information. You can't really share data at, at 56 kilobytes a second, um, but, uh, with broadband that really made it possible. And so we had these new macro factors that made box, uh, a better reality today. So we decided to commercialize the cloud. Let's, let's take something that's very fringe, something that, that, you know, some of the geeks and, and some of the other people will do on, on the edge of the market and really bring that to the masses. And, and that was a pretty good lesson. And so in the process, a lot of people said no, this is 2005, we're in college, people said well, it's going to be too expensive to scale this. You're not going to be able to, you know, raise the money to make that happen. You're too in experience, right? You don't, you've never done this before. Um, you're not going to be able to hire the people that it takes to do this. Um, and a lot of people said by our, our used Gmail, why, why don't I just email myself files? What's wrong with that? Why, why is that such a big deal? And then we thought to ourselves, what if the Beatles listened to everybody that said no? Where would we be with music, right? What, what if, what if everybody that says no in the process of starting something, you decided to listen to? And so we decided, um, we had to keep on going. We had to push on through it. Just in case Beatles is not a contemporary enough example, what about Justin Bieber? What, what if, what if he listened to everybody that said no? We wouldn't have this music that we have today. And so, and so this was, this is a pretty important lesson for us that we had to keep on pushing through. So we launched the product from our dorm room. We got a beta up and we launched the beta and we emailed everybody we knew. This is a pay only service at the time. It was $2.99 for a gigabyte of free space. Go to archive.org and you can kind of look at the initial versions of our website and the product. And we had just launched a site and it worked, right? We emailed all these bloggers, all of the press, all of our friends, everybody we could get our hands on. And it turned out people signed up and people wanted to use a really cheap cost-effective space on the internet. We had built a product that made sense and it was just took a couple months. We launched it from our dorm room and it started picking up. And we decided, well, maybe now we should go through the process that a lot of companies that we had heard of kind of went through, which is we need to finance more growth in the organization. So we need to get more users and we need to be able to enable more people to find out about us. And often that takes money. Now keep in mind we're at this time, we're 19 and we're 20 years old. And so it's a little bit difficult to raise venture capital when your co-founder looks like this. So that was, that's my CFO and co-founder, Dylan Smith. And he was our CFO, right? So you had to trust this guy with your money. And it's sort of hard to trust somebody who looks like they're going to run off to Disneyland with the proceeds. But there was one guy where this did fit and really well for us. His name is Mark Cuban. And we emailed Mark Cuban and we just sent a cold email and he said, hey, we got this really cool product. Maybe you like it. Maybe you could write about it on your blog. And it turned out he was really interested. He too believed that you should be able to share your data online, that you should be able to share and manage your information in the cloud. And so he wrote a check for us and that was it. And he invested in us while we were still in college. And we decided to really kind of grow a box. The problem is we couldn't focus on school and work. It's really not great customer support when you're answering customers in a counting class. And so that was the challenge that we were facing. We really wanted to grow. We wanted to be the best sort of customer-driven company that was out there. A lot of the companies that came prior started to have really weak products. They started not listening to customers. They started not supporting customers. And we had to be different. And we couldn't do this while also in school. So we looked at three main factors about maybe why should we leave school? How does one kind of make the decision to kind of take that leap? The first was there was just less upside. So if we looked at what it's going to be to take for us to stay in class and stay at pay attention when we felt like we had this really cool thing, the upside in doing it and going on our own was way higher. We just felt that if this worked out in both situations, we would be way better off if we just went for it. The second was we thought we had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We realized that everything was going to move to the web. We had a computing opportunity that had never really happened. Never come fully to fruition. And we thought that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Someone's going to do it. We can either be a part of that or not. We decided to go for it. And we had a lot of conviction in that. And frankly, realistically, no one else would hire me. I just knew that it was going to be way harder in the job market if I just didn't go off and start my own thing. And so we decided, let's drop out of school. At that point in time, it was a leave of absence. We knew we could leave absence. We knew we could always go back and we could always kind of reengage. And it's funny when you tell people like you're going to drop out of school, they freak out. It's like, what are you doing with your life? It's going to ruin it. And it's funny because on your head, you're thinking like, whoa, Michael Dell and Bill Gates, they dropped out of school. Whoa, Steve Jobs dropped out of school. But everybody forgets this guy, right? So it turns out the probability is more in becoming and doing this. I don't know if he dropped out, but he must have. But the point is, is that we had to, we had conviction. We thought it was going to be pretty exciting. So we left school. We drove up to, actually we drove down from Seattle to the Bay Area. We parked in Berkeley for a little while. We lived out of a garage. My uncle owns a garage there that is sort of like a house. It's kind of weird. And we lived there for a little while and then we ultimately moved to Palo Alto. We were kind of thinking, how can we grow this business faster? Right? We now have this business model that lets us charge for customers and charge to get users. We have this guy, Mark Cuban, who's helping fund us. How can we really reduce the barriers in doing this? And so we decided to launch a business model that is now fairly standard across these services. But at the time, it was really kind of taking a bet and saying, we're going to put some free space online and let people sign up and try it out. And so we introduced freemium. And this was the first kind of real thing that kicked off our business model. So instead of blocking users, instead of creating friction around how they were going to sign up for box, we decided to open it up for free, let you sign up for a free gigabyte of space, which now sounds like nothing. But back in 2006 when we launched this, this was like a really big deal. And we started getting hundreds of thousands of signups a quarter. And so all of a sudden we just started, we just tried to do this massive influx in users. And so people get upgrade and they could start paying for better versions of the product. But we decided to really kind of expand the awareness and the base by being more efficient. And this ultimately has become a very competitive advantage for us against traditional enterprise and kind of larger companies. So that was the sort of early period. We launched the company. We had our product. We knew we wanted to go to market. And now we sort of 2007, 2008, we really had to discover ourselves. We really wanted to figure out who we were, what we were building, where we're going. And this is sort of a really interesting period. The business model at this point really changed daily. So we, there's just a bunch of us. We would live and sleep out of the same place. And I guess those two things make sense. But we'd work and sleep out of the same place. Anybody's not living and sleeping out of the same place. Probably should figure out what's going on with themselves. And so we were at this point where a bunch of the guys would stay up all night, would keep the site up, would answer customer support. And by the end of the night, we'd have a completely different business model. Because what happened was any two people, any permutation of two employees that would stay up all night, would come up and concoct a completely different business model. It was awesome, but it was totally crazy and not something I recommend. But so we thought, well, maybe we should sell advertising. And then we'll make money off of all these users who are using the box account. And we'll start to have ads. And they'll see the ads in the product. We'll make money. That didn't make a lot of sense. Because our kind of application doesn't have the type of scale or volume that you need for media properties to be very interested. And we also thought, though, it hampered the user experience. We also looked at license revenue. Maybe we could license box to institutions like Stanford, or maybe we could take this to other places where they could use the technology and they could kind of wait label the product. And we weren't really in a position where we wanted to do that. We wanted to kind of own the user experience. We wanted to build the best thing that we could. And so we didn't really want to license the technology. We even thought, maybe you'll go to your box account and you'll like get all this cool media from guys like Sony and all these different places that were normally suing you. They'd send you this media. And we went to Sony in New York City. And they thought that was the stupidest idea. So they weren't that interested. And so we were at this point where we had to figure out our business model. And this will kind of take us into the period we were in today. We thought to ourselves, we could use state consumer. We could build a product for all of our friends, all of our family. We could be the best way that you can share photos. But then we looked at it. We thought about what is our opportunity to really innovate in that area? Who are we going to be competing with? We looked at Google and Microsoft. People that were going to just dramatically bring down the cost of storage for consumers. We looked at what Facebook was doing in photos. And we really felt that was a really great way that people were going to communicate. Can we really compete or be innovative in that area? We looked at the music space as I mentioned. But we really thought iTunes. And now we have Spotify. But there were sort of better products on the market that would let you share and consume music. And then we looked at the enterprise. And as I mentioned earlier on the Microsoft slide, the solutions that people had in their businesses weren't as innovative as we are. And we really thought that we could do it better than everybody else. And so, enterprise already have budget. They already spend collectively billions and trillions of dollars a year on this type of technology, of managing their data, of helping their businesses communicate, of enabling collaboration of all of their sort of IT strategies. So they have the money, right? Compared to us as consumers, we sort of care about every last dollar that we spend on anything. And so we needed to really, we needed to go after a market that could essentially pay for the service. And that's a thing called the business model. And we thought that was important. We could out-innovate the competition. So what's really interesting is traditional enterprise software, usually gets built and deployed in three-year release cycles. So that's why you have products called Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2010 and SharePoint 2007 and SharePoint 2010. Every three years, that product gets up to you. That means the second that it's in a customer's environment, it's already out of date. That means somewhere in some lab, somewhere at Microsoft, they're working on an all-new version. And that means you're always behind them. And so we knew we could out-innovate these older incumbents who were building technology in the old way. We could be more like a consumer company, deploy the software faster. And this would be a dimension where we could innovate and we could have a lot of competitive advantage. And our customers already wanted this. If we surveyed our customers at that time, they would say, we want easier ways to collaborate with our colleagues. We want easier ways to manage all the users in our business. And so it was a very natural evolution of the business model. But to do it really completely, we had to decide to go all in. We had to put our focus in one area because we really had to be as innovative as we could and build the best product possible. So we chose Enterprise. It was a sort of series of events that happened. We had an investor who was on the board of another SaaS or software as a service company that was selling enterprises. So we already had this sort of business model ideas about how we could do this. We had a consultant that was going and selling the product to other people and seeing if they would buy it. We listened to the customers and sort of thought about what we could do. And so we decided to go Enterprise. And it worked. Almost overnight, companies passed 10 to 100 times more for our product that we were beginning to upgrade and sell as more of an enterprise solution and where we were continuing to build up market features for. So instead of the story being about how can you share and manage your data with a couple colleagues or a couple of friends. It was all about how can a business implement a broader solution that they can use to share information across the organization. And they really found value in this because they were traditionally spending way too much money with legacy solutions that weren't solving their problems that weren't updating for how people wanted to work today. And we had a new kind of sales model which made us extremely competitive. And this is, I think, is an update that we're starting to see across the industry, across other sort of freemium businesses. We have a sales model where people actually call us. So we have a free version of the product that lots of businesses and lots of users use. But then people will actually call us when they want to upgrade for more security, more technology. And so we have a sales team that essentially is talking to people that are already really excited about the product. So it's an inversion on the business model where traditionally you go and call and email and market to a lot of businesses who aren't using your solution, who don't know about your product, who aren't qualified, who aren't educated about what you're doing. And we've done the exact opposite. So by the time we're talking to somebody on the phone, by the time we're selling to somebody, they're already using the product, it's already solving their problem, they already know it's the right solution for them. And so now we sort of hit 2009 and it's really a period where we need to scale the organization. It's all about growing. We had our business model, we knew what we needed to repeat and we really wanted to grow. So there's probably crossing the chasm. Okay, well, so everyone should read it just FYI. There's probably cliff notes or something or Wikipedia actually will get you pretty far. But crossing the chasm is a really seriously helpful book in terms of thinking about technology adoption, both in businesses and even the consumer landscape. And so after the chasm, after this period where where you really kind of have to jump over and be able to get to more pragmatic organizations less of the early adopters, it's really easy to get early adopters to, you know, user solution, email tech crunch, tech crunch, you know, reaches a lot of people and a lot of people sign up. But to get to the more conservative organizations, you really have to build up a much bigger business. And something that they really want to use and is more aligned for them. And so after the chasm, there's the tornado. And this is where a lot of adoption occurs. And what we're seeing is in the cloud, sort of computing space, where applications are moving from an on premise or hardware driven model to being a more web-delivered model, where we're hosting it in our environment and delivering it to you. We're starting to enter this tornado period. So you have Salesforce.com has really already kind of hit a large number of businesses. You have solutions like Workday and Success Factors that are beginning to be used as ways of people manage the actual employees in their organization. You have Gmail, which is starting to become very popular in businesses. And so we're really in this period where a lot of people are adopting the cloud. And so we said, we have to be number one. As all of these businesses are going to move to the cloud, we have to be in a position where we can talk to as many of them as possible, where as many of them as possible are using our product, where we can really deliver the solution as easily as possible. So since 2009, we've raised 25 million from those investors that I mentioned really to scale up. We wanted to build the best organization possible. And so it was really about building the best team we could. We hire out of Google, out of Intuit, out of Salesforce.com, out of Microsoft, LinkedIn, eBay. So we want to be able to bring talents from lots of different kinds of organizations to help us grow and really build the organization. And so this is something that we've really focused on. How do we bring the best possible people into our organization? And we borrow from everyone. So the lot of product innovation that happens in the consumer web in terms of how we're much more social, how we're much more connected, how our applications actually talk to each other. So if you're using Facebook and how you might interact with Farmville, which is really fun. And then and see those updates on, is anybody played cityville? Okay, wrong demo. Okay, got it. So so all these applications can now talk to each other. And we want to bring that idea and that philosophy into the enterprise where you're going to be able to interact among multiple applications and have this data talk to each other seamlessly. That's an idea from the product and enterprise web, but we're bringing it to the cloud. We take marketing ideas from Hollywood. So how do you do big launches? How do you make a lot of noise? How do you get people to pay attention to your product as opposed to everybody else? And support from Zappos, right? A company that is totally known for how great their customer support is when you're buying shoes. But why is it that when you want to talk to somebody in an enterprise software company, it's so much harder to get their attention? Right, it feels like they're only selling to you. It doesn't feel like they're supporting you. And so we've been able to redesign the sales organization to be much more customer-centric than any enterprise software has ever become. And these are the things where you can take lessons from the different organizations out there that have competed on your behalf for solving some other problem. And we're bringing it to market in our own way. And so we've been able to borrow from a lot of lessons from other places. Culture, at this point, will make or break us. We're at 130 people, right? The next 130 people matter a whole lot to make sure that they're people that we really want to work with that are going to continue to drive the innovation of BoxFord that are really going to be able to take us to the next level. So my co-founder and I still approve all offers. We make sure that we are still building an organization. And we make sure we still have the discipline to build a company that has the kind of people we want around, the kind of people we want to work with. We want fun people, we want energetic people, we want a lot of really quick, low ego, very collaborative people. We want people who are very relentless. So you have to balance motivation, but also the capability to get the actual work done. And this is, it's hard to find the exact people you want to work with. And we make sure we have the discipline to continue doing that. And we let go of the people that don't. Because ultimately, life's too short to not build an organization that you want to work at. And that's the greatest opportunity, I think, for starting companies and helping found companies, being early at companies, you get to define what kind of organization you want to build. And so it's a lot of fun, where we're building up a culture that matters the most. And so it's a bit, sorry. I apparently can't drink water. So can we edit this out of the video? Is this live streaming on like Twitter or something? Okay, okay, cool, actually, who's using Twitter right now? Anybody tweet anything yet? Do you say something good or something? Okay, cool. Okay, so today's vision is to build a different kind of enterprise software company, right? Traditionally, enterprise software companies aren't the types of businesses that, you know, people, your age or my age or different ages decide to start, right? It's a much slower industry. The development takes a lot longer. You're not always the same cost, you're not always building something that you can use. And we're trying to build a company that changes that, right? So we're trying to build a technology that is extremely innovative, something that we want to use all day long. In fact, we're doing a major announcement tomorrow of a completely new version of the application. The person coincidentally, who's leading up the development of that application right now was the CEO of a company that got started out of Stanford, Kimber Lockhart and Jeff Cybert, who were both very involved in ETL and Bases. We were very fortunate to be able to bring their company into ours about a year and a half ago. Now, Kimber's leading the whole development of this brand new version. So we're all about building new kinds of software, new kinds of technology, and delivering in a different kind of way. So that's what we're doing at Box. And I thought, as if I haven't shared enough information, there's maybe like three or five kind of quick lessons that hopefully will be useful in terms of as you're thinking about building a company. The first is, oh, actually this is an lesson, but this is a reminder. You're really, really fortunate. Seriously, there's very few places in the world where we have as much opportunity as we do. People are literally underwriting our ability to go change the world and not taking advantage of that as a complete waste. And so Silicon Valley is sort of like the Disneyland of capitalism where you can really choose what you want to do, what you want to work on. Assuming it's really exciting. Assuming some people think that they're going to change the world with you, that they might make money in the process, then you can build whatever you want. So that's really important. So lesson one, do something that wasn't possible three years ago. Pretty much if you're looking at a business opportunity that you could have done five or 10 years ago, it might be too late or it might not be different enough to make a lot of people care. And that's ultimately what it takes to kind of scale. And so look for new technologies that are enabling your solution, right? Box wasn't possible in 2000. It wasn't possible to scale up in 2000. The enabling technology was cheaper storage, better browsers, more connected devices, more really kind of faster internet, cultural changes, right? What made Facebook possible that we want to share information and we want to be more connected or macro trends? What are the sort of macroeconomic trends where people want to save money? So all of a sudden we go buy things half off a group on that we don't really want. Those types of things are really important to starting a business. Do something that you're extremely passionate about. This is another lesson that I've learned over the first three things that I had started in college. If you're not really passionate about what you're doing, it's totally great. You'll be excited about it. Maybe when things are going well, it's going to be really hard to get other people passionate about what you're doing. And ultimately, it's really hard to kind of think out five years. Where is your company going to be five years from now? Do you really want to be doing what you're working on? Startups are very hard, right? There's a lot of bad news that happens every single day. Buy things in competitive space, buy things with hiring, and you have to be able to push on through. You have to do something that's actually really, really exciting that you're going to be inspired about. And that you're going to create inspiration for other people. Don't compromise. As I was mentioning earlier, one of the coolest things about starting your own company is you get to make a lot of decisions, right? You don't actually have to compromise or sacrifice on a lot of things. You don't have to sacrifice on who you work with. You don't have to compromise on how you're going to do your marketing or how you're going to build your technology. So we think about things in terms of best. What's the best team that we can build to solve this problem? What's the best technology we can produce to solve this problem? What's the best way we can talk about this and communicate it with our public relations? How can we do the best marketing? So ultimately, this is all in your control. You get to make these decisions, and it's a really exciting opportunity when you do. And lesson four is, if you feel comfortable, you're probably not doing it right. I mean, there's a lot of hard decisions that go into business. Who you're going to work with. How you're going to compete? What's the strategy? Are you going to raise money? Are you going to leave school? And so you're going to have to go well be on your comfort zone. There's a lot of decisions that aren't going to be very easy to make. And that's actually a good sign. So it's actually a good thing when you don't really know what the answer is. Or you don't know if you should do it this way. And you make that leap. And that's pretty important. And also, finally, don't write your obituary twerly. This is a mistake that we've made a handful of times. And fortunately, we didn't do it in such a way that we couldn't work our way out of. But we've been extremely competitive with Google and Microsoft and EMC and these other larger companies. Normally, we should be afraid of. And the venture capitalists are often afraid of these guys. And so write yourself off. Make sure that you keep on pushing. Make sure that you're optimizing on the right dimensions and areas that you can beat other people in. And so that's really important and why we still have a company today. And if it turns out these five lessons don't work for you, we're actually hiring. So we are really excited by people that start their own companies. But we're also excited about people who are passionate about learning in companies that are quickly growing and want to be a part of that. And I think while I do push heavily on starting companies getting out there and trying things, there's as much value and going to startups right now and learning for yourself how companies are being built. Because maybe it's two years later that you start that company. But at least being in the environment and learning first hand with what goes on is extremely helpful. And I think both routes are incredibly important. But just don't work for McKinsey or something like that. But I think that definitely join startups and have a good time while you're doing it. So that's my presentation. It was 33 minutes. So we didn't take too much time. We're all good. And so what do we do now? We're going to take questions. OK, good. OK, thank you very much. So what do you want to rule? I have one rule up. I was promised no hard questions. No, no. We said really hard questions. So OK, I'm just heard. Yes, we're going to start with students in 178. Anybody have a question? No, no. OK, well then I'm going to ask. Heidi's going to ask him. I'm going to start. This came up actually. We had a blog ahead of time where we all commented about what we were going to ask you to do. One of the questions that came up was, you started a business with your best friend. Yes. And you remained best friends even while you lived together, worked together. And one of students wanted to know. And I wish that student wanted to ask, but I'll ask instead. There must have been some tough times. There must have been some really challenging moments. And yet you're still best friends, and you're still running a company together. Can you share a few war stories about how you got through some of those tough times for you and your job at home? Do you recommend starting a business with your best friends? Yeah, great question. Wow. OK. So the good news is my best friend wasn't named Eduardo. So that made things a little bit easier. So Dylan and myself and actually the third and fourth employees of Box, we actually all went to high school together up in Seattle. And so we knew each other extremely well. We already kind of knew each other's ticks. Like Dylan likes to save money. So don't ask to borrow money from him, right? That's just like a no-no. And so we were an opportunity where we had already collaborated for a very long time. I realized that it's extremely unusual in terms of starting companies in college. But I think we both, us and even the third and fourth guys that we went to school with, we all realized that we're trying to have the most amount of fun. We're trying to have the largest amount of impact. We're trying to not let the things that happen in the business world impact our own relationships. What's also interesting, though, to be fair, is our relationships have over time transitioned in to being more business oriented relationships. And so we're often talking about business. We're talking about the technology, talking about the product. And so it's sort of almost hard to separate the two at this point. When you are, when I shared a bedroom with two other guys for six months, and this was not a submarine. This was in a regular room. And when you get to know people that well, there's a certain kind of humming that can happen. And you're sort of everyone's thinking each other's thoughts. And there's a lot of excitement. But it can be a risk. There's a lot of situations where people have separated from their co-founders. There's a lot of situations where people have separated from their partners in life, right? And that hasn't worked out. So there's really many ways that that can end up. I would just recommend being as open, as communicative, as possible. Make sure that everyone's on the same page all times. The one benefit, not the one, there's many big benefit to starting companies with people you do know is there's a much higher degree of trust. We've been able to almost through peer pressure just that is sort of social in nature and subtle in nature make sure that we're all in this together at all times. And it's this level of bond, which means that we know that no one's going to leave if something goes wrong or if there's going to be a problem. That's a level of, I think, tightness that comes when you have a bigger and better relationship with people. But over time, you also have to build those kinds of relationships with the new people that come into box. And so we've tried to create that type of familiarity with everyone that we're working with. So how's that for a really long answer that maybe didn't answer your question? Good. Good. OK. We have a question here. Maybe this is too simple of a question, but why do you think those software giants did not crush you? Well, it's not too late for them to crush us. So let's knock on wood. But I think what's great is when you have a technology and a company that's super focused, we have 130 people, about two miles away that spend, hopefully on a good day, 14 hours, some days, 10 or 12 hours, focusing just on how are we going to grow and build the absolute best technology to manage and share data. No organization has that level of focus. We're 100% of their time. 100% of the conversations that they have, 100% of the line of their organization is toward one goal. If you go to Microsoft, they actually have seven solutions competing with us. Among another 150 things, Xbox Connect. So can we be an organization like that? Yes, if we focus and if we compete on dimensions that they're not going to be very good at, things like verality, things like customer experience, things like product experience. And ultimately, it's a very big market. So we don't have to put Microsoft out of business. I'm not saying short Microsoft right now. But there's a very big space. And we're playing an important area in that space. And we're trying to just bring the best technology we can to our customers. And usually if you do that, good things happen. You might not crush everybody. And that's not necessarily a goal anyway. It's really to bring about new change in the space. And I think your odds are on your side for you to have a pretty good opportunity with that. So don't compete with Facebook right now, probably. The network effects are too strong. But maybe unless you got something brilliant, but yeah, cool. So opinions on Dropbox. And do you see it to be a direct competition to a box.net in your fire's time? Cool. So are there any other questions in the audience? Is there anybody who knows a little less about this space? So great question. So Dropbox, I think, is a really great way that you can manage and share your own personal data. Especially if you have a Mac, a PC, an iPhone, all these kinds of devices. That's something that we've tried to solve. We try and solve, and we get better at every day. But our big focus and big difference is that we're trying to enable enterprises to share and manage all of their data. So it's not just about you and your computer. It's actually about all the people that you're working with, all of the applications that you're working from. So if you're working in Salesforce.com, or if you're working in Net Suite, or if you're working on an application like SugarCere, you can bring your data to those places. This is a very kind of business-oriented areas that we compete on. And it's a really important area. We want to both make sure that people are using the product at an end user level. But most importantly is we're building a technology that the enterprise itself can adopt. And we're just doing that in a very different way than what traditional enterprise companies have done. You mentioned earlier about boring marketing from Hollywood. Okay. So what marketing bot.net does it do you have right now? Got it. Well, let's see here. My co-founder was never on TMZ, so it wasn't that. Although he was on a TV show, I will not take questions about that. You should research that yourself. It's kind of funny and awkward. But so there's, I think positioning yourself in the market is extremely important. These are the kind of things that you should get right early on, but usually you can't get really right until you have more users, until the market itself is kind of created and better understood. And so things like publicity and marketing and these kind of things, we've just gotten way better at overtime. Does anybody here have a car? Is that okay? Okay, like three people, good. So if you've ever been on the 101, it's a highway near here. We actually have two billboards right now that are announcing the new version of our product. And so we wanna make sure that we're standing out in the space that people are paying attention to this change in enterprise software. And there's a lot of things that we're doing to make that happen. You said, kind of last time, right here, it's really too early. Yes. We'll do three previous companies, you clearly wrote your history at a decent time. Yes. Quite too late actually. How do you know the difference between the idea, like Zipps App, where you're saying, you know if you better shut it down versus the box where you're saying, we've got some competition where we can do this. Great, great question. So with Zipps, it was just obvious. Like that was just a stupid idea. Like that, it didn't make any sense. We weren't actually faster. We probably weren't even the 10 fastest site on the internet for searching. And so that was just, we kind of knew it, right? That was a gut check. But there's this philosophy of fail fast, right? You want to test things on the market and you want to turn them off if they're not working. And your ability to succeed as a startup goes up with your ability to do that, right? Because you're constantly iterating, you're constantly trying new versions of new ways and new experiences of doing things. So you have to be able to turn things off. I think there's one part, science for some of this stuff, like literally if there's no uptake, maybe it's, you know, you're truly early in the market. You haven't marketed the right way. Make sure to kind of revisit, you know, what you're doing or what that looks like. As it relates to kind of competitive threats, it's important to really think about how people are gonna be competing with you on what are the factors that they're gonna compete with you on and how you can, how you essentially can compete with them in ways that it's not possible for them, right? So for a solution like Microsoft or EMC or some of these Lodger Enterprise companies, we're able to do something that would require them to essentially cannibalize some major revenue streams. So we can actually compete with them and on a dimension at a scale that we don't think they're very good at. And we think that's gonna create a pretty big advantage for us. I think in other areas, it's a much softer kind of, you know, question and that you have to ask yourself. But I think continuing to iterate, continuing to make sure that the product, you know, likes what you're doing is gonna be pretty important. And I'm sure that there'll be other speakers this quarter that can walk you through the rest of that. You mentioned earlier that when you have a great idea at hand that you know, I have that potential with impact to get it out on the market and get feedback really soon. But how do you help who to trust for feedback? And especially with your philosophy of openness, how do you go into like the company and you're sure that no one thinks your idea and implement it before you do it? Or you might get sued for some of the property or ideas you share. Yeah, so that's a good question. So sort of differentiation and defensibility and kind of how to create kind of some barriers around that with your product, especially as you're beginning to test it out. I think there's some pretty, so that the quick answer is just give it out to people that you trust at first. You know, I think that assuming your friends aren't out to crush you, you could probably trust them with your product. You know, of course, the Winkle Voss is probably the same thing. But I think that, you know, if you can, if you can have other people around you try the product and really educate, you know, you on what's going on and how you what you should do. That's pretty important. I actually think that, so it's interesting. So on one hand, you have to kind of go your own route and you have to be able to deflect all the people that are telling you know. On the other hand, you probably should listen to everybody and it's your responsibility to synthesize what people are telling you and making sure you're making the decision on based on that information. We got a lot of feedback that was sort of negative in nature or critical in nature that ultimately was super helpful, right, with the product development. When that person said, but what about Gmail, then we realized that the market might say, what about Gmail? So we have to build a product and we have to build marketing, we have to be able to build a solution that solves that problem. And so, you know, offer that to early people, beta access, you know, private alpha, you know, one of these, you know, some other kind of, you know, Greek letter or whatever is probably fine or Latin, what language is that Dan? Okay, cool. Oh yeah, I don't know, you guys are pointing. Okay. So I'm sort of wondering with the mobile space growing. So, how do you see open or, oh, almost a drop box, box fitting into sort of that mobile space and, you know, enterprises may be moving to people doing more from their phones and doing more from, you know, on the go versus just in the house. Yeah, so mobile is huge for us. When I looked back at our original sort of business kind of plan and perspectives that we wrote in 2005 and we actually had this section for mobility and we said, people are going to want to access their data on mobile phones. What's funny is at the time, the only concept we have for mobile phones is like a flip phone and we thought we like SMSU your document. So it was like totally crazy. But then, you know, God bless Steve Jobs, iPhone, totally changed the whole market, Android came along, we had these way more powerful systems, some way more powerful platforms that were way more open and there were a lot of people kind of competing on our behalf. So we don't have to go make gigantic partnerships just to be able to get on your phone that that's really important. And so now enterprises, starting about a year ago, they really started to pay attention to this new way of mobility. It wasn't just about, we're going to have blackberries in our organization, we're just going to have windows phones, things like the iPad have really been adopted by enterprises more than we expected. And so what that has created is an opportunity where mobility is way more important for organizations and not just mobility of how you access your email or how do you kind of communicate with people on these phones, but actually how do you get rich business applications, rich business data on these devices. And so I'll give you an example. So does anybody golf? Okay, you heard of the company Taylor made? Okay, so Taylor made it's like a major golf manufacturer and supplier. And so they have a bunch of iPads and they go to the people that they need to be able to sell their solutions to and they've decided to use iPads for that process instead of printing out and kind of using laptops for all this information. Now to do that, they have to get the data from their organization to these iPads. And so what do you think they chose? Box, good, let's say I answered that question like that, very good. And so they implemented Box, they implemented our enterprise solution to be able to solve that problem. And now they have 100 networked iPads that are getting this data. And so the iPad alone was a new macro factor that caused our business to grow and that created a new opportunity. And that was, so you can't ever predict what how these macro factors are going to change, but your ability to respond to them, that's what you can do. And so we want to be at the center of the sort of mobile business ecosystem and make sure that we have the best ways that people can manage and share their data on these mobile devices. OK, we'll do this. Yeah, you said you called emailed Mark Cuban. Yes. And I just, I don't know, I wanted to hear a little bit more about that and like how you get money from Mark Cuban when you're 19 years old. Yeah, OK, so I was 20 and my covenor was 19. If that helps. That won't change the answer too much. But so yeah, great question. So it was great. We were at a point where we actually didn't know the rules of business at this point. So we thought emailing Mark Cuban was like the thing that you do. You send a billionaire an email and maybe who respond. And in this case, I promise you we freaked out when he did respond because it was like, what is going on? We're in this alternate universe. What's funny, this is before on tarage and stuff. And I'm sure he started getting like 1,000 of those emails every single day after he financed turtles to kill a company or whoever did that. I don't even know. So we called emailed Mark Cuban. We did ask for investment. We said, take a look at our new product. We'd love you to write it on your blog. He's got a site called BlogMavric. And he decided to write about the product. And he got really interested in it. And he said, well, this is kind of interesting. Do you guys need money? And so it was sort of by starting the relationship very casually that we engaged him and he became pretty interested. And we just got super lucky. But the last thing I think that can apply to other things, we've done this a lot since then, is you just can't predict, right? Who's going to respond to what? And so the sort of relentlessness that you have to have and growing your business and building your company and making sure to continue to push on every possible way that you can is really important. Because we're not in the business of predicting who's going to respond to us, who's going to care about us. But we're in the business of telling as many people as possible. So it worked out. I don't know that it works out today. Try it on Peter Teal. We'll see what happens. So. Thanks, Greg. Yep. So you talked about Morris Law, especially like enabling the SAS model in terms of a decreased new cost of technology, especially for storage. Yes. For example. But as Morris Law, I guess, extension as it progresses and data be stored for, and then all these things get even more cheap. Do you think that would have any effects on, for example, the SAS model in terms of if you've met up with him and do this for really cheap? Why do they do it off-site when they can just do it? They're not by themselves in their own site without the security concerns. Any other associated problems for the SAS? Yeah. So the question was, if Morris Law benefits us, why doesn't also equally benefit our customers on building their own infrastructure? Is that right? So yeah, totally neat question. So the two things. One is we're building an application that we think really adds a tremendous amount of value on top of the storage layer. The area that Morris Law is actually affecting, Morris Law is not enabling us to build a better user experience and product to help you collaborate. It's making our cost much cheaper. And so that's pretty important. So we have that as sort of a pretty big advantage. But what's happening is it's not so much the issue for enterprises isn't so much that it was too expensive to manage the hardware in their organizations. It was that they had to become more agile, and they had to become a little bit more strategic in terms of how they thought about the technology that they were bringing in. And so we actually did this on our own. We actually used to use Outlook and Exchange. And we used to have email servers in our company that manage our email. And the day that we moved over to Gmail, it was this big difference. Instead of figuring out how to back up our email servers, instead of how to figure out how to make sure our email servers were connected to the outside of the world, instead of having to manage the security around that, RIT administrator instantly turned on Gmail and Google handle all that security. And it was much easier for us. And so those are the factors that I think we're starting to recognize is that IT organizations and businesses are trying to become much more strategic about their technology. And so they're beginning to implement solutions that other people are helping power, assuming the security is there, assuming the scalability is there. And so the reason why Moore's law is super great for us is that we can take all of these organizations data, and we can actually constantly stay on top of the latest technology trends, because we have the economies of scale and motivations to do so, much more than all of our customers could if they were disaggregated. And so that's why we can build up a pretty big platform in that sense. But it will certainly be interesting to see how this emerges. Maybe there'll be a server that's this big, and you hold it in your pocket. And then that'll disrupt us again. So we'll see what happens. Let me back there. Speak up really loud. Yeah. You keep mentioning culture. You said you had 30 people. How do you keep that culture going when it was like the same small group of you guys? You guys are buddies. Now I was at extent of 130 and beyond. And is it a culture of innovation? You take innovation from inside, or how does that work? Yeah. So this is something that we spend a lot of time on. We have a large portion of not necessarily disproportionate, but a good portion of our management attention is on how do we build out the culture and the right way as we scale. So if you think about it, someone we hire today as just someone who's going to be an engineer, or someone who's going to be in sales, will actually probably, if they're really good, be a manager in six or 12 months from now. And that means that because of the rate at which we're growing our organization. So we have to hire people today that can actually be leaders later. And that's really critical. And so first is just the criterion of who you're hiring. The qualifications of that individual are hiring process to make sure we're bringing in people that we want to work with, that we think are skilled enough to be able to be really innovative and be able to work really hard. And we push on people and set really big goals. So you can actually start to see what people can't meet those goals. What kind of people aren't fitting in this high performance, really quick environment. Because that's the only way we're going to be competitive. We're in the business of getting a lot of people together, building a really good technology. And the only way we can do that is if we have the best people to do that. And so we have to make sure we're constantly hiring the best people. We have some sort of mechanisms that help us do that. And what was the second part of your question? Are you bringing in innovations? Yes, great. So innovation is critically important. I actually need to read some more books on this in terms of, what happens to companies when they stop innovating? Why does that happen? That totally sucks. And as a startup, everything you do matters so much. Your leverage is just the people that you're working on that project with. Nobody's there for the paycheck. You're there to really change as much as you possibly can. And so you want to maintain that when you have 100 people, when you have 500 people, when you have 1,000 people. And so we have a couple of forcing functions that help with that. We have this thing that Facebook certainly popularized the hackathon. So once every three or six months, all of our engineers stay up all night and they can work on any single project that they want to is totally up to them. And that gives us an opportunity to have things that are outside of the day-in, day-out business that let us figure out what new is out there that we want to work with. Work on. Google has the 20% time. We do this more in a consolidated period where we're going to put out a lot of work. And so what comes from that is we are the first company to release HTML5, drag and drop file uploading and technology like that in this space. We have this thing that's launching tomorrow, which enables box to be real time. And so it's going to be really powerful. And that's a, it's these kinds of things that just don't make their way on the regular product management, sorry, product roadmap. And so you have to be able to have forcing functions that say, how are we going to do this in a completely new way? And then I think finally, we just try and encourage it across the organization. Every problem that we're trying to solve, whereas collaborative as we can to solve it, and we look for the best sort of way that we can solve that problem. And we don't necessarily just look at what is the, what if other organizations we've done, we actually look at what should be possible and what should we do. So a lot of stuff going to it. There's not a sort of a single way that you do that. But it definitely takes a lot of discipline to make sure it continues throughout your organization as you hire people. Right, over there. I have like a two-part question. Oh, I know. I think you have really loudly there. I know you studied business back when you did attend school. Number one, how much of that is actually applicable to what you guys are doing now? Number two, when you were starting, were you programming at the same time, or did you guys hire external programmers, like freelancers and stuff like that? Sure. Sure. So I didn't probably get far enough along with my education where I took relevant courses. So is that that period where you sort of read about like Othello? And then you somehow try and think how that would apply to cloud computing. But so I just didn't get far enough along in that journey. I actually also tried to have sort of a diverse mix of courses, took some film stuff, some communication stuff, tried to blend a lot of things. I certainly learned how to like whiteboard in college. That was those useful. But now actually to make up for it, read a lot of books. And so I sort of call it the bathtub MBA. So you can actually read a lot of books in a bathtub session. So OK, that's fine. So a lot of books, cross in the chasm, books like Blue Ocean Strategy really recommended, positioning is a great book. So the good thing is a lot of people are writing about this stuff, and you can read a lot about it. And you can watch seminars like this online to catch up for it. So I think a lot of the early stuff was intuition. And the fact that we had already been working on internet stuff with the people that we ultimately kind of co-founded and that kind of came onto box. And so already kind of knew about the product stuff. So when we were first starting box, it was co-founded by myself and our CFO. And I was actually throughout college. I was sort of an amateur web designer and did a lot of kind of product stuff and put together stuff on the web. But for some of the initial kind of backend coding, we actually got some other folks to do. I couldn't convince any of my engineering friends. So we put the prototype up that was built. And then the great thing of our two, our VP of technology, and our VP of technical operations that we went to high school with ultimately joined us to run the kind of two technology parts of the business. So all the servers and all the scaling of those servers, and then all the code and the architecture of that technology. But business programs are really good. I do think they are actually important. Pay attention to everything and do your stuff. Great, please. We're going to take one more question back in the very back. Speak really loud. So you talked about these, we were founded five years ago. We talked about, we're a replacement share point, we talk about Facebook, we place my space. Why are you doing to make sure that in five years, someone's not spending where you are with a big line and slash through your name, talk about how out of date and inefficient you are. I know, doesn't it suck? It's like, I don't know. I mean, I make fun of Steve Balmer so much that it probably out of karma, it'll happen. Great question, by the way, and hopefully you'll help with that roadmap. We, I think that right now as an organization, we are so motivated to build the best product possible. We're so motivated in terms of always staying ahead of the market. If that motivation changes, right? And I think what happens is at some point in organizations, they might either be more profit seeking, or they might be really kind of in just like, let's let it ride kind of mode. But there's a lot of organizations where that hasn't happened. And I think we're trying to learn from the organizations where there is this constant drumbeat of innovation, where there is this constant drumbeat of, let's have some forcing functions for us to constantly improve the technology, where we can always kind of be a step ahead of the market. And so something that I personally do is basically on a weekly basis, just look at how the market has changed. Look at what people are doing, what is our competitive strategy that's going to keep us ahead in different areas. And we actually do a lot of things internally to make sure we have a lot of momentum around the areas where the best at. And so we can stay ahead in those areas, and we can also stay competitive in the areas where we're not the best. And so, you know, check it in five years. We'll see where we're at. But I think that if you constantly treat your organization as a startup, and you constantly think about how do you stand out and hand it how do you stay ahead, I think it's a much better way to not kind of ultimately get disrupted by something that's going to come in be cheaper or faster. Now they certainly might say that, but we're going to make sure that's not possible. Great. Thank you so much. Thank you. This is absolutely wonderful. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
