 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these elections online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Today's guest is Dave Evans, who wants to help you design your life. At Apple, he led the team that developed the original mouse, and later at Electronic Arts, he became the company's first vice president of talent. Now, he helps organizations build creative environments and teaches in Stanford's department of mechanical engineering. Here's Dave Evans. So we're here to talk about this design. How design thinking might apply to your life? That's not starting a company, but managing your life if you're going to start a company is a pretty challenging thing. So what this thing is all about. For example, Bill Brunett, my partner who is not here, he's actually doing something similar to another building on the campus right now. So 10 years ago, Bill and I got together, had lunch, started talking about this thing, and said, hey, let's do this in the summer of 2007, and that turned into what is now called the Life Design Lab. And if the Life Design Lab our mission is very simple, it is to apply the innovation principles of design thinking to the wicked problem of designing your life at or after university. That's a carefully crafted elevator pitch, all the colored words. If you click on them, you get a white paper. Most people go, what does that really mean? That sounds great. That sounds like a VC pitch. No, we teach the classes that help you figure out what you want to be when you grow up. And then everybody goes, oh, kind of take the class. So that's a better question. Actually, it's a lousy question. The way we reframe that is it's not what you want to be when you grow up. It's what you want to be next as you continue growing. All right? And what all the people who are done growing up, please raise their hand. Who hopes that never happens? Totally. Let's just not do that. That's a bad idea. Now, we teach a bunch of courses here. We teach designing your life that kind of signature course to juniors and seniors, many of them. We teach designing your Stanford, to freshmen and so on. So I figure out how to go to college in a certain designerly sort of a way. We actually teach designing the professional graduate students, master students, PhD students, including business, you're going to business students? Not that you're busy. Okay, we have law students, we got med students, we got a couple law, a couple of, okay. So anybody, come on down. It's actually just like designing your life, but it has a bigger word because you're probably getting a PhD. And so we teach as it turns out, on the order of 15 to 20% of all the students here at Stanford, that's actually a lot of people. And these are short people, they should know what they're doing with their lives. Why is that happening? Well, you know, what's going on is, you know, the experience of being a person and being smart doesn't necessarily mean being clear. So what does Stanford students sound like? Well, if you ask them how life at Stanford is going, this is what it sounds like. It's also. Amazing. Let's go in. Happy Stanford students, okay. Most people on the farm are pretty happy. How many students have we here? How many of you are generally happy with the, okay, if I just say out of question. Yeah, now let's raise the bar a little bit. And what, now what, what are you going to do after you leave? Yeah, that would be interesting. I was going to go to med school, but some grades changed that. I think I'm going to go to law school. You can listen, listen. My personal favorite right there. I have no idea. I have no idea what I'm going to do after college. Sometimes I guess I tell myself I don't really know the story, but I really probably should be. Okay, now that actually those films were taken at a career fair. Okay, little name tags where my name is, I'm at a career fair. I'm already to pitch myself to the world and these are the answers you're getting. Now, by the way, this was really easy film to get. Let me be very clear. We didn't wait like for three days to get the six really clueless Stanford students and make them look bad. You know, that was not the deal. The deal is that's a pretty normal response. Well, now why is that? What is going on? What's the problem? Well, the problem is what we call dysfunctional beliefs. Ideas that are untrue or ungenerative and not helping they're getting in the way. So, okay, where at Stanford we're talking about students, has a big student dysfunctional belief from sitting on the quad, you're having a conversation about what, of course, what you're studying. So what's your major? Well, I'm a majoring in creative writing. The next question is, what are you going to do with that everybody knows? That's the question. And if you in fact you're majoring in creative writing, what are you going to do? Be unemployed. That's right. You know what you're going to be. Now that turns out to be a massively dysfunctional belief. It turns out within 10 years of graduation, 80% of people with a college back of Florida are working outside their field of major study. The correlation between what you study and what you do is extremely low. How many of you over the age of 35 are still doing the thing you study doesn't undergrad? Are you willing to say I'm over 35? Okay, it's not zero. Here's the deal. So that's, it just doesn't work. It's just stupid. Now dysfunctional belief number two, our personal favorite, what's your passion? What's your passion? You're passionately entrepreneurial, aren't you? You are, aren't you? You know your passion, right? How many of you have been asked the question, what's your passion in the last week? Keep your hand about if you asked somebody else that question. Okay, cut it out. The research demonstrates that eight out of ten people answer the question, either I don't know or which one did you want me to start with. Now in either case, zero or many, what's your passion is Lausier guidance? It may be wonderful. We're kind of getting a rep as the anti-passion, guys, that's not fair. We're not anti-passion. We're anti-presuppositional singular passion as an organizing principle preceding all other behaviors. You knew upfront and it was going to work out fine. If you happen to know that passion clearly and you are competent to do it and the world is interested in it at the same time commercially, great, you're called lucky. That's what we call that. But that's not a good place to start. For most people, passion is the outcome, not the input. It's the end of the game, not the beginning of the game. Number three, you should know by now. In fact, if you haven't got yourself most of the way down the Yellowbrook Road, try the city of Oz that you're pretty sure is where the cool stuff is happening, you're probably late. You're supposed to be a smart, safe person if you're one of our students. How many of you have ever felt late for what? There is no such thing. You're just here. I got a call back on him. Tim, who's a sales guy at Oracle many years ago, and he calls him and goes, hi, David, go, well, how low, Tim, how are you? He goes, well, I'm late. I go, well, why'd you call? Call me later. No, no, no, I'm three years late. He was 33. And he said, he was three years late. I said, I don't think so. He goes, no, it really am. Trust me, I'm really three years behind. We argued for a year about whether or not he was behind or here. At the end of which he finally concluded he was here, thank God, because then he's four years late. But we're just, you know, that is not necessarily true. Everybody's figuring it out on their own merit. So it's time to think a little bit differently. Yeah, that means it's just time to think like a designer. Now, to understand design thinking, whom of you had some introduction to design thinking, bootcamp, whatever, you know this stuff. You seen the caterpillar. Okay. Now, I'm going to position design thinking in the context of other forms of thinking. Design thinking is great. It's like super hot on Stanford campus. It's great in the innovation and venture world, which is true and wonderful and appropriate, but it's not the only tool in the box. Depends on the problem set you're dealing with. In engineering, you know, there's lots of good engineers here in campus from the engineering quad. I have two engineering degrees from Stanford. You solve your way forward. You know enough information. You know the algorithms, the equations. You can actually solve for the problem and get it right. You can actually fix things and they work. Now, in business thinking, look, I've got business people in their room, right? When are you right in business? Never. Okay. You're never right in business. You're just winning or losing, right? And you're winning a little more or winning a little less. You optimize. You never have a big enough market share, a big enough profitability, high enough customer satisfaction or delight or loyalty. Strong enough competitive barriers to entry. You're never done with that stuff. You just move forward in an optimizing sort of way. And if you're smart enough, you even do it in a quantified optimizing sort of way. Like we do here at Stanford. Now, if you're a researcher, we do a lot of that. We PhD candidates, and we're going to PhDs or PhD candidates in there. We've got one in the back. Okay. Well, she is really good at this research stuff where we learn how to analyze a certain kind of thinking and analytical thinking, starting with hypothesis breaking it down in certain steps, eventually thin slicing all the way to the question to which there is not an answer. And if you make a little progress on that, we actually give you a prize called a PhD. And that's research thinking. It's a wonderful way to go for it by analysis. And the design thinking where we build our way forward. And certainly two of not three of these cases before these other forms of thinking, which are totally valid, but not universal. You're mostly working on tame problems. Tame problems like building the Brooklyn Bridge, putting an astronaut on the moon, stabilizing cold fusion. Those are all tame problems. Tame meaning well behaved. Act tomorrow like they did yesterday. The Brooklyn Bridge does not wake up on Thursday and go, you know, it's not working for me anymore. This whole stress management thing, you know, I'm just like over it. Not doing anymore. That does not happen because the Brooklyn Bridge is a tame problem. Really hard tame problems remain to be solved, but they're tame because they behave well. Their criteria are stable. They act the same on tomorrow as they did today as they would of yesterday. Urban planters are the ones with a criteria constantly moving. You want success until you meet it. Once you get a solution, it's not reusable. This was originally conceived, the technical term wicked problem was conceived in the 70s by a bunch of Berkeley urban analysts and urban planners who were trying to think of how to invent cities. Once you've got Singapore figured out you can't just pick it up and copy it and put it in Hong Kong. It doesn't work. Stanley's true of human lives. So design thinking is really good for these messy problems and they're so messy that you know you don't know what you're doing. You know you don't know the answer and you know you can't think your way out of the problem. So you have to live into it. You have to get empirical evidence. You have to build prototypes, get experience from feedback from this really cool lab called reality in this place. None of us have ever been before called the future. We're going to try to intersect that through this incremental process of prototype iteration. That's what design does. And there are two elements to it. The process, many of you have seen this before. The five classical steps as taught here at Stanford, by the way, how many of you knew that the design program at Stanford, the 55 year old this spring program at Stanford, is the eldest interdisciplinary program at this university. David Kelly is the third generation guru of design before him, Bob McKin, before him, John Arnold, started in the 60s. And it started the way we normally start companies here in Silicon Valley. He just thought it up and printed letterhead. He couldn't get approval, so he printed letterhead. See, I had a letterhead. Now it's just a footer, you know, word. And so they thought that thing up, and we've been teaching it largely the same way for most of those years. Originally mostly referred to as human centered design, I'll come back to that and rebranded by David Kelly brilliantly about a decade ago as design thinking, because we can all think this way. People understand what the user is all about, you know, to have no point of view until you've really done the deep dive, then you define where you're coming from, you define your perspective, your point of view. In fact, even what the problem you're working on is, usually better reframing somebody having given you the wrong question. Now it's time to have a bunch of ideas, because we know what we're working on from those ideas, which ones are worth prototyping, really learning our way into the future, turn those prototypes into versions that might even be implementable, test them before you inflict them on the real world, and off you go. Then the whole implementation process starts after that, that just gets just started. Now in life design, we iterate and we make explicit something that's always true in design thinking, which is step zero. Step zero is accept. We always say you are here. For those of you who are on campus, if you go to the design loft with the design grad students hanging out, there's a great big one of those red balls that says you are here, like on a map. One of those kind of things. Just to remind our students at all times, you have to start exactly where you are. If it comes out cool, I promise you, it goes through a place that looks just like this, because you can't solve a problem you're not willing to have. Some people's problem isn't actually a problem. It's their problem with their problem. If that's your problem, that's really a problem. If you've got a problem with your problem, that's a problem. The real thing is, if you don't like your problem, you haven't got a chance of solving it well. Accept is really a big part of the deal. In addition to that, there's a set of mindsets, cultures, up to ten depending on which D-school bootcamp you're going to, but the five we tend to emphasize in life design are, first and foremost, curiosity. That's where the engine lies, where the pull is to be found long before passion, there is curiosity. Radical collaboration doesn't necessarily mean radical in the sense of extreme. It means radical in the sense of talking to lots of people, including those people who are not like you, actually trying a different channel. Reframing, looking at something entirely differently, once you've had more than one perspective, bias toward action, when in doubt do we build to think? We draw to think, we don't necessarily analyze, do think. We don't dump that entirely, but it's not the only thing we do. And be mindful of process, exactly where am I? If I'm just doing the epithetian, hold off to fudge, I'm still just learning, learning how to maintain an open mind, when I'm really executing rapidly, what am I doing? So neither head of nor behind myself. By the way, they told me your once-beenery also was allowed to talk at normal speed. Is this okay? Is this okay for you guys? Okay. Because I can turn it down, but I'd really rather not. Okay. So that's the kind of the intro, the design thinking, what's the life design thing all about? And now, because we don't have much time, and you're sitting in the cremesee's where we can't do much fun, we're going to just have a quick preview of, or fly over a five design thinking ideas as they relate to this life design stuff. Okay, number one, connect the dots. What are the dots? Who are you? What do you believe in what you do? Again, interconnect these dots, your chance of experiencing meaning-making go way up, according to the research. It's really pretty simple. Can you articulate who your value is, what's going on? And can you translate those in a meaningful way into what you're doing? Doesn't mean you have to be perfectly aligned, you have to be perfectly coherent. We call this the coherency model. But if you can articulate that, why am I doing this? I've done a lot of executive coaching with startup founders over the decades. I am very old. I'm 63. I've been doing this for 40 years. Pretty common experience, about three in the morning, somewhere along the line. Here she wakes up, runs into the bathroom, flips on the light, looks in the mirror, and the person in the mirror looks back and goes, why the hell are we doing this? And you really want to be ready for that question. You want to be ready with a good answer. And having this figured out, what we call a compass in this book we wrote, we have a life view, which is your big idea of the universe and whatever cosmology zone you think is interesting. And then your work view, your manifesto about what good work is. Actually, when we started electronic arts way longer ago, we actually wrote the manifesto before we wrote the business plan. Who are we before what we're doing? That's the thing one. Now, already that brings us to actually the last dysfunctional belief, my personal favorite, be the best version of you. Are you being your best? So are you sure this is really it? Are you sure this is it? You're not settling. Are you not selling? We wouldn't want to settle that sucks. Settling sucks. All right? Now, how many of you either believe or have heard this message, got this sense that you really should be becoming your best self, right? That's one of this strong metanarrative in the modern culture. Here's the problem. It's completely wrong. There's more than one of you. How many different ways could you possibly live? Is there only really truly one best version of you? Best implies a single criteria set that can be immutably evaluated so that one is on the same fair evaluation better than the other. In fact, best. What's better? My educator self? My startup guy self? My grandfather's. I get four grandkids. They could care less about this. It's one of the way I'd read slower. So which one's better? You can't win that argument. It's undoable. So here's the thing. In business, we often say, the good is the enemy of the better. And the better is the enemy of the best. Are you doing your best? A little half-time pitch or the post-bored meeting pitch? Let's all work six, 60 hours a week and loving it. Yeah. No, 70. OK. That sucks. I'm doing 80. All right. You know, 100 hours a week and loving it. Have you ever actually done 100 hours in a week? It's physically incredibly hard to do. I just trust all those people. I've done a lot of 80s, but 100. That's really hard. That having been said, if a best doesn't really exist, the rest of that little atherism is. And the false best is the enemy of the available better. If you have decided you have to be your best self and there isn't just one, you just decided to be unhappy for the rest of your life. I wouldn't go there. So what that leads us to is, very important question. How many lives are you? We're actually going to answer this question. Perhaps I should explain the question. It's a little rhetorical. How many lives are you? I'm starting with our experience anecdotally, but anecdotally in the thousands of all the people we've worked with and met along the way in those last 10 years, that all of us contain more aliveness than one lifetime permits us to, in fact, live. Either are more than one of you in there. Now, if that's true, you're not going to get to do everything you possibly could had to the time and the energy to so do. But now it turns out we're going to do a thinking experiment, which is called a good-donkening experiment. And imagine the following is true. Yes, it's a multiverse. We've found out now that the astrophysicists have actually proven it is truly a multiverse. There are infinite parallel universes, angstroms apart, so to speak, in some dimension we don't understand, but they're right there. And we got the wormhole thing figured out. So we have parallel consciousness, and you can actually get access to that. So, but the one really weird thing about the multiverse is you can be all over it, but you have to reserve a head. It's kind of like open table. You have to call a head. So we have to make reservations. You can be concurrently in as many life slots, occupy as many places as a human being. In as many universes as you like. You can have five. You can have 10. You think of every possible version of your life you'd like to live. Frankly, even if some of them you like a lot, you can have do overs. First time we took my youngest daughter, Lisa, to Disneyland many years ago. She thought a really good way to spend the day was to ride Dumbo 42 times. 42 times. I mean, from nine o'clock in the morning to about four in the afternoon and at about 3.30, like, how was that great? Wanna go maybe try Peter Pan? Nope. Like in Dumbo. Yeah. Okay, we're doing Dumbo. So if you want to do 42 Dumbo, you can do 42 Dumbo, that's fun. But here's the deal. You gotta call a head. I'm gonna go one, two, three, and one, I would have said four, you're gonna say a number. And that number is, how many universe slots would you like? As many as you want, you just gotta call it out. Okay? One, two, three. Oh, come on. I know you're smart educated people, but you can actually think up a number and shout it out. I'm trying to get one, two, three. Three. As eight, seven, 15. Usually there's somebody who very loudly says, one, you know, it's an ideological position I'm committed to my one true life. And I want to offer, that person's out there, I want to affirm the one people I get it. But let's say the number is on average, seven or eight. Interestingly, by the way, when I work with the group, since we're now going all over the place, heaven talks like this, the older the group gets, the higher the number goes. You think the young people have all the ideas? Not necessarily. Front row center in New York, from Constance, from the class of 1953, 87 years old, and just couldn't wait to take notes. Got a lot of life to design yet. So if you've got seven lives, come in your way. Okay, a life is not gonna happen, you only get one. So most of you isn't gonna happen. You're mostly not going to occur. You will overwhelmingly experience FOMO. Fear missing out, right? I mean, and you're smart, bright, educated, healthy people living in a targeted, rich environment, and you probably all have access to the internet and you'll just feel Google just fine. So you're gonna see a whole lot of stuff go by. That might be cool. Look, oh, there it goes. Maybe all was out, was that it? Was that it? Oh, should we have taken that? I just wanna blow at, who'd have ever had those feelings? If you have those feelings at all, you just bought into best. Like that was it, this isn't it. Who says it? They is them, pick one. You know, you're never going to know by the way. So, because of this, the way we do ideation, a step two is because you have more than one life within you, the reframe is, look, there's lots of great use, and it's never too late to get started, because it's very interesting in front of us. Let's get the Odyssey started. The Odyssey continues. Now, so it's time to actually do some design that ideation stuff, what we're so known for, ideation and prototype, or probably the two big things design is most often known for. And so idea number two is to do what we call Odyssey planning. Time to ideate your future. No, actually that's a misnomer. You can't ideate your future. You could only ideate your future, because there's more than one of you. And when we do the workshop, which we haven't got time to finish here today, or you know, do with the book instruction too, we say three, tri-three, which are limit you to merely three plans. If you want to do six, you can have two forms, that's fine. And we actually would spend, it's like 15 minutes on a single piece of paper, and think up five year plans, three different ways, three completely different versions of your future self. And there's a series of exercises we go through there. I'll give you a quick taste of what that might look like. Now you might say, wow, three versions of me. Three, really three? I'm barely coming up with one. Well, sometimes we have to help people get a template for how to come up with all three versions of themselves. You know, my guess is that's not very necessary in this room. You all don't have that problem. You know, the number of how many lives you were was pretty high. But if you needed help, our suggestion would be like this. And I actually developed in some behalf of a young MBA in a Midwestern state, I'll just say Midwestern state. Ranking school, we were having a conversation about the stuff, and he said, oh no, no, I would never want to do three. And it goes, sure you do. It goes, no, there's no way I have three ideas. I go, yes you do, watch. And I, let me demonstrate your three ideas to you. So the thing one is that thing you're already doing, just imagine the next five years goes really cool. So this is ideation, we're doing imagination. This is not project management yet. So that's great. I'll do that. Then thing two is just assume that thing you are working on died. You know, I'm currently a teacher, as a teacher, an author, and guess what, you know, it's all online now. We don't need teachers anymore. And that whole book thing, AI knows how to write better than you, please go home. So we're not doing books anymore. We're not doing, we're not doing standard teaching anymore. That's over. How many of you have lived through something going away that we don't do, used to do something that doesn't get done anymore? I've had that happen three times. Okay, so let me flip it around. How many of you hope that 10 years from now, you are doing something really interesting that you'd love to talk with us about today, but you can't because nobody's doing it? How many of you hope that you are going to find that thing you did not know you were looking for? Yeah, okay, so the whole idea is we're trying to get into a place in the future that we've never seen before. So just assume that something that you're currently doing doesn't exist and what would you do if you had to do something as you had to drop all those ideas you currently had, it reinvents yourself. What would you do? Most people can do it. And the last thing would be, and now for something completely different, if neither money, no regard or any object whatsoever, I could promise you, you'd be fine financially, maybe not wealthy, but you're fine, and they won't laugh. What would you do? So I'm having a conversation with Ellen, the young MBA, and he goes, look, this is totally boring. I don't care about this stuff because I've already got it and I'll figure it out. Really Ellen, tell me about that. Yeah, well I'm gonna go work for it. Let's call it ABC Corporation, a specialty vertical market consulting company working in the medical industry, and very, very excited about it. It's a hugely exclusive organization, and with my freshly minted MBA, I just can't wait. It's fine, I don't need anymore ideas. Quit bothering me, dead. He says, okay, ground, Ellen, that's really lovely, that's great, but guess what? I hate to tell you, but last night something very dramatic occurred. All the CEOs got together and had a conversation. And kind of went like this. So Susan, the CEO said, hey, I wanna ask everybody a question. You guys all tired of this consulting thing? I mean, how many of you like me are tired of paying these huge invoices and nothing changes? Just like really cute ideas, and then they're to go on, and there's an invoice and you're back where you started. I'm so tired of that. And all the other CEOs said, yeah, we're tired of that too. And they held hands, they sang Kumbaya together, and they said, no more consulting, no more consulting, save the money and spend it on engineering. Great, okay. So they woke up next morning, they canceled the consulting contract, the consulting industry is over, all the dilating two people are out on the street naked and terrified. So consulting is over, Ellen, what are you gonna do? He goes, what? He's on a conference call, he goes, what? I go, consulting is over. I don't think that's true. It is, Ellen, trust me, it's true. You've got five seconds and you're an unemployed MBA, it's embarrassing, come on, Ellen, come up with something. Five, four, three, go, oh, okay, okay, I'll do strategy and a large corporation doing media. Okay, so glad you had that idea, you didn't know you had, Ellen. Oh, by the way, one more thing, Ellen, that thing, you know, that thing you do, that thing you really like, pretty sure you can't make a living at it. Little embarrassed about it. What is it? Let's assume you can make a living. There's a true story, the real Ellen asked me the question on the phone in front of six other people on the conference call. Do you promise they won't laugh? I said, yes, Ellen, I promise they won't laugh. They don't even exist, so they won't trust me. And he said, I'd like to do boutique wine distribution. You know, I've told that story, but nobody ever laughs. It's all that's kind of interesting, you know, but he thought it was sort of silly. So the point being, Alan was quite convinced yet, did not have three ideas. Some of you might think you don't have three ideas, you absolutely have three ideas, you just haven't had permission to have them yet. If you've got plenty of ideas, you didn't hear any bad. Now, what does this look like when you do audacity planning this kind of like the big capstone exercise? So here's Anne, you know, and she's, you know, part way along in her very successful careers in HR, exactly thinking, maybe it's time for a change, you know, I mean, you know, in mid 30s, late 40s, whatever, somewhere in there, you know, time for a change. And so she's thinking, I want to go back and do what I, used to think about doing before I went into HR, I thought maybe I want to work with at-risk kids. I never did that. I dropped that idea back in my late teens early 20s. What if I resurrected that idea and tried that? So what would that look like? I'm just going to let myself have those ideas in about three, four minutes, she goes, well, at first I'll start a 501-C3. I'm a good organizer, I'd start getting organized. I got to raise some money, got to recruit a staff, I'm going to go pick somebody else's model for how to do this work. I'm not going to invent this from scratch, that's stupid. Let's, why, why build and you can rent, you know, and I think I want to work on reading comprehension. Reading comprehension is a big impact on students' lives if you can get at-risk kids to raise their reading comprehension early, huge impact, long-term leverage. That's where I'm going to go. So I'm going to develop that thing. I've got to start working on scaling the service, then I'm going to expand this thing over time, you know, a West Coast person, if I'm going to expand what the heck, I'm going to go to the East Coast, which is where all the big foundations are anyway, when I impress them. So that's what I'm going to do. Oh man, that's a lot of work, better not forget the family, you know, because the mom and dad are aging a little bit. Let's not forget that, you know, and eventually we had the family meeting and mom and dad made clear to all of us kids, you know, thankfully that they own interest in living with us as they age and that's good, because we didn't want them to. But nonetheless, we've got to find a place for them that they like and they're the only ones who still know the family story. We better get that thing written down before it's gone, which reminds me about writing things down. I never did that graduate work in counseling, you know, what if I went back and did some of that, maybe I should be more competent if I'm going to be actually the human services field. I'd better do that quickly because once that thing hits scaling, you know, I'm going to be so busy. So I got to get that done, speaking of being so busy, if not now, when are we going to get back to Paris? Oh my God, we got to get back to Paris, you know, because Harry and I, you know, we had our honeymoon in Paris, we promised ourselves every three years we'd come back to Paris for the rest of our lives and that hasn't happened yet. So maybe we got to get back to Paris and on the way home, stop at the Galapagos because it's going to be underwater pretty soon and I think I want to see it dry. So that would be interesting. Boy, if I pull that off, I think I'm going to write a book. Now, how do I feel about that on our day? The way we do this, we had a dashboard. We look at four dials about how you react to your own idea. What are the resources? Do you have the resources to pull off this thing? If you actually made this decision, could you do it? You know, she thinks, I'm about halfway there. I'm going to really know what I'm doing in human services and I don't have any money, but I know how to pull stuff together. Do I like it? I like it a lot. What's my confidence I could pull this off? Note confidence is the emotional reaction. Resources is the objective reaction to the same question. It doesn't mean it's the same answer. My confidence is really pretty darn high. Now, my coherence, that's that connect the dots thing. Like coherence, we mean, is this authentic to you? Is this value consistent for you? Is this who you really are? And then she would say, pretty high. Not super high. Why? She's got two problems. She's thinking deeply about, do I really want to be getting this busy again at this point in my life as my parents are aging? Do I want to double down on those two seasons of life at the same time? And the really big question is, you know, my 20-year-old self thought this was very interesting. I can't tell if I really think this is important, or I'm just nostalgic for my 20-year-old passion. I mean, because this is back to the, do I really want to do this? Or do I just like remembering I used to want to do this? It's not the same thing. She's got to test that. So that's what an Odyssey plan looks like. You do that three times, get you a bunch of ideas. And once you've got those ideas, you make a decision about which one to do, right? No, we're doing design, we're not doing engineering. So we do prototyping. The whole idea of having those ideas is to figure out which one you want to actually start investing in. So we jump into this prototype thing with a bias to action, stop thinking about it, go do stuff. And so prototyping, and first of all, there's a real big distinction between particularly late engineering prototyping in general, particularly late stage engineering prototyping and design prototyping. They're both valid, they share the word, but they mean very different things. And engineering often, our late stage prototypes are about proving the concepts as effective. That's what a beta software tester is supposed to be, that the beta version acts just like the alpha version, but with user feedback and you do that before you release to the market. That's what a beta has supposed to be. That's a late stage prototype. We're not proving anything to design. We're doing a very early stage prototype to learn something. We know we don't know what we're doing. We can't sit there and figure out how to improve this thing by drawing drawings all day long. We got to start making up some mockups and getting some feedback from some real people. I had literally, many years ago, had a huge box full of mice under my desk at Apple. All different kinds of shapes, all different kind of sizes. Why talk about it when you can just try, try, try, try. So in prototypes, we ask interesting questions. We expose our assumptions. We involve others with our ideas, which begins to actually create collaboration. And most importantly, in life design, we sneak up on the future. That thing you're wondering, maybe I'd like to try this. Somebody is living the life you're imagining already. And by prototyping it, you get into a time machine and go find people who are already in a future today that you're thinking about tomorrow. Good prototyping is cheap, fast, and teaches us something. It's really about cheap and fast. The cheaper the faster the better, as long as we learn something. Now, in life, it's not foam core and glue guns when you're doing life design. So life design prototypes are in two very simple forms, a conversation or an experience. Talk to people, do stuff. So the prototype conversation, which we call the life design interview, is essentially the same thing as an informational interview, who's the term informational interview? Or done those kind of things? Where you're asking for the story, not the job, this is the prototype conversation is a very simple thing to do. It turns out, gee, what's it really like to be? A DJ on a web channel, as opposed to on a traditional radio station. What's it really like to be involved in the private space transport industry? What's it really like to be involved in nanotechnology? What's it really like to be working on an organic farm in Siberia? You can go talk to people to have that conversation. And the reason it's an interesting conversation is because you and they, that person you want to talk to, have a very, very common base of experience and awareness and values. She thinks real life is really interesting. You think her life is really interesting. You have the same point you should get to go. It's really simple. It's like, I've done the research. You're the most interesting person in the world. You think so too. Let's get together and share that interest. Just tell me your story. And the prototype experiences means actually trying stuff on. So keeping in mind that, because something she got experience, like that woman who's made out of four different real people, she had lots of conversations with people who knew things about writing a book or about working on the nonprofit world. Do I really want to go back to grad school or not? Boy, I haven't been in school for a long, long time. We say, look, go experience. Just sit in on a class. Do start working on a paper. See whether or not the young students treat you like a leper or they think it's cool that you came back. Which she was really worried about. So just go do it. I mean, literally four or five hours of your life invested over a week's time as a piece of cake. Now, keeping in mind, all those experiences, those prototypes of conversations and experiences come from collaborating with other people. They're pretty much down to the other people, which means to find the opportunity for those interviews and those activities. You have to have idea number four, which is it's time to network. OK, I noticed there are not many MBAs in the room. So if this is probably like, oh, a lot of you are saying, finally, the networking section of the talk. I'm so glad we're going to talk about networking. It's my favorite thing. I love networking. So who are those people? Well, the network, I got one. I got two. OK, God bless you. No, most of you probably kind of feel more like this one. Woman, it's not really my thing. I don't really like this. Now we're going to kind of slide me kind of sleazy who would say that. This is not really what I do. Yeah, OK. You know, that's wrong. We need a reframe. We need a big reframe on this because all you're doing is asking for directions. Have any of you ever given someone directions? Who's ever given anybody directions? Who's done it more than once? Whoa, that's interesting. So you like it. Like three times. Three times? Whoa, you guys are repeat direction givers. OK, the success of behavior. Now I understand why there are reasons when all I'm networking is because it's sleazy and you're using people. Right? This is what I'm most often, you're using people for self-interest. The usual asking for directional help experience kind of goes like this. So I'm walking down the campus, you know, and talking about, oh, could you help me? I'm trying to find the Huang Center. Oh, do you know what it is? Now, at that moment, I go, well, I can go like, hey, who are you? I ain't make busy perth. I get a map. Try a phone. Come on. We don't usually do that. We go to go, oh, I'm just so glad to help you. And then they ask for the information. What do we do? We just tell them. We take this hard earned geographical information system, and we just dump it on them free. And what do they do? They go, oh, great. And then they leave. They just leave. Get a bottle of wine, Christmas list, card, I mean, five bucks, anything? Nothing. You got nothing. They turn. They leave. You got used. You got totally used. And you liked it. You did it again and again and again. That's diagnosable. No, it's actually, it's diagnosably human. The research demonstrates people like being helpful. When you're lost in nanotechnology,ville, and you don't know your way around, the locals will help you. When you've never been in author town, you've never been in high-end PhD research consulting city, the locals will help you out. They love their town. They think it's interesting that I understand your loss. That's the way the human community actually works. So it's really about just asking for directions. And it turns out, everybody knows a lot of people. And everybody has a lot of interests in a lot of things. So we're actually now going to do a little exercise. I want you to think about something right now, a real thing that if you could sit down with a person who really knew a lot about or had some real experience in this topic, it could be a personal interest topic, like Asian fusion cooking. It could be an extreme topic, like jumping out of airplanes, without a parachute on, just one of the bad things. Or it could be a professional interest, like, you know, what's the difference between product marketing and product management, you know, anyway. I mean, they both have an admin. I mean, what's the big deal? Whatever your question might be, that if you really could sit down with somebody who knew a lot about that and would be happy to share their experience with you, all you have to do is pay for the coffee. You go, I would totally jump into it. Now, I guess, if you're curious enough to come to this kind of a talk, it's not that easy place to sleep, then you've probably got a question like that. So think of that question. And now, when the music starts, because it's all tight, we're going to have tiny little networking parties. Of two or three people, I want you to stand up and turn and ask the people around you, hey, do you know anybody who knows anything about Asian fusion cooking? Would you be willing to give me their name? I'm going to give you three minutes to try to get a referral from the people within three feet of you to see whether or not somebody knows something about the thing you're interested in. And by the way, if you're the person being asked, and under no circumstances, does your friend, Joe, want to be connected to that? Say, I do, but I can't release his name. We're not here to violate conferences, but hey, help each other out if you can. Ready? On your feet, see if people can't help you find an interesting conversation. Do it. All right, you're done. You're done. Now. Hello. That was intentionally nowhere near enough time to make that work. And physically, this room sucks. You can't move. And half of you said I had to do standing up anyway. But did anybody actually get a hit? Actually got a connection. I might follow up on it. Great. Now, anybody actually ask and not get one. I got struck out. What do you want to know about? I want to know if anybody worked at Intuit. OK, there's a very precise question. Anybody know? Anybody had Intuit? OK, look at their face as. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. OK. Who else got scunt? Got nothing. What do you want? Does anyone know who going to like a narrator? OK, that is a loud nut to pick on you. What is your name? I got nothing personal. It's a terrible question for a Life Design interview. It's a fact. It's a piece of research. When you do a Life Design interview, you want to go into the deep end of the pool, not the shallow. When I want the story, there's no stories to who got in. It's a list. It's names. Do I know how to get in? Yes, here's the list. We're done. Do you know anybody who recently got into a white commonator and can you find out how they differentiated themselves from the other people? Because they applied three times and they finally got in. That's an interesting question. Same thing. I'll give you a break. OK. That's what you get for picking on the audience. OK, no. Yeah, what do you want? What would it be like to work at the UN in New York on global famine relief? OK, so first of all, global policy involvement, UN or famine foods? I got a UN. I got famine food stuff right here. OK, now what am I demonstrating? What I'm demonstrating is I've done this literally. I've done this thousands of times. I have never ever, ever had someone raise their hand and ask a question to which nobody in the room could help. I did it once with 12, 6 grade boys from a private school in Tokyo. They asked me to do this thing and I went, there's no way. They're 12. They don't know anybody. They live in a culture where they're highly cloistered and they're not allowed to go outdoors much or talk to anybody. And they did fun. They all typed. And the point being, the resources are all there for you. You just have to ask. But you do have to ask. For those of you who are not wired this way, that introversion is the way you drop it out of the room. That's fine. I mean, it's convenient to be an extrovert today as it turns out in some ways. In other ways, not so much. I recognize this is hard for a lot of people. If there was a better way to do it, I would let you know. But I'm not aware. LinkedIn makes this so much easier because you can do it remotely. The world is pre-organized around being willing to talk to each other, but go for the story and after the job. Now, last idea really quickly is choosing well. I'm going to fly through this to leave some Q and A time. Because the problem is, how do you know and you know? I mean, no matter what design we do, it all ends up with the choice. It all ends up with a decision. And that's the hard part. Did I really do the right thing? Is this really what I want? That's a really hard thing to do. And this is where mindfulness of process comes into play and you want a good choosing process. So the four-step choosing process that we've developed, pretty much just standing on the shoulders of the world of positive psychology. This is not our original work. But again, it's human centered design, fully understanding the whole human person. This is part of life reality. So you gather and create options. This place is great at that. Then you get a narrow and down-to-manage of a list. Then you get to do the hard thing and make a choice. And then of course, agonize whether or not you blew it. No, let's not do that. Let's go the options we don't choose and move on. So I'll briefly touch each of these. I mean, you're going to go really fast. Gathering, you know how to do that. Narrow down. Anybody ever feel like a little overwhelmed with choice? Yeah, interesting. So you got that feeling why? Because you don't know how much it would jam to buy. The research shows we gok into some whole food store somewhere, put six jams on the designer table. There's six jams available today. Everybody's walking by. Do you think many people stop and look? And not too many. A lot of people, not to a lot of people. A lot. About 40%. Not quite half. Of those, how many people actually buy one? A third. No, one in three. Not bad. OK, try again a couple of weeks later. Same store, same provider, 24 jams. Now, more people stop fewer. More? Fure. Right. 50% more. We love options. Ooh, look at all the jam. Oh my god. Look at all the jam. How many people buy? New body. Can't deal with it. Why? Your brain freezes at four to six. You find yourself standing in front of an option list with seven to 12. How many options do you really have? None. What do you do? Cross them off. You have to make your list manageable. Then you got to choose Dan D. Sian Goldman, who's clippable. We will not watch it, given you a no time, that the wisdom of the emotions is a real thing. So Dan Goldman, the original author of the book, emotional intelligence, mostly aggregating other people's work. He's still working on this EQEI stuff. Identifies neuroscientifically now, neurophysiological. This is how many brain people have gotten their own. We've got Tina Steele, the PhD neuroscientist, a bunch of brain stuff going on. It's really a fascinating time to be alive. We know a lot about the soft stuff. Now, it turns out we know a lot of hard stuff about soft stuff. The way your brain works. And the way your brain works is there is what he calls the wisdom of the emotions or the wisdom center actually located in the basal ganglia of your brain, the ancient brain, where in fact all the data on what worked for you and what did not is stored, that valences your decision making. You think it's self-evidently objective, true, truth that causes you to make a decision? Because clearly bigger is better, right? Because you want a bigger tumor, not a smaller tumor. No, that's not true. The bigger is not, I was better at the pens. Bigger is good in IPO and it's bad in tumor is actually an emotional valence on something who has to decide that cancer is a bad thing. Now, that comes from the basal ganglia, which, as it turns out, has no connectivity whatsoever to the verbal center of the brain, the verbal cortex, has high connectivity to the limbic system, your emotions, and your intestines. So the gut feeling is a real thing. Learning how to understand your emotional intelligence, which is a very, very important sophisticated part of you, is a critical aspect of good decision making. Do not confuse inarticulate with unsophisticated. This part of your consciousness is fabulously sophisticated, but it's more like Hawaiian. It uses fewer letters. So you have to learn how to speak it to language. Now, lastly, let go and move on. I'll just claim what Dan Gilbert, a buddy over at Harvard, works on, turns out the research shows if you want to be happy, the happiness engineers. Turns out the best way to be happy is not getting what you want. It's wanting what you've got. The reversible condition is not conducive to the synthesis of sustainable happiness, Dan would say. I won't detail you the research, but it shows that when somebody makes a decision, and either themselves concludes or is told it's irreversible, and other people are making the exact same decision, like what to buy or what to take home, and can reverse the decision, even if they don't, those people end up unhappier with the exact same outcome as these people who got it irreversibly. You're willingness to own your decision and not be distracted by the other possibilities. There's a huge impact on the quality of the decision long term. So it turns out actually it's harder than you thought. You don't just have to make a great decision. You have to make a great decision well. A fair decision made well, meaning energetically implemented, letting go the options and moving on, not getting stuck in reviewing regret. A fair decision implemented well beats a great decision made badly, and that keep your options open thing is actually a disaster as a long term strategy. It's great on the front end. It's terrible in the back end. So set yourself up to win by understanding your decision making process and employing not just cognitive knowing, but emotional knowing as well. So connect the dots, understand how your work view and life you inform your coherence, have more than one version of the future of your life to pick from, prototype it, don't just analyze it. Ask for directions, people are willing to help you, and make a good choice. So we're about done. So we've had this new experience now as authors, and a bunch of people are reading the book. We were really reticent to write the book, because we're used to having conversation, not just dropping a tone and running away, and would it work or not. And what people have been telling us is that they're finding this experience of the workshop of the book as actionable and hopeful. And the reason I mentioned this is that's helpful, big to us, because it's all about doing stuff. Set the bar low, clear it by taking actionable steps, and that doability leaves people hopeful. An awful lot of encouragement is to clear this amazing bar, be your incredible Olympic gold self 24 by seven. And frankly, it's just not doable. So, cut yourself some slack. Set the bar low, clear it, do it again, do it again, do it again, it'll feel better. And by the way, it actually works. And why trust this guy? Well, because, first of all, you're not the guinea pig, thousands of people have been experimented on before you. And then the researchers came in, because at Stanford, you're actually supposed to talk about stuff that's true, not just make it up. And so, two graduate school of education analyses were done on the, as they would call it, the efficacy of the intervention of our model. Sounds kind of like a proctology visit. But nonetheless, the analysis came out that sure enough, this stuff really does work. And it actually is, the first time we've applied human centered design to the surprisingly human problem and what to do with the rest of your life. It's centered in the Stanford design program. So, the whole point is, we're trying to be a little more human, which might be a little more helpful and lead people a little more helpful. So, have you got any questions? Okay. And there's no might, I'll listen and then I'll shout it out. What do you got? So, my, my, my. Hi. It was really fascinating. As you were talking, I felt like I would make a lot of connections with these various pro tips you can give to how relationships or effective relationships operate. Specifically talking about romantic relationships. So, I was wondering, how often does that happen where you find, like, do you ever see people trying to apply this type of methodology to how they... Every desire your life. Okay. Yeah. No, we don't, we don't have therapy. And we don't do love. But we've heard back from a whole lot of couples who are doing this stuff together. And happily so, if you do that as a collaboration, not a negotiation, like here's my fantasy plan, mind when's your loses? You know, okay, that is not helpful. And get it, you know, the steps getting in terms of getting clear and experimenting, yeah, like, you know, rather than sit there and talk, you know, for 14 hours on the, you know, the DTR conversation, the define the relationship of conversation. You know, like, maybe let go do stuff. So that might be helpful. So I think there are things you can get from there, but I don't pretend to be a romance specialist by a long show. Other questions? What is? What are your alternative plans? What are my alternative plans? That's a very interesting question. I actually am intentionally disobeying my own rule right now. So again, the exception proves the rule. Because I totally committed to this book there. I've dragged my feet viciously for two years. Bill, no, don't make me write a book. I don't do it. It's stupid. There are 400,000 books released a year. Half of them talk about what you should do with your love. You know, like, even if we're right, nobody will know. It'll get lost in the noise. It's a waste of time. Forget it. I much rather talk to people. Why write a book? So I pulled that off for two years, and it was beaten with sticks, and forced to write a book. And so I said, we're going to write the book or you're going to give the book, you know, a decent thing. I'm also trying to set up my lab at Stanford with five people working full time to do this work, to run in my absence, because I don't want to do this forever. Because I do want to have some audacity planning later. And so I am intentionally not thinking about my future at all. I am totally sold out to only two things. I am letting this book be as successful as it deserves to be so it can help, who can help. And I'm setting my lab up to be able to run without me. And if I think about anything other than that, I just stop it. So I refuse to answer your question. Because I'm designing my life. I'm in a season where I'm not ideating. Yeah. How do you handle things being here? How do I feel here? Great. I'm really, really good at failing. I'm fabulous at failing. So prototyping is all about failing. We often say fail early to succeed sooner. Now, there really are two kinds of failure. That's why I set the bar low. Try it a little bit. Try it a little bit. Try it a little bit. Go out and see whether or not something works for you. And plan on failing at it, because you know you don't know what you're doing. That's the failure design of the prototype iteration process. Let's distinguish that from. And then we finally committed, and we got in the rocket, and we went to the moon, and we died. OK. Now, that's failing. All right. That's real failure. So real bonafide. I bet everything on it. I finally made the commitment, and it failed. It is hugely painful. It doesn't mean your life is over. It doesn't mean you're a bad person. You can do everything right, and it still doesn't work. When you blow it, do you notice the first question for most of the times that happens to you is what I do wrong? As soon as something doesn't work out, do you think what I do wrong? It's the most normal thing to think, particularly if you're bright. What does it mean? It means had I done everything right, it would have worked. That's not true. You don't have anywhere near enough control of the universe. It's that to be true. So you have to decide when you fail what it really means. There's a section we talk about failure. Is it just a minor thing? Is it a learning situation? Was it just a goof up? I forgot to tie my shoes or a trip. You have to evaluate your serious failures in an honest way. And a relatively small percentage of them have high learning value, and some are just mistakes, and forgive yourself and move on. But you want to be smart about failure, because the pain of it is real, and let's not have more of it than we need. Let me take a minute, you want it two more? Yes, right there. I have trouble letting go and moving on with this. Yes. Are there any active steps that you can take to do that? Hard to let go and move on. Really hard. And Dan Gilbert's research is pretty compelling. And the problem, even in the experiment they put together, of course, the forcing somebody to let go was externalized. Applying that insight in a meaningful way is done on options. You know darn well, aren't dead yet. So I had these four options. I could have done the Teach for America thing. I could have gotten the MBA, or I could have taken that startup job. And I'm doing startup thing. And the second round of funding didn't come in. We're all working for beans and weenies now. And we did, oh, God, did I really blow it? You know, it's really a lot tougher than that. I thought it was wonderful. They said they told me to STVP. It's just fabulous to be an entrepreneur. And now it's really hard. And my girlfriend left me, and what am I doing? And I smell bad and I'm broke and holy shit. It was not in the brochure. And you're having that experience. Now let go and move on. Yeah, thank you for sharing. The reality is it's a mental discipline. And so I think it's not that you can ever have let go. It's that you get good at doing it. So the thought comes in. Should I see a FA? Thanks for sharing. I understand that it was. It was, in fact, the best decision available at the time. Thank you, and move on. So I think the best way to handle let go and move on is when that sneaky little thought comes back, I'm going to want to beat you up for having done the wrong thing, you think it for its insight and you keep going. But don't judge. The old heiferism, you cannot prevent the birds from flying over your head and the birds meaning thoughts that are going to beat you up. But you don't have to let them invest in your hair. So I would apply that to this let go thing. Maybe one. Yeah. What makes up hard with the circle that you were talking about is that when folks are in power, they're more likely to feel like they're authentic. These are always because they have an ability to attain exactly what they're looking for. It's very hard to tell this power is our good power. So if I have more power or authority, do I have a better chance at being a coherent person? Can I align who I am, my values, and so on? No. No, I think sure I answer no. You have some degrees of freedom, but all positions of power come with tremendous amounts of constraint because you have power over something. And that thing is a thing. If it's a company, then it's got a certain value proposition and it's not going to wake up and turn into something entirely different tomorrow. And so you're surprisingly bound in. Now, if what you want to adjust is within the domain of what's called domain sovereignty, what you want to play with is within your power domain, then you've got some tools. You've got some flexibility. But very often those issues of coherence and authenticity and value fulfillment operate outside of that. So it's not power is more coherent and less power is less coherent. It's whether or not those elements you're trying to integrate who I am, what I believe what I'm doing, are intention or not. And that alignment in the other self is not really power based, not power sensitive, how would I do? I know power elists people who do great and powerful people who really are banging their head against concrete. Yeah. I didn't mitigate the risk or quantify risk in your agreement. I didn't quantify risk. We do not deal with risk at all. You may have noticed. That's why the question was asked. There are a bunch of things that we don't cover. This is not a comprehensive life design system. We think it's a sufficient one. We built it. But for instance, it doesn't bring up character questions. It doesn't bring up foibles. You've got the dark side you've got to work through. It doesn't deal with your mother's voice in your head at all. And on the risk side, that is an important criteria. So I have to manage the risk of either my prototype, I have to manage the risk of the plan I'm playing with. But how I decide what to do with that risk is entirely up to you. Now, design might want to help you work that through. Certainly by prototyping it. One of our favorite examples is a bright executive woman who really wanted to jump out of the airplane and go become a restaurant tour. Totally something different. And she's a very successful person. So she went for it. She had a passion. She went for it. She bought a restaurant. Took all the assets. bought this thing. Totally remodeled it. Turn it into a deli with a Tuscan restaurant at the same time. Open to great fanfare. It was hugely successful. Yay! Hit it at it. Turns out, thinking about a restaurant and running on a totally different. So she could have mitigated the risk of having missed that whole thing by trying a little catering. You don't like you just shut it down over the weekend. Maybe work in somebody else's restaurant for a while and see whether or not the brilliant bubbling conversation of her fine Tuscan food and keyante that she imagined people would be having wasn't just arguing about who should be doing the house chores, which is mostly what they've talked about. So she could have mitigated risk through that experimentation process. But ultimately the decision you make, and so now we have decided to go and try to teach llamas to dance in Afghanistan is a pretty risky play. So that's not a big opportunity. We want to do that. That risk is inherent. So you have to decide what risk you're taking and what risks you want to manage, what risks you want to enjoy. Design can help you qualify the risk, but not necessarily eliminated. Risks are never eliminated. They're just managed. Are we done? Thanks for coming. APPLAUSE Thanks. That's it. Thanks.
