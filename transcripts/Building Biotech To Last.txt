 Who you are defines how you built. This is the OddPattern thought-leaders series brought to you by Stanford E-Corner. Welcome YouTube and the Stanford community. So great to have all of you here, whether you're in the Stanford community or in our YouTube community. It's great to see you virtually. I am Ravi Balani, a lecturer in the Management Science and Engineering Department at Stanford and the director of Alchemist and accelerator for enterprise startups. As you know by now, the entrepreneurial thought-leaders seminar is brought to you by STVP, the Stanford Engineering Entrepreneurship Center and BASIS, the Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students. Today, it is a special day at ETL because we have one of our alums and one of the great supporters of the Stanford community. We're thrilled and delighted to welcome both Trevor Martin and Hershey Park to ETL. Dr Trevor Martin, I should say, is the CEO and co-founder of mammoth biosciences, which is building the most diverse toolbox for using CRISPR technology. For those that aren't familiar with CRISPR, CRISPR allows you to exquisitely edit DNA with the sensitivity and a precision that's really unprecedented. It's a new technology, the Nobel Prize, which was awarded for the research on the potential of CRISPR, was given for research that was really just done 10 years ago. It is one of these technologies that's widely viewed as one of these non-linear disruptive moments in scientific innovation that's going to usher in a ton of profound deep and broad innovations to come. The mammoth is building an application development platform for CRISPR. As the name suggests, their goals aren't modest. Mammoth is addressing challenges across healthcare, agriculture, environmental monitoring, bio-defense, and more through the discovery of novel CRISPR systems to power the next generation of CRISPR-based synthetic biology products. These areas of focus include a novel class of affordable, effective and rapid CRISPR-enabled molecular diagnostics that allow individuals in the worldwide to better understand their health and a novel family of CRISPR proteins that can enable in vivo genome editing. The CEPO is the co-founder and the southern boy having grown up in Georgia with the love of math and physics. He fell in love with biology at Princeton where he got his bachelor's degree in 2011 and then went on to the farm to stand for here where he got his PhD in bio in 2016 and he was part of the Fraser lab in the bio department. His scientific work has been featured in outlets including 538 and the Atlantic. He's the featured healthcare on our area on the Forbes 30 under 30 lists. I think now he's Forbes 40 under 40. He's also on the Fortune 40 under 40 list. Are you 31 now Trevor? He's also an E&Y entrepreneur of the year for 2021 so please virtually welcome Trevor. We also have with us for Sheet or Sheet is a partner at the venture capital firm Mayfield who led Mayfield's investment into mammoth or Sheet is one of those rare VCs that straddle worlds that other VCs are too scared to. So, Ersheet co-leaves the human and planetary health investment practice and invests in cloud infrastructure and cybersecurity and prior to Mayfield. Ersheet had a career as a proven repeat entrepreneur and executive at Cisco and Microsoft. He was the co-founder and CEO of Store Simple, which is a leading cloud integrated storage company that was acquired by Microsoft in 2012. Ersheet is another example of how the US has been the beneficiary of amazing talent reared in India. He holds a bachelor's degree in computer science from IIT Mumbai, the Indian Institute of Technology in Mumbai, where he received the young alumni achievement award in 2015 and he also holds an MBA from the Wharton School and is passionate about accelerating healthcare innovation and transforming college education. So everybody please give a virtual welcome to Trevor and her sheet Trevor and her sheet welcome. Thanks Trevor, I just wanted to open an floor to you if there is anything you want to add or share with the community that about mammoth or any other messages that you want to relay before we go into the directed fire side chat. Sure, yeah, no, it's a great introduction. Thanks, it's definitely comprehensive. So yeah, the only thing I would add just to kind of put context around it is to your point like Christopher kind of came on the scene, let's say like 10 years ago. Some of the seminal papers they came out of our co founder Jennifer Dalton slap for example, and at mammoth. I think what's exciting is we're able to build on all this kind of foundational work that's been done using what we call the legacy crisper technologies things like Cas9 or cast 12. And the point of mammoth is to build out this new portfolio of new systems new technologies to really deliver on what we see as the promise of crisper. And it goes to the things you mentioned where one of the things that makes mammoth unique is that we see that promise broadly across both detecting and curing disease. And within each of these areas, we have kind of a North star. So on the curing disease aside, it's all about permanent cures for genetic disease and this idea of what if you could get a one time injection. And they would actually mean that you never get never need to get treated for that disease for the rest of your life. That would obviously be transformative for patients lives. And then on the diagnostic side is this idea that we've been able to develop this the world's first new method of molecular detection. I don't know how many years basically leveraging this crisper technology with the kind of sensitivity and specificity of PCR sequencing. And with this very simple chemistry that means that it can be pushed in a decentralized manner closer and closer to the patient, whether that's the doctor's office or the home. And what's exciting is that it is this kind of platform technology. So I mean, you listed out some of the areas, right? There's like, you know, there are pedics diagnostics by manufacturing agrarian or soul sorts of areas. And that's the kind of the blessing and the curse of a platform technology is that there are these like so many exciting things we can do. So you have to think really critically about like where do we go, where do we go with partners, how do we enable others, how do we like protect things for ourselves to preserve value. And yeah, I think we'll get into many of those things today. Yeah, I want to jump into that. So that's fantastic. Or she, do you want before I dive into what Trevor saying, can you educate those that aren't familiar with biotech investing? Why my method? What happens with the typical biotech startup and why mammoth is different if Trevor already didn't already capture that. Sure. So, you know, the if you kind of look at the arc of the innovation ecosystem in the 70s and 80s, right, investment in tech and life sciences was very similar. You know, investing, minting tech, often meant doing hardware software, a lot of engineering that kind of then have to be brought into products that came to market and you scaled up revenues and then you went public or to taxes. And that often took 710 years and there was also the case with what was happening in life sciences. Then in the late 80s, early 90s with the advent of the internet, it became pretty easy to write software, you know, more electrons on the PC, more electrons across the internet and it started transforming returns for sort of venture capital forms on the tech side of the house. And so a lot of life science investing ended up becoming a very specialist thing where firms then focused on sort of creating assets for other large form companies to buy. And a lot of biotech investing often works like that. So there's a lot of forms in life sciences investing that will basically be a portfolio of 20 or 30 kind of individual sort of treatment investments. And the goal in those is less to build a standalone company and more to focus on creating enough data to make it credible such that a large company goes and acquires that. Now, crisper as it happened in 2012, the first few companies that started out with crisper sort of did take a mainframe approach to innovating with crisper their view was so crisper at the core is a fundamental bioengineering technology. We look at the methods like the Intel or Microsoft or the bioengineering. And so in the classic tech parlance when you have a platform technology, you have to build some applications to show the power of the platform, but then you have to get an e-proclude an ecosystem that can build all the applications to kind of truly realize the value of the platform. And so the first few companies that started out in 2012 took the first risk of quoting and basically you know kept on fighting among each other on who owned it, but focused on doing everything on their own kind of like almost like the way in the mainframe land. People built their hardware, you know, their chips, their operating system before they build the application with mammoth the view was that we had the core engine that was finding crisper systems and the odds that you know the first was the best and the only one was pretty low. So the fact that this approach could then you know powered with high throughput screening AI and a lot of biology could find new crisper system for different applications. It was something that became core to the company and then it was sort of used to bring new applications like diagnostics, which nobody had done before in addition to therapeutics and bio manufacturing. And so the core then as a company is your culture is very different, you do have a mission to market so the core mission at mammoth that aligned everyone was you know this impact and save as many lives as quickly as possible, which meant that even though diagnostics doesn't look very profitable from a return on investment perspective, we were not not going to go to that. And we were going to go and do things, but we were also going to go and partner along on that journey and in that sense, then it meant that you had to sort of think about, you know, not you're a true built to last mindset you have to think about what is the business model product often in biotech companies, you know, scientists will think about revenue as bad. Here it was the other way around, right, which is if we had to be in business to build a big company, we had to sort of go and start thinking about revenue already on and mammoth is one of those companies, which actually has done really well with revenue and it's earlier earlier so this starts giving you a flavor of sort of how you know this is designed from the ground up. You also want to have a line stakeholders right because you don't want an investors looking for a three to five or exit when you've tried to build a ten year company so there's a range of things like that that going to it. And if we don't get the foundation right it's impossible to retrofit it so much good stuff so I want to really dive in to get really practicalities for all the founders that want to go long like mammoth is so really thinking big and thinking about practical tactics on how do you actually orchestrate a startup if the goal is to be a big company. So I want to go ahead and start with the goal is to build this long term platform and I think many of these learnings are going to be also relevant even if you're not in bio for all the other founders because I think a classic thing is to think about where to start and when you're building a platform you're oftentimes cascading focus areas that will ultimately become the platform but you need to decide where you're starting initially and as or sheet alluded to and also Trevor mentioned there are this there is sort of a bifocal model here but one of the early markets is the cost of the market and I want to use this as a case study because it's a counterintuitive market to go into and what I'd like to do is the intention here is is that founders oftentimes grapple with which market to focus on first and you can use a bunch of dimensions you can look at market size you can look at willingness to pay you can look at tech differentiation and I want to abstract from you guys the general learnings that might also be relevant for everybody so given that can you first explain why diagnostics for the market is not going to be a big company. So I think that's why diagnostics for those that aren't familiar with bio causes an allergic reaction to many VCs when they hear that that's what you're doing and then to the process by which you decided which market to focus in on early and if there was a framework that is extensible for others either of you can take it. So I guess going to the first part of your question around prioritizing the market I think it is really important because that is like the blessing the course of a platform company is like you can do everything but obviously like you'll fail if you and that's like a classic like and I know I probably had to learn myself like a seed kind of issue is that you have this like big vision of like oh it's a platform and like it can do anything but if you don't have like a good story around like what are some specific markets that like it's really compelling for them that can be really challenging. To like have a compelling story about like okay like why is this exciting and investable and I think just to start off I think people maybe over index a little bit on like oh like when you're doing your seed ground like this market that you said in the deck is like the exact market you're going to go after like 10 years from now I think what was more helpful to me at every stage of the company was the thought process that you went into when you're selecting that and you might pivot the exact market as you develop the technology and you move along but what's important is you have that thought process of like going to market. And like understanding like okay like what are the advantages we have like where can we not go because maybe we don't actually out compete so it's more of like a philosophy of like in some sense it matters less what you choose and it's more that you have a mentality of choosing and like iterating on that and like making sure that you're always thinking about okay like I have a cool technology platform but where is it headed and like having that product mindset that can be like a really big trap. I think it's just like staying on the technology and then just assuming that like a people partner like you know. So I think that's the high level so then once you do that like you can stackering things however you want there's like market size there's like time to market I think something that's under appreciated there. Is this idea of kind of the proof points like regardless of market size even is like maybe something you want to optimize for is just progress and like showing that the technology works and maybe you do that with a market that's frankly like not commercializable in many ways and you know hopefully it is and like you work something out but. Maybe you're actually just optimizing for a hey this CRISPR works and it is something that's efficacious and it like is safe in humans and even if that's on some tiny disease that maybe wouldn't be a very commercially profitable that could be huge in terms of like funding the company for the long term and like getting partners excited about targets you do care about. And for technical reasons that small market might be way easier to achieve this technical milestones so I don't like it people sometimes see that as like a dirty word like oh like it's not the right market size or something but I think that's something I've definitely come to appreciate is that there's many other factors that just because it's not like business school like oh like the right market or something doesn't mean that it's not the right thing to go after and you have to just really understand like the market dynamics of like the industry you're in. What are investors looking for if you're trying to build a long term company you're going to need to raise a lot of money so you need to understand like who your customer what your customers want and one of your huge customers or v seats. Because otherwise like yeah you might have chosen the right huge market but you just die because you don't reach the right proof points and you know unfortunately the technology doesn't reach its full potential. So I don't know if there's just some initial thoughts that have. So so if I could add right both in terms of the answer to that question as well as along the points that what Trevor mentioned what I think mammoth and Trevor in on Trevor's leadership did right right so I think the first is you can do like one of the ski point is you can do a platform company but that can mean anything to anything you can do 10 things but you all to do it one them one at a time. And so it's very important and so culturally the company has a very strong sort of mindset on goals and accountability and what is the focus for a given quarter and if somebody is going to change from that plan right having a you know just being very you know driven about it right there on OKRs and and it's not that everyone scores 100% it kind of scores at like 70% you have to be intellectually honest often when you have very strong sort of academic mindset people are not used to sort of going ahead and acknowledging that something was 70% but. In a start of you have to have straight stuff so if everything's 100% you probably not aiming kind of high enough and for those that don't know OKRs or goals basically goals objectives and results okay so one is that and then to the specific question about you know when you're trying to build a company for the long haul you're trying to manage risk so when you have a big technology or a step change technology you want to prove it out with different steps along the. And sometimes what happens is when people are thinking I want to just like you know there's the hand that lays the goal the neck I just want to hand I want a big market you can take on too much technical risk and that can be the undoing of the company versus some other things that Trevor and team are really mindful about is how do you kind of go and break these big problems into smaller things focus on what you do very well as a core how do you find partners to do a bunch of the other stuff do the step wise building block to show and then when moments come they show agility right like during gold. So when it became one of the first like in 40 years it was like since BC are crisper diagnostics is the biggest advancing diagnostics and it went from concept to you know FDA E ways faster than then pretty much are you know the same speed as the mRNA vaccines kind of thing and so then you know but they were conscious about it they were going to go prioritize that what would you not going to do and why they were going to do things or if they pick narrow disease area how do they prove the platform out how do they prove their differentiators out. So that's a lot of that kind of stuff that is at the core to the strategy there's one of the questions in the chat on how is like doing a software company different from a deep tech company like this software is very easy to iterate and pivot in these things any moving atoms businesses especially if they're regulated is often much harder. And so you have to be more deliberate and more thoughtful about what you're going to spend on like the planning phase is very very important and often there's a tendency that hey we got the money. It's these days I it feels that in the Stanford ecosystems it's easier to get money to start a company then to actually go through an interview for a job where somebody will have to you know ask you like 15 to 15 different interviews and questions and things like that. And and but then once the money is there what do you do with it that planning phase and strategy phases very very important for anything which is a moving atoms business because you want to kind of from an investor perspective throughout the product the business model and a lot of the a lot of the other things like proving out the business model. Actually can happen much faster than actually building the product and will cost a lot less and will make you much more attractive to investors. I just want to unpack this because there's a lot and I think this is really gets to the heart of where the where the rubber hits the road for most founders is a couple key take away game for choosing the market. First this Trevor said is make a choice so one of the kid kid football is just doing too much. My wrong choice is not choosing in many ways. You know the worst decision is in decision gang so choose. And then what should guide the decision is not necessarily market size because it's for it sounds like in mammoth's case a lot of the decision was driven by your technical differentiation. So these guys glossed over the points that I just want to make sure that you understand is that with Christopher there's the key technical differentiation on diagnostics is there's high sensitivity and it's really cheap, you know relative to what's already happened before in the past. And so then they mapped that to a market to go after which is diagnostics and diagnostics may seem like a small market that for a variety of reasons doesn't make money for investors. And then there's a false notion because with Christopher it actually expands what the market size potential convene so the focus on proving out and developing the technology is what allows you to layer the tech development towards the platform and your simultaneously expanding the market to a new market that is historically misguided if you're looking in your rear view mirror on market size. So Christopher, was there any other tactical or unintuitive insights Trevor on the framework you use to decide on the initial focus area. Well, I think there's a lot that you have to think there in terms of like company narrative as well. So from the very beginning of the company we've been working on both therapeutics and diagnostics. I think for most of the companies lifetime we've you know been known mostly for diagnostics, but that's not because we haven't had the ambition to build therapies or like been working on it's more you have to understand like what do they keep proof points that like you know make that. Something that you want to share with the world and like how do you want to like sequence that time and obviously the pandemic really highlighted diagnostics in ways that you know the last century hasn't had the opportunities for and it was a really great opportunity for us to like step up to the plate and get the world's first. High throughput emergency use authorization for Christopher based covid test so it's just a testament to the power of the technology. But in general, I think there. You know most companies would have just said okay like we'll just talk about you know therapeutics from the beginning, but to her sheets point I think the what's interesting is if you're thinking about other things aside from just like market sizing which diagnostics whenever compared to therapeutics in terms of market sizing but you're thinking about like time to market and. What's the places where you can really move quickly and like really you know be able to generate even revenues like substantially sooner than like therapeutics for example that's where you can start to think more creatively and you can say okay. Like actually having therapeutics and diagnostics together is extremely exciting for a variety of reasons a because it leverages the same technology but be it's actually kind of uncorrelated business models in a way of like diagnostics is regular recurring revenue like quarter of recorder. Whereas therapeutics is you know nothing for many years and then you kind of have a zero to one event and billions of dollars of revenue so. Something that's interesting and like a down market for example are a dislocated like market like we're in is that for therapeutics only companies because they're kind of driven by these data readouts on the path to their hopeful approval. You'll see actually on even good data readouts there stock will go down because people sell into it because they know there's six months for the next readout and there's not going to be any news in between and they can just rotate in and out of it as they please on that journey. Whereas if you have multiple uncorrelated business models not just therapeutics diagnostics like agriculture by manufacturing that means that you actually have all this news flow and you know you really have to be along for the ride and a long term investor or else you're just going to miss the bit and you can't kind of rotate in and out like oh like I know they're next clinical reading. And it's like a lot more kind of thinking around how you're structuring the company for the long term. But yeah I think that's it's just depending on how you're trying to build out the company itself. So if you look at the diagnostics value chain the testing companies like your lab corporate quest or like a Stanford lab is not a very venture return business model the individual test themselves. It's not that big right like the biggest exits that that have happened around that have been like $10 billion kind of companies like real. But if you look at the picks and shovels that power the whole diagnostics ecosystem this is where you have companies like thermo official aluminum and a agile and that is like close to half a trillion dollars a market gap that is sitting in becoming the picks and shovels and so when you are kind of one of those more fundamental technologies. Yes, you have to kind of go ahead and create a test which is in the second category to show it works, but then you can power the whole ecosystem and when with CRISPR diagnostics it would be true molecular sort of RNA DNA detection happening you know at point okay at home. We're just unprecedented specificity and so so the point is that yes you're doing this test but it's really a proof point on the platform and then you are going ahead and any other sort of go build out build out with that platform. So it's also important to articulate that story well because you know a lot of investors will often have a DDA and you know they may just zero in on this one thing and not going to get the get the whole thing and and anyway so that that that that kind of is is a full time job right I think a deep tech company really needs a CEO who has to sort of really focus on storytelling strategy fundraising. You know big deals and kind of exact recruiting right they if they are focused on their science and building the product then they're not being the CEO for the company and to Trevor is kind of credit right he took that leap. Despite his PhD despite his technical background and then surrounded himself with a lot of amazing advisors to actually become really good at the CEO job. You know you can't sort of be a part time CEO if you're going to build a world changing company and so he did then go see sought out amazing co founders who are the best people in each of those technical areas to kind of be his founders you know one of them later ended up winning the Nobel Prize a few years later. So so those were sort of these these kind of things that I felt that you know these are the things that Trevor and team do really well and I think let's let's dive into that because we have this discussion on near term the short term lens on the market opportunity and then the one point that are sheet brought up us at the beginning was that you also have to set it up for long term success at the beginning and we're already covering some of those topics but I want to invite Trevor and her sheet to comment about how do you make sure there's alignment between investors and founders from the beginning. To prevent mistakes can that can stand in the way of realizing the company's mission, especially because oftentimes we're seeing long term missions that will get compromised by short term optimizations or ethics are compromised in the process of achieving your long term goals and especially with mammoth there are significant ethical repercussions of how the technology can be used for good or bad. Trevor or sheet can you comment on how investors and founders can be aligned or considerations at the beginning to align for long term success. Yeah I can kick off yeah I mean just like you know when I'm sure when well may feel to especially in her sheet when they're looking at you know founders they're looking at people right you the founders should be doing the same the other direction like because it is a long journey right it's like hopefully like a 10 plus year timeline so. Whatever you're talking about at that time like the tactical part is probably going to be completely different like even maybe a year later so like you you want to make sure you know you are having a good conversation but the more to the point I think what I always look for is the conversation itself and like do you like talking to each other and like even if you disagree like is it feel like you're learning and like you're moving forward and like fundamentally just do like respect each other mutually because there's going to be times you agree that you're going to be able to do that. So if you're going to be times you agree there's going to be times you disagree if you just always agree that's probably not a good sign either right because like clearly like you never just agree on everything so I think it's more like looking for someone that can be like a true thought partner and that as the company is growing like you can both really yeah just like be really in sync in terms of. So all the VCs are going to say that worth a year to change the world and we want to be your best friend to come to when you have a discussion it's a common narrative so if you have multiple how do you actually know who's actually been time in my opinion and honestly that's one of the biggest skills you have to develop as a founder I think is that intuition whether you're hiring or you're like finding investors being able to like see if you have values alignment right because if you hire someone you don't have values alignment either like you're going to end up in similar problems so. But but once you sign the term sheet you're sort of wedded you can't get rid of the investor so how do you know if your values are not binding but yeah the definitive agree sorry okay so so it's fair enough but but how do you know if your values are aligned if it takes time to figure that out yeah so there's the conversations been then I think other things that are really helpful is just looking at like other entrepreneurs they've worked with and like one of the types of companies they invest in and like you know that speaks for itself and it doesn't even have to be the same industry but it's just like are they building things that tend to you know get sold in a couple years are they building things that. Our IPO and like you know really trying to build something that's a generational I'm going to change the world and you know talking to entrepreneurs that have worked with investors very similar to how you know you get diligence to yourself as a founder so I mean all those things that are just going into that funnel of like is this person someone that I'm like values aligned with and whether we agree or disagree on any one tactic like are we both shooting for the same the same goal. Or she do you want to come because I know obviously the chair or the co lead of the human and planetary health investment practice that may feel so I'm assuming you're investing everything is long term mission driven any comments that how investors and founders get aligned for long term. Yeah actually I'll talk about sort of I'll take the I'll say six it two sides of the coin right how do we as investors look for that test for that and then what were sort of some other things that you know very specifically that traveled it right that sort of goes ahead and very trust right first for these any relationship to work well there's a lot of this got to be trust and mutual respect now the way you know I approach a lot of the deep tech companies when founders are first time founders is almost our job is like hopefully the founders are really athletes and and you know we are like a great coach and together we can help sort of in the championship. So that cannot happen when we are just being cheerleaders but that also requires us to first on the trust of the founders and then customize any feedback that we give to you know the game that the founder is playing. And then you know the founder founder themselves and and and and that that does require a good amount of time it's it's hot and that then also means that you know if you're going to spend so much time with a company we can't sort of go ahead and then take a very small state. So the most common mistake that I see a lot of deep tech founding teams do is try and do what I would say is a party round at inception. You know I'll borrow a phrase that Trevor uses when he's recruiting it's called give a shit factor like how you know and it's it's like when people take option on you like you do a three million dollar round with like you know 10 300 thousand dollar checks. Who's really like is this meaningful up people really going to care is this Jackie when word that time right is it word that time to actually come on the board right like really coach you build right because that is the cheapest equity in the company. So besides money fundamentally are you really kind of getting somebody who's going to help you when this game. So so so that was the one thing that and Trevor and so when we had a very tiny seed investment in mammoth he made me work harder than pretty much most other people because you know. If you make that specific when did Trevor ask you to do just so other founders understand what they can ask. I'm going to come to this right so for example you know he shared with us this mission and vision of how he thought that while they do the first diagnostic test. It would be a platform kind of like intel inside and so we said well if it is going to be that mission then you know it's a group the space is crisper you have to get the great IP strategy and we said here's here are some of the best IP people and instead of sort of saying all my friend told me XYZ he actually interviewed and he ended up picking what would otherwise mean may feel is IP diligence people out on it. When it came to simple basic stuff like real estate and stuff like that they didn't even waste time they just took the team and the support they got out of it for finance and accounting right it just kind of ends up creating a lot of straightforward mutual trust where it's like that's not where like a lot of the value gets created a lot of the founders get excited about the novelty of running a company it's very empowering to going to have the money and be the founder and CX or something but but they kept the core focus on that then. You know he encouraged me to then reach out to Jennifer now which we did and then that is what then triggered the conversation where I could come back and say you know like work with Jennifer to see can she come in as a co founder and then Trevor did the work so after that conversation Trevor actually then recruited you know Jennifer and and and then you know other people coming out of her lab to come in as kind of co founders right so these were all of these things that were happening even before we had done our series there but that was a con the cadence of that conversation. So that kind of gives you the sense on how do you kind of because one and so and so now let me kind of say what I'm I looking at as an investor so company won't really grow faster than the founders ability to learn and go right and so and so that is where how fast you learn. Kind of turns out to be can you trust can you benchmark excellence in a different areas right how do you make decisions how do you kind of learn from your mistakes. And move on how do you manage risk. How do you like you know are you really true to the mission right there's a lot of this disconnect that you say people will kind of say a mission but then when a decision comes to test on the mission are people really true. You know in the example that I just mentioned Trevor had to dilute himself over 70% to bring another co founders and that decision for him was a matter of hours that he didn't have to wallow on and days and then he went about going into recruiting the rest of the founding team out of the cause even though. The company had raised the one just he might and the way the you know and that sort of things so so so these I think kind of give you a little bit of the flavor on. On you know is this going to be the kind of relationship where you know at you know over time the mission does get realized. But then if you can I push on you can I ask about may feel that FTX because you know in many ways FTX and for those that don't know FTX is the sphamed crypto company or it's a you know Web 3 company that famously imploded because there was a lot of fraud. At the high levels and may feel along with many of the top high other top high performing funds and so looking about like Sequoia light speed any a Accentra it felt like it was a syndicate round or like a party round into FF. FTX and that you know the narrative is is that the investors turned a blind eye towards appropriate oversight because they because they didn't want to rock the boat you know the the the dangle the carrot of huge returns dangling in front of them over over came what should have been true investor oversight. Can you address that. The versus you know what we're relative to what we're what was just said. So you know the may feel had is what may feel I'd invested in a company called block for you. I had invested a seed round relatively small amount less than a million dollars in in a company that was acquired by FTX and that is how may feel got to sort of have you know shares and FTX. I think you know. So it's clear because then may feel didn't directly invest in FTX it was just passively it ended up getting equity so then maybe this isn't a fair question because and I don't know if you want to give because maybe this is relative to other funds so we can move move forward but was there is there there's a broader narrative going on that that. Let me let me let me but I do have an opinion that I can. So you know it's hard to build trust even when people are in the same place when you're going ahead and building companies across geographies across distance right like I'll give an example of the kind of things that we see a lot of the founders do that you know it wasn't clear if there was enough evidence to that on to the other side. Because you know when you think of a company right investors when I give you money you know when the investors businesses their investors LPs have given them money and have to give them you know returns on top of that so when when you have that right just how do you run the finances. Do you actually encourage companies to start doing audits you know relatively early in life for the company right so actually because what it does is you want to have the you want to have the books you want to know you're like you know a lot of the founders. I mean not have all the full sort of underlying and so. We see a lot of founders will go with finance financial you know acting CFOs or accounting forms that we recommend to do the work for them out on that same thing on the legal side of the house. So I would say for anybody that's starting a company right like it's a good practice because what you're getting when say I'm making a record first for somebody to make into my recommendation list I have to have seen that work. And I have to have known that those are really really good that I've gone ahead and done that over and over again and we've seen that quality of work and it's one of the areas where it's easier for me as a board member to my benchmark excellence because I've seen it across categories across companies are around that. And and to me you know some of those basics as I look at the public reporting and I don't know anything more than what has been reported publicly on it but yeah including like you know the fortune article or the walks article today. It just feels that some of that basic infrastructure that makes a company was kind of lacking over there and when that lag what happens is leaders managers boards don't know what is going on in the company. You don't know what the truth is you don't know whether you can trust the financial statements that kind of wrote up to out around that end and and you know there is a tendency to kind of play fast and lose but. Say I look at those things as core to the infrastructure of a company even the people processes HR systems all of that kind of stuff like that and if there was ever a lesson to sort of go and work through that I think it's like there's like many vice bound foolish to try and cut corners on that kind of stuff. Well thank you or she for answering and I apologize for the question it was I was by it was misguided towards Mayfield and I should we should invite in the other VCs that were really involved but I appreciate your generously commenting on the situation. There's lots of questions for the two of you from the Stanford community obviously we're not going to have enough time to get through everything i'm going to kick it off with the most uploaded question which is for Trevor. How much to doing your PhD help you in this path do you think doing a PhD is a good use of time for students interested in startups or is it better just to learn the technical aspects on the way and waste no time and just start a company instead of spending time in academia. Yeah it's a good question um stuff I want to have thought about so I guess first of all I think doing a PhD is incredibly helpful for doing start up not just on like the technical side and the credentialing but I think for a good PhD program and a successful PhD one of the key well you learned two key things. The first one is resilience because chances are you're just going to fail fail fail fail and you know you just really have to like love what you're doing and like understand and be very mission driven by the goal of whatever research that you're pursuing. I think the second one is that you have to navigate uncertainty unlike you know undergrad or like a master's there's no textbook right there's no like oh like just you know get an A on this test and then like you'll graduate no like you could do everything right and then. You could do everything right and still fail right and that's a part of the resilience aspect as well so I think those mindsets are actually extremely good for a startup because many of these things are going to be the case you don't have a textbook i'm like oh this is how you build like uber of course not otherwise 100 people have done it before you and then the second one is the very often you're going to run into a wall and you're just going to have to be resilient like understand how to pivot around it or to you know overcome whatever it is so I think those mindsets are actually quite good there's many things on a PhD does not. Help you with at all like I think like people management like I mean obviously don't learn any like finance so I think there's many things that you have to to our sheets point learn very quickly but I think you come you can come in with like extremely good mindset coming from a PhD I think that can be a huge asset that being said I have to say I don't think you should do a PhD to do a startup I don't think you'll finish your PhD if that's your goal to be honest with you. I think if you happen to have done a PhD and you're looking at what's next a startup is a real opportunity and you should not shut that door on yourself and like you should really really think about like is that your life's work to take a technology and the interesting thing about myself is that it's not the technology I invented even though I have a PhD but like is there a technology that you believe in so much that you want to dedicate your life to actually seeing that go out into the world and if so yeah like having a PhD is an amazing platform for that and I think it gives you a huge leg up. But very much I would say yeah good luck completing your PhD if you're trying to do it just for a startup in that case yeah just do the startup like that's what you care about right and you know you can learn technical things on the job of course and like you know many of it you're not going to know everything going into a startup anyway so don't think about like oh I learned this and then do the startup right you'll never do the startup you'll just stay learning forever because there's just always new things to look at so anyway I think people that have done a PhD absolutely should be found in company. And I think they do have huge advantages but that being said if you want us to accompany to start a company and Trevor if I can pre-empt the question that I think many of the scientists and academics who are thinking about becoming CEOs might ask if they get comfort in books are there books that you would recommend for somebody who is a novice when it comes to being a CEO that we're salient for you for your development. Yeah I mean there's a time I mean there's like the hard thing about her things there's like zero one there's like plenty of books and podcasts and many things but I think those are like nice and like you should read them and like understand them and you don't have to agree with everything but the way more important thing for me And Erheed and they feel connected us with some of these people early on that turned out to be critical and even became like independent board members actually some were independent board members started diligence calls to me or say say which not many people would bring them on as independent board members of their diligence call but they're just amazing people that have like built companies and who understand startups and the journey that you have to go on as a founder And like having those people around you that's what's critical right like it's like trying to learn to write a bike by reading much of books on how to write a bike like I don't know you want to be on the bike and you want to have people next to you that are like professional cyclists And like are helping you get along that's that's like the number one thing don't spend too much time on the books Terrific thank you Trevor next questions for Trevor genetic editing has a ton of promise do you have anyone on your team who evaluates the ethical considerations of these therapies Oh interesting uh well I hope everyone on the team evaluates the ethical considerations of the therapies Um we don't have a like a full-time role only on that I think uh right now in the crisper space there's two types of it even there's somatic and germline um No company that I know if a new S does uh germline editing so that's kind of the division where What germline means is that it would be passed down to your children um so like if you Uh are cured of Huntington's disease then that cure would be passed down Uh tini kids you might have worse somatic if you're cured of the disease if you have kids they have the exact same probability of having that disease as if you are never cured Um, there's no there's no kind of passing down so um Most of the ethical considerations seem to be around the germline because there's these things around you know like altering the evolution of humanity although you know look at the edifices we build around us there's alter our evolution as well Um, but I think in general we're focused on the somatic and there uh, I think a big ethical question beyond the kind of usual ones around kind of crisper vapes and things like that is what's the highest need and like Where are the areas that you should be prioritizing first because there's like immense need from the patients for transformative therapies and I think that is like a really important consideration when you're looking at where You should be pointing the technology as well whether that's their pedics or diagnostics Are there any bioethical standards that you guys have set as a company or Exercises that you're going through from the very beginning to think about um because you know we had Haymouth, Tenacious Also a VC on and he's talking he was talking you worth the spoke about how you know there can be these unintended long-term Consequences that everybody with good intentions wouldn't want to do but that the company can end up in if you don't Think about them from day zero um are there any exercises like that that Newly the computers in or that are relevant here I think the most relevant one is just what's the culture you're building out the company and being very intentional about that right because it's hard I haven't read that particular book, but it's hard to probably predict Tenuous and hell yeah, where you're at right, but hopefully what you can control and what will help lead you down that path is like How do you what's your decision making framework more generally as like our company and like what do you value? Like are you to the very beginning of this conversation right like are you trying to save as many lives as possible? Right are you trying to Maximize these of the technology are you trying to make healthcare as accessible as possible? Like you can choose your like function and then making sure that you stay true to that like it can be updated over time Like the way we think about our values and some great advice I got early on is that you should always use your values as a lens for decision making And that's how they become real so like you can have them on the wall or whatever But whenever you're making a big decision you should be going down each value and saying okay if I really believe this Like which direction should I be going and hopefully those micro decisions and macro decisions lead you to a good place in 10 years Even if you don't you know that from the very beginning Or she you wanted to comment we have 30 seconds All right, so quick thing is I think You know the I do see this you know move fast break things don't worry about the end product much more endemic in software driven innovation companies or tech driven innovation companies Uh, I think you know companies like mammoth tend to be way more sort of grounded there. It's much more about being real About like the progress the problems that settle things right And so the culture is at the core and either out there and you have to kind of find the balance between innovation and this But pretty much if something is wrong people in the org have to be able to raise their hand without the fear of any repercussions To kind of get that message up And so the culture is at the core right will somewhere along the way people will know if something's not going right And people have to feel empowered to be able to kind of go ahead and bring it up without the fear of being shot Sort of right now and by the leadership The entrepreneurial thought leader series is a Stanford e-corner original production The stories and lessons on Stanford e-corner are designed to help you find the courage and clarity to see and seize opportunities Stanford e-corner is led by the Stanford Technology Ventures program and Stanford's Department of Management Science and Engineering To learn more Please visit us at ecorner.stamford.edu
