 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. On today's episode, we have Sandy Jen, the co-founder of Honor, a senior care service that helps people continue to live well and independently at home. Prior to Honor, Sandy was co-founder and CEO of Mibo, an instant messaging and social networking service provider that helped consumers and publishers connect socially. She holds a degree in computer science from Stanford University. Here is Sandy. Hi, everyone. First off, I just want to know who's here. So how many of you are undergrad? Okay, almost all of you. Freshman? Wow, okay. Softmores, junior seniors. And how many of you are thinking about becoming an entrepreneur or starting a company, kind of getting into that? Okay, cool. Okay. So thanks for having me. It's really nice to be back at Stanford. As Tom said, I graduated over a decade ago, so it's been a long time. This building was not here. You guys are really lucky. It's really nice. And it's not every day that I get invited to speak for 45 minutes about myself. It's a weird thing to happen to you. And a student habits die hard, so I procrastinated and didn't really prep for this talk until about last night. So I have my cheat sheet right here. So when I thought about what I wanted to talk about, what I wanted to share with you, I asked myself, what would I want to hear if I were a student in your place today? And obviously, things are a lot different when I was a student here, but I thought a lot of these things could translate. And so I went down memory lane and sort of thought about my college experience. And remember that it was awesome. Like I love Stanford. But it was also really stressful. Like I remember the exams, the problem sets, the coding projects, the biking in the rain with the plastic safeway bag over my bike seat. And then really hoping I got a job interview at Google because if I didn't, I'd be a total failure to my parents. And it was just really stressful. And to sum it up, I had absolutely no aspirations of becoming an entrepreneur, like Zilch, not at all. But here I am today in front of you talking about entrepreneurship. So how did that happen? It happened through a series of interesting opportunities. Very unlikely, I call myself an unlikely entrepreneur because I didn't come out that way. And I wanted to kind of give you this sort of executive summary about myself where I wasn't building computers when I was six. And I wasn't starting businesses when I was 12, not even a lemonade stand. I played in the dirt. I was shy. I was really insecure. I was quiet. And I grew up in an immigrant family. And so I was there. And now I'm an entrepreneur. I've not as shy as I used to be. I've sold a company to Google. I still occasionally like to play in the dirt. And I'm now running an engineering team and a startup that's helping old people. So not the path that I thought I would take. But I kind of wanted to give you a sort of a snapshot into how I got here so that maybe that will inspire you to sort of find your own path. So first sort of revelation is that you don't have to come out of the womb with a startup idea and a computer. So I've met a lot of founders through my career. And a ton of them have that itch as soon as they're born. They pop out of their mom's womb and they're like, I got a startup company. I was totally not that way whatsoever. I grew up in Maryland in these coasts toâ€¦ Yes, Maryland. To immigrant parents from Taiwan. And they came to the United States to find jobs, to go to graduate school. And so I was born as a first generation Chinese kid. And a very typical suburb in Maryland. And I was shy, like I said, I was quiet. I followed all the rules. I got straight A's. I came home on time. I did my homework. I played piano. I went to Chinese school. I graduated top of my class. I got straight A's. Like I did everything that you're supposed to do. I just sort of followed the path. And my parents were really lucky. I never went through that rebellious teenage phase. So I was like the easiest kid possible. Not someone you would think would move off to the part of the country and help old people one day. So not really what was in plan. And I kind of pretty much did everything with the flow. And according to plan. And so when I was applying to college, I threw Stanford in as a long shot. I was like, there's no way I could make it. I'm like this average kid. It did really well in school. But what's so special in my high school? And so when I got accepted and the possibility became real that I could go to California and leave home, I was really torn because I'd always followed the safe path. Like I got the good grades. You know, I did what my parents wanted me to do. And my parents were going to pay for my education. And so I was really expensive to go to Stanford. I had a scholarship to go to my local state school. And so I was kind of weighing the pros and cons. And I was like, I don't know. Should I do it? And ultimately something kind of clicked. And I was like, well, not every day you get in Stanford. And the doubts were kind of trying to push my want to go to Stanford away because Stanford is like where super smart kids go. And like I'm smart. And I'm not like that smart. And so it was just sort of the stream. I was like, oh my god, the stream could be real. And so ultimately I decided, OK, let's do it. And my parents were super supportive. Although my dad does joke that he could have bought a really nice sports car with all the tuition money you could have saved if I went to Maryland. Because it's pricey here. And so that single decision where I decided to go to Stanford was probably the single most important decision of my life. It set me on a path that would not have happened if I had stayed in Maryland. And I often kind of talk about, think about what my life would have been like if I had not come out to California. And I have to say it would be super different. I'm pretty sure I would not be an entrepreneur. I wouldn't have had the opportunity to push myself the way I did here. And I think the capabilities and the potential that I have realized now would have never sort of materialized. And so sort of a key lesson for me and to impart to you all is that one opportunity like that presents itself, don't take the safe option. Like go and push yourself to say something that's a little bit scary because you just never know where it's going to lead. So fast forward to, one about to graduate. And this wonderful building was not here, but most of my classes and various activities where it gates. And so I was walking through gates to turn it in an assignment or something. And I spy the names Larry Page and Sergey Brin name tags on an office door. And this was back in the day when they had become famous from Google, but they still had an office at Stanford. So that dates me a bit. It's not a little bit old. But that was sort of like a big deal. And when I walked by I was like, oh my gosh, it's Larry and Sergey. Like nerdy celebrity sort of awe. And what was interesting was that when I saw it, it was so unrelatable to me that it was just sort of like a celebrity sighting. Because being sort of a real live Silicon Valley founder seemed impossible. It was like these magical beings that had some sort of interesting combination and rare combination of a lot of skills and brains and ingenuity to sort of start a company. And that seemed so impossible to someone like me who was shy and insecure and didn't think she deserved to go to Stanford and things like that. So you said to trend here while I was not very scared about myself and didn't have a lot of confidence in my abilities. And so that sort of feeling of untouchability of those folks really kind of put a mental block in what I thought I was possible of doing. And so I graduated in 2003. And this was shortly after the first internet bubble burst in a spectacular fashion. And if you mentioned the word start up people who think you were an evil person who's trying to take their money. And so I landed a great job as a software engineer at a semiconductor company and I worked there for a couple years. And I sit there in my cubicle and I think I'm like 23 or something. And I'm thinking there, I'm eating my lunch. I'm like, okay, I got a great education at Stanford. We're taught that we can change the world. I'm 5'2 sitting in this 20 square foot space surrounded by six foot cubicle walls. And I was like, what the hell? Because I was like, what am I doing? I was like having this midlife crisis at age 22. And I was like, I've done all this work. I've gotten the good grades. I've gotten the good school. I've gotten the good job. But I'm not happy. What am I doing here? And so I talked to my boyfriend, the boyfriend who I later married and who's my husband. And he had chosen a very different path. So he was already doing a start up with his co-founder. And he did started it as when he was still in school. So he sort of graduated and sort of jumped right into a startup land. And he and I were talking. And I realized when we were talking that he had flunked the same tests that I did. He had no business background at all. He had acquired funding in a period of time where it was really difficult to get funding because the startup environment was so bad. He wasn't, I mean, he was smart, but he wasn't like a genius. And he was basically as dumb as I was in a lot of ways. And so I was like, well, he did it. I can't, I do it. And the difference was that he didn't have that mental block. He said, oh, I'm just going to go do this. As opposed to what I had was there's no way I could do this. And so that was really eye-opening for me. And I was trying to figure out why was he so happy and enthused and engaged in his sort of work. And I was just not happy whatsoever. And so I tried to shut the shy high school kid part of me out and tried to channel the, let's go to Stanford me more because that part had been sort of nurturing a little bit more of that brave, bravery and courage throughout my college years. And that part ultimately won out. And so I got my butt into gear and opportunity knocked in the form of a partnership with a friend of a friend who wanted to start a venture. And when he asked me if I wanted to join, I was like, hell yes. So which brings me to my next point, which is that everybody has in poster syndrome. And I may have sounded really gung-ho, but I was absolutely terrified. I was like scared, shitless. I had said yes, but I had no idea what I was getting into. I had no idea how startups worked. I had no idea how fundraising worked. I had no idea how to build a team. I had no idea how to do anything. And yet I was like, just keep going. Because why can't I do this, right? And I want to pause and really make this a point because the thing that really crystallized for me was when I saw someone that I could relate to, do something that I thought was impossible. And so accessible role models is really, really important. And I think one of my goals to, you know, coming here and talking to you guys. And I always make time for students is that the unreachable, untouchable sort of founders that you hear in the news are kind of untouchable and unreachable. But there are plenty of founders that are sort of normal folks who, just like you, are sitting in the class, listening to someone talk about entrepreneurship, who have a lot of potential, who never realize that potential. And so for me, it was really important that I saw my, you know, he's not dumb, but I call my dumb husband, do the same thing that I wanted to do. And it was like, okay, someone else could do this so I can soak an eye. So, and consequently, at the end of the day, what's the worst that got happened, right? Like I try something for two years, I fail, you know, it doesn't go anywhere and I go back and get another good job and I go back on that path, right? So the consequences of failing weren't as crazy as, you know, my high school self, I told myself. And I think, you know, a lot of us tend to overthink these things. We list all of, I'm sure all of you have like had to a giant decision and you list the pros and cons and you make a like, spreadsheet of like, what's good and what's bad and then you kind of calculate all the odds of what's the best decision that you can make. And I kind of think of it as the choose of your own adventure book, you know, when you were kid and you like stick your fingers between every single storyline that's possible and then you find the one that you've already read that wasn't good in the effect of best one. I was an optimizer and I, as a kid, like that was what I wanted to do. And so that kind of person generally tends not to trust their gut because there's no data in guts. It's kind of a raw feeling. And so I decided to shut all that out and trust the gut and then really proved myself that I could be an entrepreneur and I could be a really good entrepreneur. And so through, you know, getting to know my co-founders, it wasn't like we formed a team, like the idea just like shot into our brains and then we got funding and boom, we're like, we're a startup. Like, no, nothing works like that. So two years of sort of failing and, you know, exploring ideas and coding prototypes and then getting disillusioned and then, you know, almost quitting and then succeeding a little bit, killing ideas. And then a lot of learning to sort of get things up and running. And all the while, I was still really uncomfortable and I was really scared because, you know, you're still just because you say I'm going to be an entrepreneur, it doesn't mean all this in securities go away. And so even after I quit my job and I was like, I'm committed to this and I, you know, was like, okay, I'm going to use my savings and eat junk food for the next two years. It was still really terrifying. Like I kept thinking, okay, what if someone asked me a question I don't know the answer to or, you know, what if I'm not smart enough to do this? When I'm not good enough? Like, what if this? What if that? And that sometimes that chatter just got really loud. And so one interesting story I want to tell is it got really, really loud when we finally got lined up to pitch to Sequoia Capital. I'm sure a lot of you have heard Sequoia. It's a pretty good VC, I suppose. They funded Google and Yahoo, you know, those folks. And so we each had our part in the presentation and my part was to explain the technology. So I'm like, all right, I got this. So I like studied for hours like, like, you know, as in exam. I was like, okay, what are the coding decisions that we made? What are the bugs that we fixed? Like, what are the design decisions I made? Why did I architect this way? You know, what are the like giant, you know, coding obstacles that we had to overcome? And I was like, I got this, I got this. And I was really, really nervous. We practiced and we practiced. Because you're basically in a room full of billionaires, like generally older white men. And I'm like five, two, like I said. I look like I'm 18 because I'm really young at the time. I won good outfit, which I've recycled for all of my pitches. And you're sitting there thinking, okay, I'm going to ask these people for a lot of money. And then I was like, there's no way they're going to ask me a question about memory management. Why am I stressing about memory management? And that moment of sort of realization was sort of amazing to me. Because I kept thinking I'm a fake, I'm going to post-traumatic, good enough. But I built the product. Like, I did the work. So no one knew that product better than I did. So I wasn't a impostor. I couldn't be. I couldn't be standing here if I wasn't a impostor. And so that sort of quieted the chatter a lot. And there are those sort of key times in my career. And I think it will happen to you guys where you have all the self doubt and you have all the hesitation. And then something crystallizes where you're like, why am I thinking that way? And those moments are extremely powerful. And so I tend to sort of stock those up. So when I do feel insecure or I do feel doubtful, I can kind of remember back to when I was able to overcome that. So what I want to say is that everybody thinks they're not good enough at some point in the careers. Actually, this plays a lot of young women as well. There's always this sort of feeling like, I'm not good enough. I got here because this excuse for that excuse. And it's not that you can't feel that everybody does. It's sort of how you overcome that, how you get over that and move forward. That's really important. And the thing that I want to emphasize is to you got to give yourself a chance to succeed. You got to give yourself a worthwhile shot. And don't shut it down before you even have a chance to try. So we're winding a little bit to before we started the pitch VCs. A lot of folks are always interested in, well, okay, I have an idea. I want to do a startup. Like, what do I do? And the thing I want to emphasize is that ideas are really cheap. If you think you have a brilliant idea, 30 people have already had the same idea. Twenty people are thinking about working on it. Ten people have already started working on it. And five people probably launched variations of it. So no one's special. And there's no successful entrepreneur who's been really successful because they had an idea. They're successful because they'd be able to execute on the idea. So a lot of young entrepreneurs I've talked to are really nervous about sharing their ideas. Oh my God, I have this really cool idea. I want to share it. Someone must might steal it. And I treat it like this, like, really fragile baby. And they wrap it in winter clothes and fleeces. And like, no one can see my baby. But like all babies, babies love running around naked. That's all they want to do. And so your idea needs to run around naked. And the reason I say this is because ideas don't grow in a vacuum. Ideas only improve if you get feedback. And so when we had the idea for me, though, it was through a long series of failures. And I'll go over that. But we asked everybody what they thought. Because if you don't ask, you're never going to find out. And so like I said, the idea is not unique because many people have had that idea. But it's how you craft the idea, how you improve upon it, how you work on it, how you grow it. That's really important. And when ideas are thrown around elsewhere in the country, I think a lot of people will tell you why it's going to fail. Like, oh my god, you're crazy. Why are you doing that? That's never going to work. Or why are you quitting your job? Persuade your silly startup. And what's special about here, Silicon Valley and Stanford in this community, is that people here tell you how to improve the idea. They riff on it. They tell you, oh my god, if you did this, it'd be really cool. Or have you talked to this guy? He had a similar idea. He might be able to get ideas from him. And I think what's special and amazing about this place and why I think, you know, reinforcing the point I made where going to Stanford was sort of the best decision of my life, is that this is a very unique environment. Silicon Valley nurtures crazy people. Like, it nurtures and encourages you to sort of follow the unbeaten path or go nuts on some weird idea, because that's where innovation happens. And I think one of the best pieces of advice I would give folks who asked me, should I move out to California? Should I go and move out to the West Coast and talk to entrepreneurs? I would say yes, because there's nothing like putting yourself in a place where opportunities can grow. And a lot of times, you never know what's going to happen unless you try. So back to Mibo, when we started the venture idea of wanting to start something, we started with a drop box like idea. It kind of didn't get that much excited about it. Tommy was right, took a lot of money. And the thing that we figured out was that if I'd rather go out and have dinner at a restaurant, then code probably wasn't the greatest idea in the world. So we killed that idea and then we ended up doing something more like a media file sharing program, think sort of like Napster-esque, if anybody still remembers Napster, for sort of family files. And then kind of decided while downloads were kind of dying and web apps were kind of way to go. So killed that idea. And the point here is that we kind of stumbled upon the idea for Mibo, which I think, having you actually know what Mibo is, like three people. So basically, Mibo was instant messaging for the web. And so this is like a dumb moment for all of you since everything's on the web these days in mobile. But this is before cell phones, before the browser became really powerful. And so what Mibo did was our tagline to the VCs was we're bringing instant messaging to the web, like hotmail brought email to the web. Like that really dates the time period that I'm thinking about. And so we didn't sort of evolve into that idea until we learned from our failures on the previous ideas. And so instead of sort of trying to nail down the perfect idea, you're never going to, that's never going to happen on the first try. You're going to sort of explore something, you're going to kill something, explore something, kill something. So that's going to get you to something that you're really passionate about. So don't wait for the perfect idea because there are no perfect ideas. And generally speaking, the idea that you first come up with will never be the one that you launch with. That's pretty much like the norm. So next point, make yourself uncomfortable. And so a great analogy that my co-founder Seth likes to use is that doing a startup is like jumping off a cliff and trying to build the airplane around you before you die. And so you can land. And it's very accurate. And the starting of the company is sort of one point in time of your journey. Running it is a totally different beast, totally different beast, and totally different ball game. And so when Mibo got it series A, we got money. And there's a sort of a notion that once you get the money, you get fundraiser like done. You're like, yes, I made it. That's so not true. That's when the easy part, the hard part is actually running the company, like doing the company. And when people give you money, they expect you to do something with it. Generally speaking, get an office space, hire people, pay people, build a product, do stuff with it. And that's the hard part. And so I remember I'm like 23, 24 at this point. And I know like Jack shit about hiring, building a team, managing a team, running a company, like nothing. And I was very uncomfortable. But like I did before, you keep going. And you learn. And so so many times I hear from young entrepreneurs that they need a little bit more experience. Oh, I need to like do four startups for I'd start my own. Or I need to take this class or I need to go and talk to this guy before they can do something. And I didn't do any of that. I was thrown into the deep end of the pool and I was expected to swim. And I think that's sometimes the best way to learn. And so when I was thrown in, I learned how to build a team. Like a really good team. I learned how to operate. I learned how to talk business strategy. I learned how to hire and I still gained confidence. Like I said before, confidence is extremely powerful. And so when my like shy high school persona would have totally freaked out, my sort of confident entrepreneurial aura took over and tried to be calm and learn and move forward. And I remember when I had to interview a few senior hires for me about like the first sort of senior crew that we had to tend to brand to the company. And like I said, I looked like I'm 18. I'm usually wearing a t-shirt and jeans and I'm super short. So I did not look like a senior leader of a company. And I remember though that I had gained confidence myself. I had accomplished a lot more than I thought I could. And so I proceeded to interview like a ton of people who were way older, way more experienced than I was. And you know, guess what they joined. Like Nivo became almost 200 folks before we sold to Google. So we were doing something right. And the thing I'm actually most proud of, you know, besides sort of overcoming a lot of my insecurities and fears was that I was able to build a really good team. Like that team was really special to me. Some of those folks I was able to pull into my current company in honor. And so I've worked with some of these folks for more than a decade now. And a lot of these engineers actually I've pulled from college directly. I've plucked out a different parts of the country. And we've had this really great relationship for a really long time. And they've, you know, gotten married and had kids now. And so the journey that I've taken also has brought along a really, really awesome set of people that I've also taken along with me. So the next part is there's more than Google and Facebook. And the reason I say this is I think when I was a kid, not kid, when I was a student here, like the big names for sort of Microsoft, the usual Microsoft Apple Google. And if you didn't get an interview or you didn't get a job there, it was like you weren't good enough. And I'm here to say that you are plenty good enough if you don't go to those companies. After we sold me about to Google, I got a first hand look inside of Google. And I'd never been in a company's largest Google. Obviously, my first company was not that big. And I basically had my formative working years in a crazy little startup that I started. So I know experience sort of understanding what that kind of machine looked like. And I was really curious. And Google is a magical place. It's full of free food. There are engineers for miles. There are those toilets that make your butt really toasty when you sit down, like that's super cool. And I felt a really big sense of relief when I got me about to Google because, you know, Google is one of the best software companies in the world. And I had landed my team there and hopefully things would turn out really well. And so if I were really smart, I would have just coasted along. I got a great paycheck. Really enjoyed those toilets. And kind of had like a good cushy life. But even though I didn't set out to be an entrepreneur, I became an entrepreneur. And so that mindset was now burned into me. And it was who I was. It was how I operated. It's how I thought. It's how I sort of saw the world. And it took a decade. But I sort of had that entrepreneur's confidence. And it really chafed at Google. I was really surprised. Google's an amazing place to work. But I was really hooked on the pace and the impact that I had at my previous startup. And because I couldn't move as fast, it just bothered me more than I thought it would. And again, though, I was like, oh, I'm going to have kids soon. Google has this great maternity program. I get a great paycheck going every day. I sit on the toilet, get my free food and just relax. But I came home every night and I was like, God, I'm not happy. And something's really wrong. And so I kind of fell back into that trap where Google was a safe option. It would make everybody the best thing for everybody. And again, it was my husband that woke me up again because he was like, look, Sandy. If you don't quit right now, I'm going to do it for you because you're unhappy and you're making me miserable. So that was sort of another kick in the pants. It was like, OK, I like Google. I like this team, but ultimately, this is not the place for me. So I left after about a year and called a quarter, like a year and a half or so. I took some time off. And that time was actually really valuable for me because if you think about it, I did, you know, there was Google for a year and a half or two. There was Mibo for seven years. There was the other company for two years and there was college. And so I didn't really had no time off since high school. So I took the opportunity to watch a lot of bad TV. I did no startup work at all and just sort of tried to get my mojo back and kind of, you know, reset. And some months passed and I was like, well, should I do another startup? Like, do I have the itch again? And the answer was definitely yes. I still had more in me that I wanted to do. I wanted to have more impact. I really needed to sort of just reset and figure out what I wanted to do. And so when my current co-founders of honor freed up, we kind of regrouped and we decided to dive right back in. And so an interesting point I want to make is as a second or third time entrepreneur, you have a lot more experience obviously because you've done a lot. And you have better tuned instincts than the first time around. As first time entrepreneurs, which I think a lot of you like to be, the excitement of being an entrepreneur is kind of like a shot of adrenaline. So it's sort of sustained adrenaline shot that kind of like rides you through the first startup because you're just like full of energy, full of enthusiasm. You can work like 40 million hours a week and you're just like crazy. And later on that adrenaline kind of wears out. But the adrenaline is replaced by, you know, sort of more efficient muscles, you know, sort of thinking a little bit more pause when you act and a lot more experience, which is actually really helpful. And for the second startup, it was actually a big deal to decide to jump back in. And the reason I say this is that, you know, they say the average lifetime of a startup is about seven years. So if you're going to think about doing a startup and really committing to it, you should really commit seven years. That's usually like seven years till some sort of exit event or whether it dies or succeeds or whatever. And it's a commitment. It's sort of like you're trading off social time, family time, you know, personal time to really commit yourself to this venture because ultimately you're responsible for your team, the product, you know, you have producer responsibility to your investors, things like that. And so when we decided that we were going to jump back in, we kind of had these sort of like stipulations of, as a first and much, mebo was really exciting, it was really cool, is, you know, social media, ask stuff, but it didn't have like the world impact that I think an honor had. And when I wanted to do it again, I really wanted more impact. I was hungrier, I was greedy year for, you know, to make a bigger difference in the world because I had these skills and I had these things that I had learned and I really wanted to use them for better. And so the four of us got together and we're like, okay, we're really picky. What do we want to do? And so we decided that it needed to meet three criteria. And the first one was it had to be a huge market. So a huge market translates to huge impact. So if I picked a small, tiny market like people who liked purple cars, like that's a really tiny sort of demographic that I can work with as opposed to senior care, which can affect people worldwide. So huge market. The second idea of the second sort of stipulation was it really had to help people, right? Like I can argue how Mibo, you know, in the beginning helped facilitate communication between friends and family and opened up, you know, chat networks for folks who couldn't get online. But the end of the day, it wasn't like it was like changing someone's life. And so we wanted something that I could look you in the eye and be like, I made your life better. And then the third one, which is interesting, is that we wanted it to be an execution risk. And so the way we think about it and this sort of framework was my co-founder came up with, which I think really resonated with all of us, which was, if you think about a spectrum of a startup, there's market risk and then there's execution risk. And market risk is kind of like Snapchat, where did the world really ache for a messaging platform that had messages that expired after three seconds? I don't know. Like who knows? Like I have no distinct advantage over all of you to figure out what that would work. So there's this sort of market risk of wall. If I build it, like will they come? And then the other end of the spectrum, there's, if I build it, which is that execution risk, well I build it, they will definitely come. But it's really friggin hard to build. And so we wanted this end of the spectrum because I have no, we have no inherent advantages over folks like you who understand like what 18 year olds want on their cell phones. I have no idea. Oh my god, the speed at which you guys text is amazing. But on this side, like I had a lot of, a lot of sort of experience. I knew how to operate. I knew how to hire. I knew how to get resources. We had connections in the BC space. I could get funding. And so we really wanted to skew this way. And so if you sort of think about all three of those criteria, we kind of listed like giant problems in the world like unemployment, poverty, education, childcare, senior care. We even joke that we could like get a VC to get us money to buy out a third world country and fix it. We had to grant aspirations. But then we ultimately decided we didn't want to move to a third world country. So we kind of killed that idea. But that was a scale which we were thinking about. And so my co-founder Seth went to Connecticut to visit his mother and his mother sort of had a lead foot her whole life and got a speedy ticket in Montana, which is really hard to do. And she was driving really slowly. And so he was like, well, what's wrong, mom? And she's like, well, driving's a little harder than it used to be. He's like, holy crap. What am I going to do? You're getting older. You can't drive as well. You live in Connecticut. I live in California. I'm like, what am I going to do? And so that kind of key to sin on the senior space. And so when we kind of started to dig and dig and dig, it was turned out that was like a really interesting problem that we could solve. And so we dove into the senior space. I'll get into a little bit of about honor in a little bit. But one of the things I think that was actually really unique for me was that I made a lot of mistakes at Mibo. Like, first of all, in March of yours, you don't know what you're doing. You're learning as you do. You're in the deep end of the pool. You're learning how to swim. You're building the airplane. At the end of the day, the airplane was kind of like lopsided. And one wing was like really far out. And the other wing was kind of like, you know, gimpy. And the wheels weren't really like there. And so as a second venture, I had the chance to sort of plan out how I wanted to build the airplane as I jumped off the cliff. And that was really exciting for me to learn from my past mistakes. And one of the interesting things was that during the Google acquisition for Mibo, during the last stage of it, you do a lot of sitting around and waiting because it's not actually particularly glamorous. They ask you for documents and you give them documents. And so you kind of sit there and wait for that. There's responses. And we literally sat down and Seth and I wrote down all of the mistakes we had made. And what we would do differently. And so when we started on our, we literally took that list back and said, okay, let's do all these things. So it was a way to sort of like reset and learn. So a little bit about honor. The mission basically is to care for our parents. So pretty sure none of you are super in that market right now. Maybe some of your grandparents are. But it's an extremely personal space. Everybody we've talked to has some personal story. There'd be a loved one, a grandparent, a friend, a neighbor who's gone through this, where home care itself is an interesting industry. It's not changed in 30 years. The space is worth a lot of money. It's like $30 billion a loan, but it's really broken. And so when you put a big market size with a really broken industry, entrepreneurs are like drooling. So we were really, really excited to jump into the space. It's been an interesting journey because it's so different from social media. We came in knowing nothing about home care. And now we're really, really good experts in home care. And I find it a lot more rewarding. One of the interesting things is by the end of the Mibo run, and when we had sold to Google, when someone asked me what Mibo did, it took me like a paragraph to explain. Because it was like, well, it's like this messaging platform with like this like social media event to help like publishers do this or that. And it was just really complicated. So it was really hard to sell. But when people ask me what I do now, I'm like, I'm just trying to help your parents. It's really simple, really, really mission-based statement that I can make and feel really confident about when I go out and sort of talk to people about honor. And the thing is that I'm not 23 anymore. I'm 36. I have a family, so my risk profile is a lot different than it was when I was 24. And what I find really exciting is going to be different from what you guys find exciting. And I went so far away from social media now because at the end of the day, I realized in that world, I was working really hard to make an advertiser, an extra two dollars, when someone clicked on an ad. And I just didn't feel like that was something that I really wanted to continue doing. And so when I had the opportunity to do something new, I really wanted to flip that coin and go all the way to the super mission driven, super hard, super challenging, but really, really worthwhile venture. Because when you, like I said, when you commit yourself to a startup and you commit yourself to a venture, it's grueling. It's a long time to put yourself in one project with one team. And there's a lot of ups and downs, like people say. And for me, it was the possibility to make a lasting impact on the world. I don't think Mibo really did that. And so for me, it was really rewarding to finally go to an industry where I could do that. So for you guys, I mean, a lot of you are probably not interested in home care. But I would say the advice I give you is that when you're contemplating a future startup or even when you're not really in the entrepreneurial mood and you want to go and just get a job, get a great job, pursue something different, look beyond the surface. There are plenty of other companies that do awesome things besides the Google's and the Facebook's. And home care on the surface is not sexy, but we solve a lot of sexy problems, really sexy problems. And so a lot of industries have these really interesting challenges that require engineering thought and ingenuity that you all have. And I think that would be a boon to different industries as well. So this is Seth and me in 2008, I think. And that is me and Seth a decade later at Honor. So we have a lot more gray hairs which I cover up with dye. Seth does not. But it's sort of an interesting snapshot into how we've grown up a bit, I guess. And the other point I want to make is that you might be a little young for this, but you can have a kid and do a start off at the same time. So Honor is about three years old now and I had a baby in year one. Seth also had a baby in year one and so it is possible. And clearly I have another one on the way so it's not like this is not preventing you from having a family. And the reason I say this is that we've had kids, you know, a lot of the, it's really interesting, a lot of the engineers that came over with me from me bow to Honor. When I pluck them out of school, we're, you know, my age or younger, they all have kids now too. And they're, you know, they're working at Honor. And Honor is still the fastest moving, most aggressive, fastest, milestone reaching company I've ever been a part of or worked with. Which means to say that we're still moving really fast. We're still, you know, pushing ourselves. We have families, we have mortgages. We have, you know, so social lives, but at the same time we're very focused. And so like I said before, where I think a lot of, first time entrepreneurs are just running on a adrenaline. We're trying to be a little smarter about how we do things. And work life balance is hard. Like I'm just going to tell you, it's hard. There's no magic formula. I'm sure a lot of moms in here understand that. And I had to learn how to be a mom and a founder. And I didn't realize a lot of the challenges, how real they were for working moms until I became one. Right? And it's even harder when like you have two, you have two babies, you have your, your human baby and you have your company baby. And you had to take care of both. And the pressure of, you know, being responsible for the livelihoods of your team, like we know Honor has, you know, a large number of employees as well. That does weigh on you. Right? And so the thing at the point I'm trying to make is that, you know, the insecurities that come back, especially when you're a mom, the doubts, the fears, all of that, still running inside me all the time. And sometimes it gets really loud. But you just have to keep going. You have to sort of, I on the prize, focus on what you want to get done. And then, you know, balance that out. And sometimes that balance comes at a cost. But it is possible. I know a lot of founder moms who have had kids while they were trying to defund race while they were trying to hire and, you know, pop out babies while they were trying to, you know, get out of a hole or, you know, raise dead or whatever. So challenges always happen. There's never perfect timing. But if you really want something, you should just go and get it. Let's see. So last point is that when I looked back at my career, it all really started again. Like I said, it's multiple times when I decided to come out to California. And it's really amazing how sort of these seemingly small decisions, I guess it wasn't that small, but these decisions sort of take you down different paths. So my final piece of advice is, oh wait, actually before I get that, that, I brought my infant to the office a lot because I couldn't get childcare. And then that's with my son when he was just a few months old. So it is possible. Stop listening to me and go do something. Opportunities open up all the time. You just have to keep an eye out for them. And you got to put yourself in situations where that occurs, right? If I had stayed safe, tucked away in my little suburbia life and state, you know, done what I wanted, like sort of the safe path, none of these opportunities would have opened up for me. And I would never be, I wouldn't be standing here in front of you today. And so my advice is to tell your shy, high school self to shut up and buckle up. So I really like to end these talks with this slide because I think it's a really good summary of the points I'm trying to make. Everybody has doubts, you know, timing, like I said, timing is never perfect. Things are always scary and there are plenty of entrepreneurs who are not the like crazy Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, you know, like Bill Gates types. They're plenty who are like me who are trying to balance a kid and to start up and a really long commute. And you know, we just want to make a difference in the world. And so a lot of you here sitting here, you know, listening to me, I'm flat out that I'm here in front of you. But I can't tell you how to be an entrepreneur. I can't tell you how to pursue the things that you want to do. I can only tell you like sort of my story and how that hopefully that inspires you to, you know, kind of get your button to year and do a little extra things here and there to kind of open up those opportunities for you. And ultimately you have to pull the trigger, right? You have to make the decision to go and act. And so you'll hear a lot of talks from different entrepreneurs in this series and I think hopefully a lot of them will inspire you as well. But at the end of the day, it's up to you. I always would say if a shy, short, quiet kid from Maryland, Serbia can do it, you can too. So thank you. Yes, questions. Yes. I agree. First thing, when you came up with your idea, this young visitor, you're right. Sorry? Yes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're in the syndrome and you came up with your idea. Yes. How do you do the public art as this one, this view and how did you succeed? So at the time, there was like AOL. Would you hang out a few more minutes please and as the curve say, appreciate it. So at the time, there was AOL, I don't know, anybody used AOL anymore, AOL messenger, Yahoo, MSN, ICQ, all sorts of networks. And all of them had sort of these janky apps, but we were the first ones to actually bring a more seamless experience that you could actually just drag and drop windows around, which is now is like whatever, but back then it was like, oh my god. And so we didn't actually go and pitch any VCs until we launched. So we literally just let it out wild so people could test it. And that was the way to get traction. And by the time we had a bunch of users, then the VCs were like, hey, what are you doing? What's that? And then that could became interesting. So VCs now are all almost savvy about consumer internet. And so they generally expect a working product with some user traction before they will even willing to talk to you. So if you're going to go down the sort of more consumer internet route, definitely don't be afraid to put your product out there first because that's another way to share the idea to get feedback. My second question is, it's starting to first form the idea and then have the group or it's their first form with group and then think of an idea. That's a tough question. Oh yeah, sorry. The question is, is it better to form the idea and then get the group or get the group and then form the idea? Let me tell you the number one thing I get asked about is how do I find a co-founder? So if you have a group, keep the group. It's really lonely to be an entrepreneur by yourself. Like I know a lot of founders who are single founders, the burden, the stress, all of that on a single person is just really tough. So if you have an idea, great, like go find people who are passionate about it as well, but if you have a group and you don't have a idea, that's fine too. So either way, but if you can find a co-founder or a group of people that you want to do something with, that's probably, that's the best way to go, just because you can share the stress. Yeah. So Eric Rai has talked about the story about me going, because it was something like father and data learning and then when you think about it, you can say there is a lot of, do you need to have money to sort of cover the risks that you take? Because if you're going on the path of a valid data learning, that means you're doing and then at the same time you're learning, right? So do you need to have the money to cover the risks that you take? That's the first question and then the second question is, how do you know that you have the right product? As we said, you have like, filters, you have to take your idea into it just to make sure that that's possible. Yeah. So the question was, you know, if you decide to commit to a startup, do you have to have the money to cover that risk? So if you don't get a job or have to pay rent and the second question was, how do you know that the product is right? So for the first one, obviously if you are on paycheck to paycheck, that's a little bit harder to take the risk. I ended up saving some money to, and I didn't have student debt, which is a huge fortune, like a fortunate thing that I had in my life because my parents were able to pay for my education. The thing advice I give to folks who are trying to figure out the balance between sort of spending the money, you know, sort of using their savings to go and make that leap versus getting a job or doing it part-time is that you need to set a timeline, right? So folks who, you know, say, okay, I'm going to just do this for two years. I need to have a product by this time, a team by this time, and I need to launch something by this time. It gives you a timeline that you can work with so you can at least plan. So if you are strapped for cash or you're strapped for finances, set a shorter timeline or figure out some way to make sure that you're reaching those milestones. And so it's not some open-ended and big-uis venture that sort of just sucks everything out of your bank account. For the second question, which is, how do I know I have the right product? You just don't. You know if you have a right product. The only way to find out is to launch something and to get feedback. And even when that happens, you still don't know until you sort of see success. And so that's the market-risk part that I was mentioning in that spectrum where if I build it while they come, you just don't know, right? There's no magical formula. Like why did Instagram succeed and why did some other company didn't? Like why does Snapchat become how it is and how another company that had a similar idea didn't get there? A lot of it's timing, a lot of it is the right product. There are certain nuances within the interface that you just have to get right. Sometimes it's sometimes by accident and serendipity. But there's no general, like, okay, I got it. Ready to go. You just have to try and see what happens. Yeah. What are some of the hardest, or most frustrating things without running on? Running on running on. I'd say on is human messy. So at Mibo and a lot of consumer internet, like when you want to test something on users, it's like, oh, I want to change the color of this button. Or oh, if I change this font or if I add this feature, like what happens with users? It's not like a critical end of the world kind of feature. At Honor, we have angry parents. We have angry adult children. We have seniors who have dementia. We have folks who have chronic conditions. We people who are dying. And so it's a very emotionally fraught industry. And so one of the hardest parts is that we have to maintain a really high client experience. Because at the end of the day, like I'm a technologist, I'm an engineer by training. We build a lot of awesome cool tech, but we are a services company, right? We present ourselves as a home-care company. We have a super high tech company from Silicon Valley. And so at the end of the day, the technology serves the end human experience. And that's been challenging for us because a lot of us are used to, oh, if I just like release this code and refresh the page, boom, new app, right? Like that's not how it works in home-care. And so that's probably one of the biggest challenges for us to learn from. It's also more rewarding, right? Because when you actually like save someone a trip to the hospital or some adult child is super happy that their mom is happy, like that's amazing. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you.
