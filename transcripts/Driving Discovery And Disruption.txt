 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. On today's episode we have Anne Wigiski, the CEO and co-founder of 23andMe, a genomics and biotechnology company that provides genetic testing. The company's personal genome test kit was named Invention of the Year by Time magazine in 2008. And in October 2013, Fast Company named Anne the most daring CEO. She holds a BS in Biology from Yale. Here's Anne. I would love for you to tell us your story of what happened from getting from being a biology major. Do we have any biology managers here? Okay, a handful of biology. I was actually, I did my PhD in neuroscience so I'm a biologist as well. And how did you go from that to starting 23andMe? Can you give a little bit of a snapshot of your story? Sure. So I think the real, like let's see advice I give to young people now. The reality is whatever you think your life is going to be at the age of 18 to 22, your life will not be that. And so in some ways like that best thing you can do is just really push yourself to keep learning. And I was really lucky because my parents were people who really didn't worry about like, oh, you have to find what you want to do right away. And they were really supportive of you know, you should find what you're really passionate about. So, so I graduated. I was biology major. I always dreamed. I was like, oh, I should so want to be a doctor. Like I like, I love my pediatrician. I like sick people. I love medicine. I love the biology. I find it so fascinating. But there was something that just didn't feel right. And so I graduated college and I was one of those people I graduated with no job plan. So I drove cross country. I was I was a nanny. I nanny'd actually for a Stanford professor, John Donahue, and his wife in the law school. And my mom made me go to a job there. And in some ways like it kind of shows how random life can be at times. But I went to this job there and I gave my CV to someone and they took my CV and it ended being for Montgomery securities. And she then knew somebody which ended up being the Wallenberg family in Sweden. And I know there's a bunch of Wallenberg buildings. And lo and behold, they interviewed me. I only took the job interview because I wanted the frequent flyer miles. And I was like a good scrappy, you know, Stanford Brat should. And then I took this job and like I had no idea. I didn't even know what a balance she was. Like, and here it was like the Wallenbergs. And like I met Marcus Wallenberg came out to interview me and I was like, I didn't know who he was. I had to meet me at Printer's Inc. I was in flip flops and a skirt and I was like, you get your own bagel over there. And you know, it was like in some ways life is very random. And I ended up on Wall Street and for 10 years I was investing in healthcare companies. I didn't know anything. I didn't even know what Wall Street was. But I knew that it was super interesting and I was learning every single day and learning about how, you know, I had this passion for molecular biology and like for me to be able to meet with like these amazing CEOs who were like pioneering the world. And like my first project was Zeno transplantation. And I would fly around the world and like meet with, you know, great academics who are like, you know, trying to understand whether or not you could transplant animal organs into humans. And so at some point I realized like I wasn't, not that I wasn't learning, but I felt like the healthcare system was not reflective of my values. And I got into investing and I got into, you know, the whole business because I was learning. It was so interesting and I love like the potential of like, oh, we're all going to live better and it's going to be better healthier lives. And then after a while I started to realize that healthcare is this like amazing money machine. And you know, it's $3 trillion. It's the largest part of our economy for a reason. There's so much money in healthcare. And I would have meetings with people who were, you know, CEOs who were like, oh yeah, you know, we were seeing margin expansion because we're really good at collecting from the uninsured. And you're like, oh, like that, you know, margin expansion is good, but like the fact that you're like squeezing poor people, like doesn't sound great. And so I just felt like there was like this ethical debate for me. And so in some ways, 23 me came out of this frustration that like I saw that, you know, the healthcare system was not reflective of me. And I spent probably a year just shorting stocks, like, you know, you're in your anger. Like I'm just going to short everything. Everything failed. It all sucks. And I sat with this one professor and we were talking about, you know, it was obviously at the early days of Google. And that was on my mind and has sort of this discussion. Like, well, what if you just had the world's health information? What could you do? He's like, well, you could solve everything. I was like, well, then we should do that. And it was the beginnings of the social networks and, you know, crowdsourcing and, you know, my space. And it was this idea, well, what if like everyone, like we all have a common interest in our health? Like you look at Livestrong and Susan G. Coleman and all these groups, like people come together and they care. So like, why don't we just all come together with our health information? I don't need pharma and I don't really need all the specific academics. Like, we can crowdsource the world's largest study and empower each of us with our information, like let the people rise. And why is it that your healthcare system is like, why are they all telling you what you want? No one ever asked you. And so like, 23 me came out of a rebellion and in some ways, like we've always meant to be a rebellious brand. It was always about like, I want to change the whole system. And the beauty of Silicon Valley is that you can be totally unrealistic with your expectations of what you can do. And I really believe, like I tell people, I'm a company all the time, I'm like, we really can topple a $3 trillion industry. Like it's going to be amazing, like little little 23 me, but like that's what we're trying to do, like start a revolution. And so, you know, 23 me came out of that sense of like, we're super, I was super frustrated with the industry. I was very clear seeing that the consumer has no power. But there's a potential for crowdsourcing. And I was fortunate to have sort of, you know, the Stanford upbringing in this Silicon Valley community that was really supportive of like, crazy thoughts and like follow your passions. And it's okay to fail. Like everyone fails at different times. Like, do it. And I think that, you know, then it came 23 me. I love this. I love your passion. And this is such a fabulous story. First of all, about the serendipity, but also how once you found your passion, you dug in deep. Now 23 me was such an early, early player in this game. I remember when it started in, this was sort of in this gray market, you know, there were the regulations weren't there yet. Maybe even the science hadn't quite caught up with what you were trying to do. The market certainly wasn't there. Which was most difficult. And how has that changed over time, the technology, the market and the regulations? So the thing that has changed the least, ironically, is the technology. We're actually still using the same platform. One of the things that happened when we were looking at starting the company is I would do calls with experts. And I called somebody at the broad. And I remember him saying, he's like, you don't understand. He's like, the enthusiasm we felt in 1999. We feel it again. The whole world is going to change. And it was because of, of, Affirmatrix had introduced this whole genome chip. And suddenly you could get like all this genetic data. And it was somewhat affordable, it's like $1,000 a chip. And it was like, it was so cool. He's like, we're like kids in a candy store. It's like, the potential is all there. And so that in some ways, like hearing that enthusiasm, the potential, that to me was assigned. We should start the company now because it's cheap enough. And you can really get all this information. So the technology is the one thing I'm really grateful for. It's aluminum and it has an amazing product. It is reliable. It works. They drive the cost down. It just gets cheaper and cheaper. But we're on the same platform that we started with. The regulation in some ways, the regulation in the consumer market, those are two things. It's almost, like I was lucky from the investing world. I learned like Amazon back in 1998. We used to have these discussions all the time. Like, will consumers really put their credit cards online? And in some ways like that seems so crazy now. But that was the discussion. We would debate it. Like, will they change their behaviors? People want to see a good, how would you buy something online? And so in some ways, I had this support. Like when 23 me launched, the consumer was not ready. And into this day, after 11 years, the consumer is now starting to get it. But people have no idea why you would want your genetic information. And our society trains people in that sort of communist sense of like, you should wait for Big Brother to tell you what to do. If it's important, then your doctor will tell you what to do. So we've been, and it's one of the things I've learned, like if you're changing society and how people think and how they work, you have to have patience. And so it's part of it is that you can't do a marketing study. And I can't go and like have, you know, marketing people out there trying to figure out like, what do people really want? They don't even know what they want. Like we have to try and fail and try and fail. And like, and I can see in my mind this world of like consumer driven affordable healthcare. And so we have to sort of create that. So we have to teach the consumer. So the regulatory side, when we launched, we believed like really simply. I own myself. Like it's my body and my genome is just the digital representation of me. And so like, of course I can get access to it. Like why would I not be able to? That seems crazy. Like why would there be any prohibition? And then my taxpayer dollars go to all this genetics research. So why wouldn't I be able to get access to that? Like all I want to do is connect my, my own body, my genome and like understand what's happening with all this research. And like I already paid for that research. Like I want to see what it is. So the idea was like we're not interpreting. Like we're just, we're connecting the dots for you. And sorry, it was like cold. And so we just felt like it was, it was information. It was almost like this is your first amendment, right? Like you couldn't see. And from a lab perspective, we felt like we fell under Clia, which is the clinical laboratory information act managed by Medicare as a laboratory involved test. And so you know, we, you know, in lots of blood tests, like blood tests today and most genetic tests are all LDTs. So we felt like we were under that pathway. Clearly like one of the things that's interesting for me is like, especially from an academic perspective, the history of medicine is so interesting. And you know, birth control tests used to be super controversial. And anytime the consumer is at the point of interaction, like it's a direct to consumer, that's really controversial. So we realized like that we were just getting in something like there's a lot of controversy around us because of the direct to consumer. And so we did have sort of what's now known as the most well-read ever warning letter by the FDA's history, which I actually in some ways I'm really proud of. Like I think that that was a sign that we're like doing something really different. It was sort of radical. Like it's the change that we want. And our approach to it has been to work with the agency and say, you know what, like trying to fight with the agency or like sort of that arrogance of like, well, we'll show you. Like part of it is that you, to really drive change, you have to change the system. And so for me, the best thing that we've done is then partner, partner's not the right word, but that we actually listen to the FDA and we said, we're going to do all the things that you ask us to do and we're going to get a direct to consumer approval for our test. Okay. This all sounds great. And I'm all in. But there have to be some interesting ethical considerations here. I mean, once you give people this information, first of all, the question of what do you do with it? You've mentioned several times, you know, essentially this data is also going into some central place and being used for research. So there's who owns that data and do you own the data? And also then what happens with people to get information that they don't actually, maybe it's not actionable, maybe they get things that scare them? You know, what do you think about from an ethics perspective? Yeah. So we think really here? No. He's across campus. He's across campus, but you know him. Yes. So Hank is a Stanford Ephesus. It was funny because in the early days, we recognized there was going to be all these ethical issues and we could get an Ephesus to work with us. And in some ways, Ephesus were like, no, no, no, this is groundbreaking. We're going to just comment from afar. And it's true. There's been a lot of really interesting ethical questions that have come out of this. My approach to it has been sort of like, there's a real, there's like truth that comes with your DNA. Like, I can tell you whether or not you are related to your family members. And so the same way it's not fun to get a cancer diagnosis and there's no easy way to couch that. Like sometimes you just tell people like, or we make the data obvious, like, you're not related to your father. And is there an ethical debate about whether or not you shoulders and do that? Like, I'm just a big believer that that was consumer choice. I feel like there's truth about you that you should just be in power to learn that about you. There's really interesting ethical debates in that, like, you share DNA with all of us. You share DNA with me, you share DNA with your whole family. And so you might want to learn something, but your sister might not. And so how do you, like, you might learn that you are a carrier for the Brak commutation and your mother learns that she's a carrier for the Brak commutation. And now your sister knows she has a risk factor, but she didn't want to know. So I've just kind of put that all in the bucket. Like, you have a choice to learn about yourself the same way. Like, you have the right to ask about a family history. You have the ability to learn other things about, like, go and get a test on your own. So the reality is, like, we all share DNA in common, but we're about empowering you. And there's definitely considerations that I need to empower you with so that when you are getting this genetic information that you are aware, and we spent over a year with Hank and others on the consent form, making sure that we were as thorough as possible helping think through what are all the different things that she come about with it. And I would say after 11 years of doing this, the number one thing that is with it is with family is you might not want to know something, but you're sibling does. Or you find out that you're not related to, you know, there's a lot of secrets that went to the grave that suddenly are unearthed. And you realize, like, oh, Uncle Joe is actually just Joe. And so there's all kinds of things like that that people start to learn. And we've always just kind of that approach. So the best way to do it is just to be really candid. And I think we have a brand that is very direct and very honest. And is what I've always said when I worked in hospitals, like, there's no easy way to tell someone you have stage 4 cancer. Like, the best thing you can do is be sort of, you know, factual and then help make those decisions. And for me, what we try to do is be very, like, give people the information and then create a community around it so people can start to understand what to do. But let's just talk about privacy down, right? Because now the information is out there. It exists in the world. Who owns it? And the concept points is for me might be one thing. But if the insurance company knows or if the government knows or my employer knows, there might be some interesting consequences that are unintended, can you talk about that? So we do everything we can right now to protect your privacy. The reality is like, I'd love to see Gergino. I'm sure it's wonderful, it's beautiful. But part of the reality is that your bank account is a lot more interesting. And the banking thing. So when I think about people, like the desire to hack in and see, like, oh, you might have blue eyes. Or you might be the most salient. Like, you might have a high risk factor for Alzheimer's. It's just not such a motivation to hack in. And it gets back to in some ways some of the ethical questions is that it's potentially more within a family. Even the insurance companies, like when we talk about insurance, like one, right now, we will never give your information out without specific individual level consent. But we have the question, will insurance companies hack in? I'm like, well, you know, it would be unusual for an insurance company to like break a law to try to get information about a risk factor that they don't really have any great models built around. And plus, we also have this thing. We don't have a legal chain of custody on our customers. So meaning that if you ordered five kits, I have no idea if you ever spat. So from a privacy perspective, like, I don't actually know that you are you. Like, I didn't actually see you spit. It could have been, you know, your five friends spat. It just went to your address. And so I don't actually have a legal chain of custody on my customers. So I think that actually gives a fair amount of, you know, like I said, we do everything we can to protect the privacy of customers. But again, we spend a lot of time with privacy experts. And it was really ingrained in me that, or hammered into me, that privacy doesn't mean not sharing. And that privacy actually means choice. And that people say like, I want to have the choice to say no one sees my data, or I want to have the choice to say, all my family sees my data or make it public that we want to enable choice. And we need to do everything we can to respect your choice. I don't want to share it with anyone. And we need to respect that. But I also need to respect your choice as saying, I want to share it with my whole family. And so we've enabled those kinds of sharing abilities with all of our customers. In terms of the research, we do consent. We ask our customers that they want to consent for research. So it's an opt-in over 85% of our customers today are in fact opting in. And what we find is similar to this sort of goodwill nature of Susan G. Coleman, like people want to, people want to help. You know, there's no such thing as a healthy person. Everyone has something. Everyone has allergies or migraines or eye-thashe emotes. Everyone has something. And so we all want to help each other. And we can all be empathetic to this fact that one of my good friends has cancer. Everyone has a story. Everyone has a friend who has something. You've all seen other people suffer. And we want to help. So the consent for us is it's an opt-in. We ask people then to take questions if you want. But it's always that ability. You have the ability to say, I don't want to take this set of questions. Or I want to withdraw my consent. So everything for us is again, it goes back to that definition of privacy. It's like, it's about choice. And so if you want to participate and take every single survey question we have, do it. And then we will tell you what you participated in. If you don't want to, then don't do it. So do you consider yourself a biology company or a data company? Data. Data company. I mean, yeah, I'm going to guess you have how many data scientists do you have working with you? Well, it's my head of people. A lot. A lot. A lot. A lot. Okay. Well, I think it's probably, it's a fair amount. I mean, we have over 100 PhDs, we're over a third sort of PhDs. Sorry, I hate to bug someone. I just have to get more water. There's some right here. Yeah, I'm just going to, I'm going to go through that. Just wait. Okay, there is more water on campus. Super. So great. Hydrate. Hydrate. Sorry, I don't want to start coughing like crazy. So we have, I mean, what we do, like we see ourselves as a data company. And I think, especially speaking to this kind of crowd, you know, the whole new world is about how do you use data? Like we see what Google can do. We see what Facebook can do. We see what Netflix and Amazon, like all these things are based on data of customers. And so in some ways, I look at this as a tragedy that the most important thing is not like what movie you really want, which is very important. But when you go to the doctor, use your data to tell me what's likely to happen to me. Like I find it crazy that we have this mentality where we absolutely accept, you know, oh, your diagnosis was something like a my friend diagnosed with cancer. Let me go and get five different opinions because there's not consensus. Like we don't actually have the data to know what is the right thing to do. And so what we want to do is like use our data to really transform healthcare. And so we have, I see us as like, we're data company. The first thing we start doing was publishing. We have over 80 publications. We try to collaborate with as many different academic and pharma groups as we can because we feel like your data is really valuable for you. But like in its valuable for one study, but you could participate in she in 100 studies. And our customers, we've actually seen that the average customer has participated in over 200 different research projects. So we're really about trying to empower people to participate more and more in research. So when the next things that we do with data is we hired Richard Scheller, who used to be at Stanford. He is sat in that chair a few years ago, yeah. At this talk? Yeah. Oh, did he? Oh, did he? He was at Chinatown. Yeah, exactly. So cute. Richard. So we hired. Yeah, he was my professor when I was a student. Oh, really? Yeah. Richard, Richard is a lot of fun. He tortures me all the time. So one of the things I also really frustrated me on one I was on Wall Street is that we have this horribly inefficient drug discovery process. It's potentially the only group I know that actively promotes how they get worse every year. Like I mean, I was like, when I started investing in with 700 million to make a drug and now it's $2 billion to make a drug, like it's crazy. It's crazy that I mean, this is where it reminds me of the Communist era of like, where you actively promote like how much you are worse every single year. So something is wrong in the system. Like we like the whole approach, the method, like the method, like something's wrong. So my hope was that if we actually started with a giant human data set and you're getting insights from humans instead of potentially animals, would you actually have a higher likelihood of success? And I think that's where we've actually, like I don't have the ability to say yes yet, but my hope that is in 10 years, I'll be able to say, hey, by starting with a massive, massive human genetic database, I was able to develop drugs faster, better, and cheaper with higher outcomes than the rest of the industry. And so that is like one of the main things we're trying to do with this data is like how do we actually develop insights in our biology and then turn that into potentially therapeutic? Like we publish papers and then also develop therapeutics. And one of the other things I'm also frankly most passionate about is that no one really pays for prevention studies. So like the whole question, you said you're neurobiology, like neurologic. So like how do you prevent Alzheimer's? You know, who's, if we actually really figure out how to prevent Alzheimer's, like who's going to make money on that? No one. So the question there is like who's going to fund that study? And that's kind of the reality is like we're all of, like every single one of us in the room cares about preventing Alzheimer's. But if I had a whole group of pharma execs, not that they're bad, but like no one's going to make money off of prevention unless it's a pill. And so that's what I'm really passionate about. Like are there lifestyle interventions? Is it food? Is it diet? Like what is it we can do? Oh, amazing. Thank you. Oh, and a cough drop. Oh, thank you. So I think that's where I think there's like, I forgot my train of thought. No, it's okay. It's okay. But did you actually say that you want to get into the business of actually developing therapies? Or are you just partnering with companies that do that, giving them using your data and your end developing drugs? Oh, no, we're developing drugs. You are. Yeah, we are developing. Like people, it's funny because I meet people sometimes. I'm like, no, we hired Richard Scheller who spent, you know, 15 years at Stanford and 15 years at Genentech. I mean, like that. And we hired him specifically as I did. We want to develop drugs. So we currently have seven therapists, seven compounds or seven targets under development. And we got the question all the time where people were like, well, did you buy them? I'm like, no, no, they came from the data. Like, well, did you acquire it? I'm like, no, again, came from the data. Like it's literally, it's all from our data. And so we've developed this whole pipeline of our data site. Like we, our, my consumer team, we bring customers in. We ask questions. We have a whole certain, you know, team of PhDs and survey methodology who figure out how to ask questions in the right way. We analyze the data. And then we work with Richard's whole team about how do I translate all these insights into potentially drug targets? So can you give an example? And of that pathway because that's super interesting. It is super interesting. It is super interesting. Where did you start? What kind of insights you got? And what sort of therapy are you developing? So the thing that's interesting about what we have done is that we don't do phenotype specific research. For instance, I don't say, I'm going to go find people with Alzheimer's and I'm going to do a study on Alzheimer's. Like, I take everyone. Like every single person in this room is interesting to me. And all of you have something to contribute. So we, we follow the data. And it's in some ways like it's, it's really hard for people to grasp that. Like we have compounds in all kinds of cancer, asthma, autoimmune. And we pick those compounds or we pick those ideas because that is where the data was most interesting. And we look at the whole story where we can do a genome-wide association study. And then we can, like, looking to see, is this genetic variant associated with these diseases? And then we can look at, oh, at this genetic mutation, people with that mutation, what are all the different conditions they have? So we can do all kinds of interesting, you know, analyses of the data that we have. And we're using that then to develop these compounds. But we don't start with a specific hypothesis. And in some ways, like, when we started the company, that was one of the most controversial parts. Like, I would meet with scientists and they would say, oh, this is a phishing expedition. And get enough data you can find anything. And I think that's where, in some ways, for me, not having a PhD or an MD was helpful because you can think, like, I wasn't trained in a certain specific way. I just had this idea, like, a lot of data sounds good. And so, and we've been able to show now that, like, a lot of data, especially like when it is collected, and I have this appreciation now for the survey methodology team, data that's collected well, analyzed in the right way, we really can get a lot of really fascinating insights. Cool. In a few minutes, I'm going to open up to questions from the audience. So think about your burning questions about the industry, the company, and anything else you have. I'm curious. Let's zoom out to the whole industry because things, the technology is changing so fast in so many different disciplines. What are you most excited about in this area of healthcare and prevention and genomics? Hmm. What makes it about us, and we are too. I'm excited. What I enjoy, like, I think Silicon Valley is really, like, Silicon, like, we have such a culture. There's brilliant people all over the world, but the thing that's really unique about Silicon Valley is we have a culture of risk and innovation. And it just, it helpful because like that, that becomes infectious. Like, people are, like, it's okay to fail. It's okay to start a company and fail. And it's not that, it's not okay in all areas. So what I enjoy is there's really smart people who have been through sort of the startup culture and have done really successful companies and they hit their 40s and they start to get sick. Or they know people who get sick. And so suddenly they become aware of health. And there's really good enthusiasm right now from people who I believe are willing to take risk and really willing to know how to innovate and build companies who are trying to build companies for sort of like the next generation of healthcare. And I'm optimistic. Like, I'm really optimistic about 23 me being able to partner with a number of these groups that can really be able to quickly get you data. So like, some of them that I find fascinating, like, the ability to look at all your radiology. And can you scan it? Like, is there a machine learning that can potentially help scan that in a much better way? To me, that's super interesting. There's companies like Grand Rounds where you can get, you know, expert opinions online. I'm really excited about, so I'm excited about all this sort of like the health 2.0 world and what's happening and the enthusiasm from Silicon Valley going into that. I'm also really excited and I think this is odd. A lot of people don't get this sequence. Even me, has almost no partnerships with hospitals. Like we have no partnership with Stanford. Almost we have one partnership with Nevada with renowned. But I have a partnership with every single retail group. So Target, Walmart, CVS, Sam's Club. And I look at that because like the future of prevention is not with your doctor, but the future of prevention is with Walmart. And the reality is like you, your health and the status of you today is accumulation of what you have done every single day. So I tell my kids all the time, like every single day you're making decisions that are cumulative and then impact your health. So like if you want to prevent disease, you need to take responsibility on a daily basis. And where do you live out your daily basis? Like it might not be in this room, but most of the country lives it out at Walmart. The average person goes there three times a week. So if I want to drive real change in this country, I need to work with Walmart and I need to be where people are going. And the reality is like no one wants to go and hang out in the doctor for fun. Like that's not like I don't happen to like randomly stroll by like Welch Road and like see my doctor like it's not near I mean it's near Sam and Jobby center, but it's like not part of my ecosystem. And so that's for me one of the big things. Like I think retail is going to become really interesting as they partner with healthcare. And I think that's going to become more and more of an ecosystem for us to actually get a lot of our care. So it's interesting because it's really really interesting insight in it. And I think that'll be fascinating to see that play out. Genetics is only one thing you can look at right there. Lots of other things in our systems that aren't necessarily embedded in our genome. It might be in our blood. It might be in other bodily fluids. You know, are you thinking about going in that direction as well? Looking at other. We always. We always. We so we joking out like we always want more data. Data. So we have this debate in house almost for 10 years now about two hot topics. The microbiome and telomeres. So the challenge here is like like when I talk about genetics and the technology I have like my technology platform is spectacular. Like I can't like I'm so grateful to alumina that they have this great platform that's incredibly reliable and robust. And I know that when I give you a result I feel good with those results. I don't quite have that yet. There's a lot of debate and collection. Like I mean the discussions and like my research team they love the debate like do I need the entire sample or do I need part of the sample or what part like I mean the debate is like is kind of fascinating. And so I just don't think it's quite yet there. There's other stuff. Methylate like there's there's a whole other world of other technologies that I think would be interesting. The thing that I'm actually most interested in again it goes with some of the prevention work and somewhat of our rebellious brand and even just my spirit. Like I'm really and also being in Silicon Valley where people like talk about organic and our valley it's really good for you or they bad for you. I would love to do environmental testing and I did in 2008 I did a test called the Body Bird and Study where I was tested for 80 different chemicals and it was really interesting that I was like super high in fire retardants and it was environmental working group who did it. And they're like oh you must fly a lot in coach and I was like I do. And they're like yeah that's circulated air and fabric seats you absorb more than in leather seats. And so I was like oh it's great. Better so. That was class. So it was real and I was really high also in mercury so I stopped so I did a couple things like one I changed out all of our furniture together the fire retardants I stopped eating tuna. But it was really interesting to just know that that was in my body. And I think there's a huge potential for 23 me to have like to bring truth to a lot of these hypotheses like like there's we all know like it's all there's data out there to speculate like oh some of these chemicals are bad but we don't really have data to say exactly how bad or are they really bad in our life? Like they might be horrible and rats at 150 times our concentration but like I don't know what does that mean for us. So I would love to actually bring truth to like some of these questions that are out there like or some of these like is it a hypothesis or like some of the stuff that's about our you know like what we do every day and can we actually bring some real science to that. Very cool. Who wants the first question? I have a preference for students if you're a student. Do you have any students in my hands? There you go. There you go. Hi Jenna. You can't tell engineering and I was wondering you talked about the transition from going through undergrad to whatever you're doing right now and then later on you talked about kids. How do you manage family and be able to invest 10 years of your life on the same project? So I'm going to repeat the question for the audience. It essentially is okay you're working really hard. How do you balance your work and your family? Yeah. So I'm lucky because my sister my sister's life is more crazy than mine because I have two kids and she has five and we both run companies and her company is even bigger. So I think the thing is like it's like one of the lessons you have as a company is that you have to like our product success depends on our prioritization and my my life also depends on my prioritization and so there's some rules I've had like I I stopped traveling for conferences like there's kind of a crazy conference world you can go to endless conferences. I only do stuff that's local or people can come to my office now like it's just it's otherwise it's such a suck of time. Dinner meetings are also usually a total waste of time because you I mean it's the reality is like people usually want something from you and that you can just like ask in 15 minutes and then then you're done. And so I'm really kind of strict like I have to probably like my kids want me like they want me around and so I have to be really disciplined about it and the thing that's been hardest for me is I love like when I first moved to New York I had this mantra I was like I'm going to do everything every opportunity that comes my way I'm going to do it and it's really hard now because I must get a handful of invites every day and it's not in my nature to say no and everything I'm also like the Energizer Bunny like everything looks fun and I can see the potential and everything I'm like well I don't know you know maybe going to Sweden and winter is fun and like it sounds really interesting and so I've had to learn and my team has been really helpful with me of like saying like no like no more travel for me like Sweden and the winter is not good and so so I think you have to just be super disciplined with it and and recognize like there's some things that are fun and some things are not being like out running a company the most important thing like my company is also my child and so for CEOs who are traveling all the time you're missing like it's not functioning well then like you need to actually be there I need to meet with people and I need to spend time with my kids so it's just about like you got to run a strike great did another question back there can you please please speak up yeah actually so let's just say that question first do you plan to essentially give some sort of compensation to those patients the the people who contributed data to if there were some drugs that came out of it in the second question so the question is you know the challenges of starting a capital intensive business right so I think a lot about that like I am frankly like kind of disgusted the way the research environment today treats participants like you're called a human subject like at what point in time do you ever want to be a subject of like it's just it sounds horrible and and I think there's kind of this mentality of like I'm going to get you to consent I'm going to take everything I can from you and then I'm out and and I just like I I just like it's so dirty like it's and so 23 me is like totally built around your partner if you don't like what we're doing you're going to delete your data and that's going to screw us like we have totally set this up to be a balance like I feel compelled every time you answer a question and then there's a publication I need to give you that data back so I don't know what it is like Richard and I sort of talk about this like like we have to do something to floor the people who are participated in some way there's a long lot like we have some studies like our our depression study was 400,000 plus individuals who participate in that study so there's insights from there but then there's going to be 10 years of work to do so I don't I don't know what the right plan is in some ways for people and I hear this all the time if you're a severely depressed individual and you participate in this study and then we discover something and I come back and I'm like I'm going to give you $15 for like what you've done like it's insulting and even for people who have a terminal illness it's not about the money they're not doing it for the money like they're doing it for the respect and that they want to move it forward so I think there's things that we should do we recruit from our our our the 23 me community all the time for studies and so I should definitely if I recruited you for a study like a phase two trial should I do something special so you don't have to pay for drugs or something like that without a doubt like there's things like that we should do I just think it's and I and I don't know what it is but our approach is always like I don't know but we should do the right thing and whatever it is today is not the right thing and so we're going to definitely innovate on it great and the second question had to do with starting a capital and testing we were totally naive you can never start a business saying like oh I need hundreds of millions of dollars um you know we were totally naive with like what it is and like the beauty of being early is like you're just naive and like the reality of venture capitalists they'd like seen it before so they know you're naive um I mean we started a business knowing that um you know we outsourced as much as we could so like our our our capital really went to just hiring people and in some ways like we had built a plan where it's like all the really expensive things we've outsourced um even now we just did a big fund fund raising we raised $250 million but that was because I have this machine that's built and that money is going to go for potentially funding R&D with Richard's team on the therapeutics and a lot for marketing and for potentially acquisitions so we didn't need the capital now there are questions there you go here um I was wondering if there was a plan for like proactive and preventative measures maybe using additional data sources like smartwatches and then you could start to also use that with the data that you already have to give people up for active events so the question is are you thinking of using other sorts of data such as smart watches to augment the data you're getting from your existing tests we would love we're not doing it yet but we would love to start doing that so you can not map like we will that's the kind of data source like is relatively reliable and so I would love to start actually getting you know move like I think about um movement and sleep like those are some of the best diet is really hard to get but movement and sleep would be great super another question back there again hi Larry come and show it um you talked about preventative health care and how a lot of what 23-weeking offers some better lifestyle changes lots of lifestyle changes come with pressure positive pressure from a community so if you go to the active friends you go to the gym with your friends if you have friends that eat hamburgers you eat hamburgers um you know simultaneously you talked about building a good community of users that contribute their data is are there any plans to build a more active community of you know people that are interested in exercising more eating better cooking recipes you need to leverage that community in some way so the question is are you interested in leveraging the community to change better lifestyle choices um I think we want to leverage community when it's really targeted towards something that's genetic or something that like it's a real insight in you so um for instance saying like you're high-risk for Alzheimer's and you know there's our people in their 30s high-risk for Alzheimer's community of them like what what are like we potentially would engage individuals to say let's do a lifestyle intervention study and see if we can change outcomes um we have community we have forums right now on the site um I think that that's an example of potentially where we would partner with groups if we felt like someone else is going to do that better than us like if you really want to start to exercise better or lose weight um there's so many other people who really are experts in that and how what's the right way then we could connect you so we look at a lot of what our communities and our partnerships it should revolve in some way based on something that's really personalized to you and I Lee Deely Eurgenum um so I think our like we think about communities and that and like in some ways like we're such a unique company it's there's everyone talks about sort of diet and weight loss but if I have for instance like very specific recommendations for you and then there's a group of people and they're pulling in information there that a hundred percent I can envision a world doing and we are specifically starting to do a bunch of wellness studies so it would be sort of the diet and exercise like what is it like you know is there a certain diet that's better for you than you know other people in this room and so then you could imagine specific communities there great yes hi my name is Andrew first of all thank you so much for doing this hot food it's awesome and my question concerns what happens when all this data is crunched so I think it's really cool that 23 and me right now is like making drugs using this data but down the line as you said I think it's really interesting that like theoretically the genome is like has infinite power because we can find out like everything about like what genes control what things so what could this pave the way towards like intelligent design and like my question is more like what happens to the people who can't afford to have 23 and me now especially if at least the things like intelligent design where we can make like designer babies as a result of this data because you know people who can't pay for this they can like use their data and figure out what genes they can change to you know improve future generations because that theoretically is what possible it down the line so I think I think the primary question is how are you doing the people who can't afford it who would benefit tremendously from having this information yeah so so I so all answers to the aspect like people who can afford it we do a number of programs trying to enable access so we give away a lot of kits for free we try it like everything we can like right now we have an offer it's you know two kits for $99 or so $49 so we're doing as much as we can to drive down a affordable price the second part in terms of like intelligent design and and and whatnot I think there's a gattica world that is more science fiction than the reality so we know like we know crisper I know cystic fibrosis but I can't cure people yet with cystic fibrosis so there's a long world before I'm going to like have you know a homogenous society of like everyone's choosing this one phenotype that said like I think this is the ethical discussion like as like I look at 23 me part of our mission like I want to understand the genome like I like it keeps what keeps me up and I was like we have this code in us and we don't understand it how can everybody sleep like it's just like I I really like I will I really want to understand like it's so interesting and the fact that it goes back to the beginning of time that's so cool and so I like I want us to be the ones who are understanding and deciphering the genome there's all kinds of ethical questions about crisper and how are you going to use this information and there are realistic you know issues like we have that need to be discussed but I look at our job is like I want to understand it so I want to build on that because one of the concerns I've had earlier early in the early days I was offered to you know participate in and get my genome done which I have not done yet and okay well here is the issue is I'm concerned that do we actually really understand it enough to be giving meaningful data am I going to like and what the rate of knowledge increase of them in this world is is super fast and we still are quite far from really understanding it I mean you're saying how can we sleep at night because we don't understand it and that's my concern is we don't understand it and am I getting information that is you know really accurate so there's information we toggle in some I like this was a regulatory question in some I like we toggle between oh my god your data is so like so actionable and so scary how could you give it to people and then like oh my god you know nothing and it's meaningless whereas like you know pick an argument people like either we're too scary or we're meaningless the reality is like it's it's it's the early days like we know cystic fibrosis mutations and I know broccoli mutations and I know you know like you know some of the familiar hypocluster immune mutations like there's certain mutations we feel really good about there's an entire world in the whole genome sequencing department that makes me nervous and it's very vast vast so you know variants of unknown significance so I might like I used to give this talk that it was you know of called dilaterias me like all when I got my whole genome like all the different ways I should be dead but I'm not and so you know you start to follow my mutations like I had this mutation and like I look and you can look in some of the you know the genetic databases online and be like wow there's like all these like really terrifying diseases associated with this mutation so to me the fact that we don't know everything is like symbolic of life like we don't know everything about everything like it's like but it doesn't mean we shouldn't have it like to me it's like the the journey to actually starting to understand what the genome means is only going to come by starting to actually explore it and I really I really have this belief like everyone can be a scientist my dad like my number one takeaway from the particle physicist is that in in in 1991 1992 my dad ran something called the superconducting super collider and it got shut down by the government and it was going to be the largest you know giant accelerators masher ever and part of the reason why I got shut down is because the physicist couldn't articulate what the value proposition was and all the scientists like I repeat all the time you hurt yourself by wearing the white coat and using big words and talking down to people of course the average population believes more and when it's peltro then they do it anyone at Stanford because she speaks their language and it's like it drives me crazy like we have to empower people and be like you know what be honest we don't understand most the genome but you can all still understand it and it's beautiful and it's fascinating and the whole journey of science is the fact that we don't know that is what inspires all of us to be scientists is like to figure it out it's like there's nothing better like my two great moments are like the birth of my children and like the results of an experiment did it work like same thing with my children did they work but like I just think like for me the fact that's an unknown is the beauty of it and like we're all going to solve it and all of us like every single person on this planet should be interested in it it's about them and I really like I really I so want scientists to embrace this idea of like everyone could be a scientist you don't need a degree like we can all learn in the more that we actually get like you know the person's stalking shelves at Walmart to understand crisper and what's happening and gravitational waves the more we're going to get funding the more we're all going to be connected like the more we're going to actually advance society so I really like to me that's an opportunity we don't know and I think medicine and healthcare in general would be so much better if people actually just admit it like we just don't know mostly things we don't know most of the things of how the body works but it's job security for all the scientists you know and all that thrill of discovery in front of us so it's interesting because a tremendous number of students at Stanford study computer science we know that there's the big sucking sound the CS department as people are looking at the opportunities there can you talk about what you where you see you know what sort of things do you think students should be studying you know should every student take a biology class just as they take you know computer science class what are the things that you know if you came out of school you go everyone should have this type of baseline knowledge in order to just little fulfilling life I mean I'm biased so I would say computer science is definitely like I wish I don't have a CS background like I wish I wish I knew more how to code I think that biology having a basic understanding of biology and the thing that I think is great like the more people understand statistics like I love like when the first books I gave my kids was how to lie with statistics just because I think it's such a great you know kids always start talking about you know numbers my son always quotes different stuff off the internet and that book there's again it's like a really short book how to lie with statistics and it really does a great job of just showing how numbers could be manipulated so I really like if I like my dream hires are people who are computer scientists who have you know a degree also then in statistics and then a degree also in biology it was funny because there was one day I was at describing I was like I'd love to hire you someone you know who's like anthropology computer science biology stats and they're like oh parties and I was like what are you talking about they're like parties sabedis she's a professor at the broad I was like what and they're oh and she's a rock star too she plays in the band so there are some of these people out there I was so surprised and I now love this woman like I spent a lot of time with her um but like to me that's like such a fascinating convergence of like data you know being able to code um the biology and really understanding the numbers and anthropology and anthropology like that's to me also the beauty of like under like being able to relate to people and understanding the story that's behind it like that's the most interesting aspect for me of of your genome is like the story like why do you have these mutations like I kind of love like people you know lost their dark skin for a reason you know like you wanted to absorb more sun and that like there's all every mutation has a story and that's like part of the beauty I want to show is like how we're all connected to the beginning of time and how you evolved to be you sitting here today so let's so let's go back in time okay I'm gonna ask the last question okay so I imagine you are going back to being a student and you're 20 years old what do you wish you knew when you were 20 um you know I think I think there's a lot of things that I again I think my parents like my parents really did a great job of um of encouraging us to to take to take risk and not being afraid of like trying something new and not being afraid of quitting like one the hardest things in some ways is to change um so when I think back on that moment of like when I graduated college and like I remember leaving you know getting the car and leaving in drove cross country I think the number one thing I would I I didn't realize is like how every single experience of my life was cumulative like every every experience so long as I continued to learn everything has become meaningful in retrospect so I can point back to um you know my first boss Marcus Wallenberg who like then invested and you know has been super supportive and like every job even when it was sometimes painful added because I was still learning it all added to my experiences today and I think a back on like I volunteered in um Belvedere Hospital in New York which was like kind of a traumatic experience but those experiences like really formed me and um and I think the thing that I like that I my parents emphasized and that I push other people on today is always quit like leave if you're not learning and if you're not doing something new if you don't feel stimulated and I think that is at that moment in time you sort of worry as a like third year old like my god my life is like so random but I think part of it is like eventually it all comes together and I think it's really important to just like the more you push yourself at some point like there's not that pressure of like oh you have to figure it all out this time but at some point the story comes together well your curiosity your passion your drive your enthusiasm and of course your intelligence are incredibly inspiring please join me in thanking you you have been listening to the draper
