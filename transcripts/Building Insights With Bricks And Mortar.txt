 You were listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. We are so pleased today to continue this series in the fall with James Bashira. I have never met him before until today, but I feel like I know him because I've had so much fun getting ready to do this introduction. How many of you have used tilt before? Well, yeah, and I can see why. This thing has got exponential growth, but it's a wonderful story behind it. James went to Wake Forest University, which is in the south for those of you know where it is. I grew up in Atlanta and I know where Wake Forest is, and that's very, very cool. He also did some incredible work after school in Africa, and I hope that he'll share that with us as well. Well, without further ado, let's welcome the co-founder and CEO of tilt, James Bashira. Thank you, sir. Ah, clicker. Put water right there. Thank you guys for coming to this and having interest in the talk. I hope to keep it informative. I've been helpful for you guys. First off, and I was telling Tom and Ana√≠s this before coming up here in a prep call that it's really special to be here because five, six years ago, when I was living in Cape Town, South Africa, I would listen to these podcasts, and man, it was, I was literally 10,000 miles away, but I felt 10,000 miles away from the center of gravity of the innovation that was happening in the world we live in, out here in Silicon Valley. So it is really surreal to be up here. It's really surreal just to be living in San Francisco and working on tilt in this part of the world. But it's something that I really owe debt and gratitude for these podcasts because I've gotten a lot out of them. So kind of put a little pressure on myself to try to make this super informative and help them give back to the folks that are listening to it here, you guys, and to the people around the world that might be listening in Cape Town, South Africa and beyond. Something I heard one time in a TED talk was to do this right before speaking. And that this is kind of the universal sign for victory. It gets the hormones going. So I tried to do that before I speak, even if it's right in front of the crowd. So I have slides, but because I know the nature of the podcast, I will walk through or talk through the slides for everybody. The first thing that I'm going to talk about is give you a little background on tilt, where it started, what we do, and why we do it. The very high level, if I saw you at a bar or if I saw you in college campus, if I saw you on the quad, I would tell you that tilt is the easiest way to collect money from a group for free. And if you're interested in the start of space or you're a technologist, I would actually kind of put a little bit nuance in it, a little nuance on top of that, I would say, we're building what we think crowdfunding will be like in a mobile world. And our white common-air application is quite literally what we applied with. It was the answer to that question, what will crowdfunding look like in a mobile world? And we had some icing on top of the cake beyond that, but that was the heart of what we were trying to design. A bite-sized simplified version of crowdfunding to our quite literally, you could launch a crowdfunding campaign in the time it takes to write a tweet. That was kind of the challenge we gave us. If you download the app, I hope you see we've gotten close to that. The background, those starts probably before tilt, starts in Cape Town, South Africa. I studied development economics, and if you guys don't have that major here, you guys should. Wake Forest had a great program around development economics. Loved the major, started working the field on the ground in development in Cape Town, South Africa, in microfinance and micro insurance, and started to kind of combine my hobby and my passion. My passion was in poverty alleviation. My hobby I picked up in college was web development. So I started to build out a site called develop.org. Develop.org is essentially an online lending platform that had elements of crowdfunding for developing communities. Similar to Kiva.org focused on micro insurance, however. And in building that out in 2009, 2010, there's one little feature within that site, develop.org, where you could get family and friends to give with you and collectively accomplish $1,000, $5,000. Collectively accomplish something you couldn't individually give. That little feature, that was it, that was the thing. That put it in this brand new category that was forming called crowdfunding. And it put it kind of in this journalist just codified the term in 2010. And I started to think, man, that I thought this was an online lending space. But this feature, this ability to coordinate your resources on an unprecedented instantaneous scale, holy S. I'll say S, for my wife, she always gets mad if I cast. I was like, man, this crowdfunding thing, this might be a decade defining phenomenon. So ability to tap into collective, collaborate and pool our resources on an unprecedented scale could be huge. If you think about it in my favorite web product, so the ones that augment our natural innate behavior as humans, we've been pooling our resources for hundreds, thousands of years. Every civilization I know of is built on shared resources. And yet in 2015 or back then in 2012, it is still phenomenally hard to pool your resources for a neighborhood cause, a awesome party bus with your friends. If you want to run for mayor. We've even had tilts for mayoral candidates in Oakland, Boston, Chicago, New York. If you want to do that, it's not that easy yet. But I felt like this is going to be a really, really big space. Ultimately, develop.org, long story short, in the online lending space, the SEC changed their stance on online lending. That was a swift kick to the stomach and the model that we had. But the kill shot was, it was going to require us on top of registering as broker securities. It was going to require us to do about 10 to 15 minutes of paperwork for every $25 dollar loan. So it made the model pretty untenable. Came back to the US pretty discouraged. In fact, there was three or four months there when I thought there's no way in hell. I'm going to start anything again. It was really, really hard to shut something down after working on it for two years. But I couldn't shake that insight of man, this crowdfunding thing is going to be really, really big. But I was kind of content with just being on the sidelines, watching it, watching it blow up before my eyes and see the power of crowdfunding happen. I was kind of content not doing anything within the space and maybe going to grad school, saving up to go to grad school, and then go work at the World Bank or IMF, work in development. And then another insight hit me. It was this view that man, these current crowdfunding platforms that are really awesome, were still big fans of them Kickstarter or any go-go. These current first generation of these tools, they're really going to struggle to translate to a mobile world. Watching a five minute video reading Nine Loves of Roards, reading eight paragraphs, that might be a lot to try to digest on the bus to work or in a car to class. So in 2011, it was also about the time that Instagram was blowing up as this bite-sized mobile focused version of sharing photos. Now that point is kind of moot because they're owned by Facebook, but at that time, it was a good analog of saying, okay, if we could take our favorite elements of crowdfunding but bring it down in a more bite-sized simplified version, built for a truly mobile world, then maybe we can reach the 1.5 billion connected devices out there, half of which we'll never own a PC. Now that number's 3 billion. If you actually add a ball of crowdfunding platforms, the major ones, us and a few others, there's only a couple hundred thousand people that have started crowdfunding campaigns before. And yet there's two billion connected to three billion connected devices in the world. So that stat, as well as that question that we had early on, what will crowdfunding look like in a mobile world. That was kind of this, the second insight on top of phenolide crowdfunding is going to be really big, was thinking through, okay. That platform or what type of model will excel in a mobile world, mobile context. Start to build that out in my bedroom, back in Dallas, Texas, any Texans here? There we go, all right, there we go, long horns, nice. Sorry about the football season. The idea with tilt was actually very different than how I started develop.org. With tilt, it was a nights and weekends thing. I showed everyone from the homepage to the first version of it, one in feedback from people very different than how I started develop.org. But in showing it to people, an investor down in Austin, Texas, probably the best angel investor in Austin, a guy named Bill Bable, built a company called Webmail and was bought by Rackspace. He was in Austin, just angel investing and reached out, wanting to invest. That he said, in fact, he invited me down to Austin and I drove down there, getting lunch with him, walk up to the restaurant, I see this kind of, this look at disappointment and I'm like, why is he disappointed? It's like, where is your team? I really want to meet the whole team. It's like, there is no team, it's just me. And then look at disappointment, really started to look pretty more like despair and he's like, I saw on the website, it says, we believe this, we're doing, I was like, yeah, I'm handling people's money. I'm trying to make it look legit. He's like, all right, let's grab lunch. We grab lunch and we sit down and he's like, I have an investment thesis that I just can't invest in and solo founders. What you're about to do is going to be so hard. It's going to be so emotionally draining. I actually think about those words and I was like, holy crap, he was right. It's going to be so hard that you really need a co-founder. And I knew it and it wasn't, it really resonated with me, it wasn't news. But with develop.org, I was bringing anyone that I was friends with on to the team. I was handing out co-founder cards like they were going out of style. But with tilt, I was really waiting for the right person and waited seven months after starting it right in the first lines of code before I brought on co-founder. And it was shortly after this conversation with Bill. Went back up to Dallas, went to every meetup I could. I was the most technical of my friends and really didn't, I really felt like we needed a solid, short-footed CTO for what we're about to build and reach back out to Bill and say, hey, Bill, can I come sleep on your couch, John Arnolston? I'm not finding anyone up here in Dallas. And he said, actually, there's a guy here at Rackspace. Basically, does my job, he runs strategy here, he's only 26. And you should chat with him. He is, and I'll never forget the two things he said. The first thing he said was, he has a rare combination of technical and strategic thinking. And the second thing he said was, he's who I would start my next company with. Bill is a phenomenal CTO technologist. And he was saying this 26 year old kid he would bring on his, he's CTO for his next company. So I was like, all right, I've got to get this guy. I have to get this guy on board. He finished the call by saying his name is Caleb. Come on down and see if you can get him on board. Go drive down to Austin. And by the end of it, three hours into this coffee from 7 pm to 10 pm by 10 pm, the coffee shop is shutting down. This guy, Caleb says, all right, I'm putting my two weeks notice tomorrow. And I'm going to quit and join in and build out this company. But that is not how the coffee started. The coffee started with a very stern, very strong, one of our board members is back there. I think both of our board members are actually here in the audience. And they know how strong Caleb looks. He's pretty intimidating, dude. And the coffee started with this pretty jacked Egyptian guy that I never met before. Arms crossing. All right, why am I going to quit my job tomorrow and help you build a crowdfunding platform for party buses and barbecues and bachelor trips? That was a great question. Luckily, I had an answer form. But it was a great question. And that question, I mentioned in this story today because it's something we think about as a company all the time. We actually put a probably a profound amount of thought into that question and why we're building what we're building, how we're building it. The answer that I gave him is the same answer I get in an interview or something at the tilt quarters in San Francisco. And I told him, look, version seven of these things looks very different in version one. And they have to look very different. Version seven would be something like Facebook. It was about six months prior that it was the Arab Spring. So it was just convenient timing. But I was able to say, version seven of Facebook is powering 14 nonviolent revolutions, two of which afterwards became violent. But 14 nonviolent revolutions in the world. That was version seven, version one was an application for voyeurism and exhibitionism on a college campus. I remember my freshman year when it launched, it really was just what did your friends do last night? Which cute girls are in your class on Tuesday, Thursday. And it needed to start that way because it had this everyday, this daily utility in our lives when I started using it. There were many social, social networks launched and coming from the social space, coming from the nonprofit space. I made note of every single one of them and they were all dead on arrival because they didn't have that frequency, that daily use, that utility in people's daily lives, that Facebook had. So in telling them that, I also mirrored, to rear square. He's from Cairo and Alexandria. So I was able to say, look, when people wanted to protest the government in Egypt, they went to to rear square. They went there, not because the government said, okay, this is the designated area for protests. Now, they went there because that's where people already were. So if we focus on building a crowdfunding application that's a very accessible, kind of bite size, one way of, that it's been described, it's kind of a Twitter of crowdfunding, then it's going to get a lot of people on the platform. The first time you use it might be for a group birthday gift, the second time you use it might be for, you know, a tailgate for the game on Saturday. Third time you use it might be for a neighborhood cause, but you're just, you're going to love the platform of the product and you're going to get more and more ambitious in the 17th time you use it. It might be for running for mayor. We've had one of my favorite tilts of all time was, a guy came in, starting using the platform saw his friend using it for a softball league and then he used it two weeks later to collect money for private patrols of his neighborhood in Oakland. I joined the campaign because it was so cool and it literally the first line on the tilt was enough is enough. The crime in Oakland or our part of Oakland is so high, it has the largest, the highest mugging rate of the country and it's only $8,200 for four months of private patrols to someone in a car in a flashlight and we can see if that'll help the situation. I pitched into that tilt, which the guy came across it because of a softball campaign. I pitched into that tilt because I thought it was so cool and I don't think the guy knew and he sent out a newsletter two months later after the first month of the patrols and the newsletter said that they had cut crime by 46%. They had set up a tilt and in 24 hours had collected $82 from 100 households, 24 hours and had used it to cut crime by 46%. Obviously I didn't have that data point when I was talking to Kayla in the coffee shop, but it was very much in the narrative arc of what we thought this product could become if we get enough people on it and build a really easy to use crowdfunding application. So I told him that and by the end of the coffee he was somewhat convinced. We moved down to Austin then after that we applied to Y Combinator, came out here and I can't tell you how jealous I am that you guys have awesome speakers say for today at this campus all the time. I used to ride my bike up here for different lectures, saw a phenomenal Peter Till debate up here one night two or three years ago and it is a really cool part of the world. We moved out here and we thought all right we're going to come out here for Y Combinator and then we're going to go back to Austin and build the company there. But within two or three weeks we really felt this is where we should be. The world moves really really fast here and the ecosystem if it makes it just 5% easier to build our company here then that will pay dividends for the next you know you compound that over a year. That's a pretty big difference. So we stayed out here we really loved it moved up to San Francisco and we started to build our team. The luckiest the single luckiest moment we had as a company I think was the introduction to my co-founder Caleb and that is a theme that has run through from from that introduction to every single person we have working at Till. It is all about the people. I'm going to start talking about that in a second. The second thing I'm going to talk about is perception versus reality and then the third thing I'm going to talk about is cliches which ones actually matter. So perception versus reality let's see if we can get that. There we go. All right so if you haven't used the app super simple download it you can even just download it just to see how other people are using it. It's really easy to use. Perception versus reality or bricks versus mortar. You there what are we looking at? Brick wall exactly that's what I would have said before. We're looking at bricks. But actually we're looking at bricks and mortar. When I was your age you know 2021 I would have said bricks. But I'm going to talk about bricks versus mortar and kind of the step that goes in between the bricks that makes all the difference. Going back to the this slide and telling for the folks on the podcast it's just it is just a picture of bricks and mortar and it is so easy to look at that photo and think that's bricks. But a few years of doing this I'd say the mortar is more important. The difference between bricks and mortar is the difference between just a single finger can push over a stack of bricks. The mortar can help it withstand a hurricane. So in that vein bricks versus mortar I'm going to talk about what I thought was really important versus what I now think is really important. And by the way it's not about it's not x versus y and x is an important. They're both important. It's just that I would have thought x is the thing I would think about and it turns out y the y is all I think about. A little word play there for you. So the person versus the people the perception is it's a person that does something. That's what we see on cover of magazines is a person a face. It is kind of what we see in every heroic novel it is the person. That is the brick. That's the thing that you think it's built on. The mortar is really the people. I would have thought okay be really smart. Be it you know have high integrity have a can do attitude persistence and just think about all the qualities of that person. Man our company has taken off the more and more we stop thinking about ourselves. I really started thinking about the people around us, the network around us. Whether it is investors that have helped refine the idea whether it is the recruits that we brought on that are 10 times smarter than ourselves. Whether is even bringing Caleb on as a co-founder it is the person versus the people the people are the thing that help you withstand that hurricane. The people at tilt whether it is the advisors the investors or our colleagues. That is the most important thing. The people it's it is all about the people. Strategy versus culture Peter Drucker has a quote that goes culture eat strategy for breakfast. Another way of looking at this slide is strategy versus execution. To get anything right you need strategy and execution. You need both and you need to be right about both. You need the X and the Y. But you end up thinking a lot more about the culture the execution and I compare culture to execution kind of like you know when you meet someone and you have body language and in their face the 16 different muscles there is micro expressions and you can pick up on these micro expressions. I look at culture as kind of these micro strategies. How things are done on a Tuesday. What strategy did someone take? Culture is also simply to find is how we treat people and how we treat each other. Bill Campbell said that I think that's one of the best definitions of culture. How we treat each other that's part of our strategy. Treat each other well. Care about each other love each other. We use the word love maybe too much of the office. But strategy would be the bricks but the mortar is the culture. Results versus process. I used to think winning is everything. In fact one of my favorite basketball coaches told me winning solves everything. Jack Welch's book is literally titled winning. But I think that's the brick. Process is the mortar. The simple line there is focus on the process and the results take care of themselves. The results are a byproduct. The aim is getting the right process. When we were super focused even just three years ago on just results we really lost sight of how can we make sure these results compound. How can we make sure these results go on for a long time. We really focus way too much on monthly goals rather than yearly rather than culture rather than all the things that I think go into process. We really focus too much on results. Now we focus very little on results. Focus all of our energy on process and we have the best results we've had today. Complexity versus simplicity. You guys are probably much smarter than I so this one probably doesn't need to be said but when I was younger when I first started listening to these podcasts five six years ago I thought in terms of complexity. The world was a complicated place. It's complex. I mean you you absorb any marketing any marketing message in the last few years. I've been a great company. I mean they are trying to confuse the hell out of you. The company known for simplicity Apple their marketing message was insanely great. Think about what that says to you when you're absorbing that message it's like it's so great there's no way I could ever ever understand how great it's insane. It's literally insane how great this is. No another none of it was insane. It's actually pretty simple or you see on a brand new product patent pending. I mean this is so complex we have a patent for it. It's never been done before and that's kind of the marketing language that I used to consume thinking that okay the first version first version of deval.org had way too many features luckily it had the future where you can invite family and friends but it had way too many features and I spent 19 months building it before I even telling anyone or showing it to anyone I showed it to maybe five people before we launched. I had a business plan and I showed that to everybody but the actual software showed to very very few people and I had it wrong it is all about simplicity. Simplify simplify simplify if you're going to build your own business try to find simplifiers not complicators a lot of people that subscribe even if you subscribe to simplicity if you bring on folks to your team that subscribe to complexity that are complicators rather than simplifiers who you are setting yourself up for a hard time simplify simplify simplify. Journey versus a destination the destination those are the bricks that's what we see in movies you see someone being carried around you see a presentation that floors everybody you see or you read in every narrative about these moments these is whether it is a speech that riles up the crowd or whether it is an aha moment around an idea these are destinations. I was consumed with this idea of if we can get funding I remember reading a tech control of a company that got investment from and Dreson Horowitz and I used the product and they got this investment I was like oh my god they made it. The smartest investors in the world they must know something that I don't and they're just they're golden now they got investment. Now that company is no longer around and we've raised investment from I think the best investors in the world and by the way on the people slide I think we've got an all honesty I think we have the best team in Silicon Valley and we have the best investors in Silicon Valley but I thought that was a destination that once you make it to that plateau you're good you're golden there was probably more anxiety the day after we signed our term sheet with and Dreson Horowitz than any day prior the journey is the destination being able to appreciate all of the moments in between the mortar within the bricks that is really where the soul of the work lives that's where the love lives the the clich√©s the journey is the destination and then six months ago I read an even better version that said the journey is the destination and the obstacles are the journey we're so concerned and this is an American ideal that has some some merit but we're so consumed with overcoming obstacles the obstacles are the thing that is where the resistance lies if we're only concerned with obviating obstacles or overcoming obstacles that would be like going to the gym and never adding weight to the bar there'd be no point that resistance is everything that is what makes you stronger the journey is the destination hurt it a thousand times and I never could appreciate until the last few years decisions versus decisiveness the brick would be decisions you think an ah-ha moment or a decision you hear the the story of you know I remember the story Bill Gates and being in the the meeting with IBM making a deal where they didn't get licensed to the software and they could sell it to other computer manufacturers and that was this brilliant moment this decisive genius move it's not the decision that matters it's being decisive and the decisiveness and being able to take advantage of one of the greatest things you have going for you and starting a startup is that you have rapid feedback loops extremely rapid feedback loops it's not really about the decision it's actually about being extremely decisive so you can have feedback loops on as many things that you've decided as possible it is one of the greatest things about starting a startup is the is the rapidity of these feedback loops you make a decision you try something out of your A B tested you ask a customer you ask a colleague you can move so quickly take advantage of that and know that the value the mortar is the decisiveness the brick is the decision you might be remembered for the right decision but if you're successful you know that you made 99 wrong ones but you just made them so fast that you got to the right one a great marine core quote on this one is there's no there is no wrong decision I know the only wrong decision is indecision I think it's a great great quote number versus the trend the brick is the number the mortar is the trend it's not the number it's the trend if I wrote a book for startup founders I would I would write it's not the number it's the trend that is like that's it that's probably the theme that I think about most I used to think about numbers I used to think about headline grabbing numbers of man this thing got to a million customers this thing got to 10 million users but it's not the number it's the trend the saddest graph in the world is one that looks like this the second saddest graph in the world is one that looks like this there are a lot of viral apps out there that might get to 10 million users that might hit a nominal number and it might sound like holy crap they got it all figured out but you check in with six six months later a year later and that not that high water marks might still be there but the trend is definitely going on the wrong direction that trend is the health if there's anything that every single technology company in the world is judged on whether it's Google or whether it's two folks in a garage just getting started it is the trend and it really simply all comes down to that trend the thing about this this one is it allows you to also care a lot when the numbers are small but the trend is good if you're just getting started you know a week over week trend 5% 6% 10% that is much better than hitting some nominal number that sounds really big it's not the number it's the trend and this correlates to the best advice I ever got from one of my from one of my basketball coaches it's not how you start it's how you finish so that I told you the third part was going to be about cliches but I've included all the cliches in the last slides they were the mortar in between all the slides it's all about the people culture eat strategy for breakfast manage the process and the results take care of themselves simplify simplify simplify the journey is the destination the only wrong decision is indecision and it's not how you start it's how you finish those seven cliches um there are the mortar I heard all seven of those a thousand times growing up you guys have probably all heard them a thousand times if not ten thousand times and yet we still look at the bricks whether it's through trial tribulation or whether it's through a piece of advice you can grab from from this podcast or this lecture it is to try to see the mortar and maybe take a flyer and trust me that that mortar is the thing that you start to look at and think about much more than anything else and these seven cliches there are a lot of cliches that that don't really amount to truth but I have a feeling these seven cliches stand the test of time because they do one last one is a picture is worth a thousand words this one's just for fun for those in the podcast that can't see we've got users a tilt around the country now around the world that take the tilt flag up to the top of a height just to get a picture with it one kid actually made a wooden logo of tilt a replica of our of our logo it's that's painted on a wooden wall in our office in San Francisco and another one God save him got a a tattoo of our logo that was maybe a month ago that's the mortar in between everything that we do there are decisions there are moments there numbers there are hires there are bricks every single day it's so tempting to look at a graph and think about a graph in Silicon Valley but it's our users our customers that we think most about that we obsess most about these moments don't show up they're the qualification not the quantification of what we do and they don't show up in any graph but it is the mortar we think more about than anything else and the graphs really take care of themselves if you start to think about the process the mortar and your customers above all else so thank you and I think we're going to open up to questions all right if you got if you guys have any all right any questions real quick any tilt ambassadors here I think we have a few there we go all right we got a few on campus on Sanford tilt ambassador so you guys should sign up for that's till calm slash ambassador we have ambassadors around the country now in Canada the UK Netherlands and a few other countries that that we have we are in beta about to flip the switch on and their folks that get to put on their LinkedIn that they're working for a tech company if you have interest in working for a tech company after you graduate then obviously having something on the resume and some experience beforehand helps but even more than that the mortar is they get to learn about marketing get to learn about sales they get to learn so much about our product and how we choose certain strategies with our product design we really bring them pretty close to the last and show them the inner workings a lot of them have come through the office and we've got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds I think we have over a thousand so yeah till calm slash ambassador if you're interested in and in what we're doing but yeah questions sure what's the value behind the tilt features or that is to say the minimum goal that's set before people's cars get charged where you get the funds versus people just you know they're cars going to charge right off the bat like go find me yeah so the question was what is what's the tilt feature all about what's special about it um so you know tilt feature some of these things are you know whenever there's some secret sauce entrepreneurs always a pretty savvy to dodge the question but I'll hit it straight on the tilt feature is is really important what it allows you to do is you you set up a tilt uh download the app and you can set up a tilt in 12 13 seconds collect money for anything let's say it's for the tailgate on on Saturday um the minimum you need is 350 bucks to make it happen or we'll let's say it's you know getting tickets to Coachella or a community cause where you want to fix potholes that cost two thousand dollars you don't want to find yourself and if you use cash checks paypal um Venmo you you can find yourself a hundred and forty dollars in but not near the goal the amount that you actually need to fix the potholes the tilt feature allows the organizer to have risk-free ability to start collecting money for that cost so if it's two thousand dollars until you hit that until you get to two thousand dollars the cards are just authorized but not charge once you hit that two thousand and twelve dollars that you need for their fixing the potholes it charges all of the cards and the money's deposit in the next day so the the real benefit um i know stanford uses the app for selling t-shirts and in a peril for fraternity sororities homecoming things like that a lot um and the benefit is you might have a minimum order of 25 shirts that need to be ordered uh so you don't want to sell or start collecting money and you only get to 11 or 12 or 13 that's kind of a tactical benefit the psychological benefit is for the organizer they're able to toss up a tilt without worrying about that risk and it greatly lowers that threshold uh you know that burden on that organizer and you don't have to use the tilt feature by the way you can uh set it up to uh to where you you don't use the feature at all though yep how did you manage as a solo founder when bringing someone else into your company like this issue of like someone who's working on your baby or something that's been working for almost a year um it's simple one i was working on it you know mainly nights and weekends so it didn't feel like you know my baby it it didn't some respects but i had already gone through that my baby controlling kind of uh mindset and it led to a defunct startup so i think with this one it was it was much more open um you know i think that control comes from fear and that control around the um uh and then in the concept of this is my baby and and kind of limiting uh how many hands or our cooks are in the kitchen um comes from this fear that they're um going to take in the wrong direction or it's going to somehow hurt the effort the truth is that takes it takes a lot of uh overconfidence borderline arrogance to to feel like okay if if i could do every job then it would all be great if you bring on someone better smarter than yourself and you understand that and i'm going to have to have trust with letting uh go of this thing and losing control on so many different parts of it in the next few years if you really care about the mission of what you're trying to achieve and uh and build something of uh your massive significance then you know how many people are going to have to be on board so you get pretty comfortable early on um when their hands are are in their helping especially if you really trust them um to be better than you at what they're brought on to do but i definitely believe in separation of concerns division of labor you really want to know um what you're looking for and what role that person will have if you want conflict have two people uh do the same job uh and uh and so it's it's something that you really uh want to find the right person that allows you to focus on one thing and they get to focus on the other and then you you don't really think about it too much you're really glad that person's there yep um so you mentioned that you studied developing economies in school and that you have a passion this is kind of idea of social good and social justice on a day-to-day basis as a CEO of a tech company how do you bring that passion into your work how do i bring my the passion for the development uh aspect of my life or kind of poverty alleviation uh passion into my daily work at tilt super simple um and it actually goes to kind of an imagery that that uh that i i always think about when i was in capetown and the townships right outside of capetowns called kailicha and uh i saw pretty much everyone with an android phone pretty much every single person two thousand ten had an android phone with google on it more information in their pockets than the president of the united states had fifteen years prior to that that's a private tech company out here in silicon valley so i i kind of looked at that and and made a very cursory observation that they've probably done more for education than any education organization that's ever exist in the history of the world by doing what they did feeling like it was a vocation more than just a job and a craft more than work and uh and they were able to put more information on pockets than the the rest you know that then the president of the united states had fifteen years prior that sounds hyperbolic but it's it's probably accurate um and so when i think of tilt and i think about how it can impact the world as a company we care so much about our mission probably to a radical amount that we openly say i openly say that if some other company comes along can achieve our mission better than we can then if we really care about the mission and that's good for the world our mission is to power the collective creation of the world and it really goes to this problem we we feel deeply passionate about is um just this this high difficulty and inability to participate in the creation of the world around us you want to change something on campus it's really hard you want to fix potholes in the street appeal to the city for two years you want to improve the safety of your neighborhood best of luck with tilt that allows you to have and take something that's happening in parallel that we think a lot about that is this this self organization um of all of us into various communities online that's happening right now in the view in the big bet is these communities are going to want to do something with these connections they're going to take collective voice and add collective muscle to it so if you add to answer your question most directly if you add time to the equation five seven seventeen years then um i think it directly will impact development ask from one over here yep so speaking of ethics do you guys moderate at all what you consider the tilt four so if someone wants to tilt for pornography or for you know a k k rally do you guys step in there and if so where do you draw that ethical line yeah the question was around great question all these are great questions um the question was around where do we draw the line on what we allow and don't allow on the platform thematically i'd say openness and accessibility or tenets of how we build software openness and accessibility so from the openness angle we want to be able to provide software for anyone and everyone that might have things they might think differently than we do they might care about things differently than we do um there are some ground rules that we care deeply about and that's no firearms no gambling no pornography um but outside of those very uh limited things it's really up for people to use however they want and that's really important to us as software developers the accessibility part is both it being open and accessible but it's also getting it out into the world as many pockets as possible and i'm sure we're going to have we're going to see it and we have seen it used for things that we might not agree with but uh we don't think we should be the arbiters of how this technology should be used yep one something like processing payments is so important in business how do you pick the partners our payments and how do you build that relationship as you grow as a great question too the question was around how do we pick payments partners you know we look at payments kind of like we look at server infrastructure it's similar to AWS we look at payments partners as kind of an infrastructural um technology beneath our our social layer and and it's really important as our our servers um it's not quite where AWS is so we have a number of partners that we work with um but we develop pretty strong personal relationships with them because for them for the most part we're asking them to process uh crowdfunding uh realm that's really new and when we started the company uh we got shut down by three different processors some of the scariest nights were going to bed uh and and thinking that I might wake up tomorrow and a very important part of the business is is no longer there um that was only three years ago so it's it is it is caught up quite a bit but Stripe for example only started allowing Stripe and Brain Tree to the biggest processors out there only start and PayPal only started uh taking on crowdfunding in the last one or two years so uh we've kind of really pushed the limits and been on the bleeding edge of of that technology and um there's a great payments come but I want to give a shout out to called balanced payments that uh so a scrappy um 11 person team that um is no longer around but they took a bet on us as a as a client and and we eternally grateful for them because at that point especially going through Y Comner we had nowhere to turn so um we we've had to form deeply personal relationships with with these folks one in Europe we uh we got so close to that person reach out and said can I join your team any synthass yes you have any favorite tilts any favorite tilts as a great question and my view on it is i've got too many um one of my favorite ones uh recently 133 uh northwestern students I might get some of the details wrong but 133 northwestern students this was really recently and last uh maybe a week or two ago um they they got to take it still black hawks game 133 friends and the reason I find that cool um is that just wouldn't happen without tilt just trying to coordinate and experience a 10 friends going to a black hawks game going to a concert together that is a if you've ever been that organizer pretty much all of us have tried that and then we were so stung by it we're like we're never doing that again um that uh that it's a huge headache to see 133 people be able to go to it something and have an experience together and we've had a maturation or views of these group experiences that I used to think it was all about nonprofits uh and getting to that that realm is quickly as possible touching on that that question and poverty alleviation but I read a study one time that said the peak of human existence um and study 10,000 people in their deathbeds and said the peak of human existence uh the moment is the moments in it and experiences we share with the people we know and love and so building software that allows that to happen much more often more seamlessly um there actually is a very special part of uh so I really find those tilts to be really cool to watch um but my favorite one maybe more uh on the social side is we have an enterprise tool called open tilt open where you can bend and flex and customize it brand it however you want um it's built to be kind of the the WordPress of crowdfunding powered by our API and only a few of our folks work on it but it's powered uh some of the biggest crowdfunding campaigns uh and projects of all time tens of millions of dollars and uh one of which was for an AIDS vaccine and you heard me right AIDS vaccine being crowdfunded um and they still have I think six or seven more trials to go but for the first one they crowdfunded it using our software that's pretty phenomenal and shows uh shows kind of the the future I hope uh of what tilt becomes give one more yeah right over here or a few more if we got the time you uh raised 67 67 million or something like that and started with two and 12 and 20 and 30 can you how does it feel to to start with two and to prove the concept and what do you need to go to the next step what are the essential parts to grow a company and the next thing you have investment in Holland that just came from Holland all right there we go you're helping your second or your uh 100 investment perfect what's your name Vincent Vincent all right I'll send you the slide deck I just presented on a few minutes ago that'll tell you all the things that I think about in between those funding uh announcements um that's you know that really is the the genuine thing is uh we think about all of those things in a building the company we think about the people that's the reason the first slide was about the people it is all about the people um hiring the right the right people and if that's going to start it's really really hard to find great people on top of that in this environment it's really hard to find great people but uh keeping the bar high has been them one of them it's been the most important thing we've done and it's been the thing we've been luckiest on yeah yep oh right here yep and I didn't know this I knew in google this stuff and those are great so I just so I just discovered this and I think it's very simple it's easy to use um and secure it too so I wonder how do you distinguish from the competition yeah so the question was how do we distinguish from the competition one um I'll repeat that you know it really is true in our book all crowdfunding is good crowdfunding so whichever platform you use um and we're big fans of I mean I mean we're big fans of a lot of them um and know a lot of the team members really love them our version is really built for a mobile world so and it's in it's kind of another way of saying is we've taken our favorite elements of crowdfunding but provided for groups and communities that already know each other to be able to toss up a crowdfunding campaign from your phone really easily and be able to tag your friends to it it sounds crowdfunding from your mobile phone sounds really hard um but we've worked tirelessly and a lot of smart people coming together to try to build and I think we we built a pretty simple beautiful solution for you to collect two five ten thousand dollars we've had campaigns collect hundreds of thousand dollars using the application yes um you probably do a lot of race management and it's always if our early city start up you know for me early um what is your biggest worry as to why is my fail one day what is my biggest worry to why tilt might fail one day and and what's the risk management there um so you know going back to the bricks versus mortar um analogy I would think it I would have thought it's things like competitors uh I would have thought it's things um like you know getting funding I think it's the truth is you know when we were starting the company going through why commentator we looked at the two luminaries drop box in Airbnb and one was an engineering centric brand and one was a uh and one was a design centric brand and we thought okay which one are we going to be what's going to be our um you know our competitive advantage for other starters being started right now and in thinking about it just it seemed much more for us at least people were going to be our core competency um I talk about a lot because I feel like that is our our not only core competency but our our competitive advantage if you think about in 2015 what can differentiate or what can um what can change the vector of what a company can accomplish it is the people it's not 1995 where it's uh it's fundraising it's not 2005 where it's ip um it is it's really none of those things um it's not it's not the technology that you have um or these modes that you can just uh kind of um arbitrarily add to it uh the biggest thing that you can do to affect this to being this in terms of potency or impact of your company is is get the the best people possible we have and we have yeah it's uh I won't go too much into it but that is um you are brand uh quite literally uh we think about it in terms of we want to be the place where people go to become better human beings and be a brand that that can actually live up to that um so hiring people that are you know collective average IQ of 150 but also extremely awesome human beings good human beings um and really you know wise I think my favorite definition of wisdom is knowing what's important out of a thousand different variables what is the most important one um to answer your question in 2015 for what we're building it is the people that is the biggest risk and as where we we put the most uh thought into but it's also uh one of the greatest things about the people we get to work with is they look at the same thousand variables and they come to the same conclusion okay um yeah right there so you keep alluding to the fact that you can't worry about the mission and the company necessarily but if at any point on the process another company came along that did do it better than till and was threatening the business then you know what what your next step speed would you join them or try to outperform them or so um the question was if someone came along and could could um would have more efficacy towards our mission than we could what would we do would we join them to be honest yo it's a developer convention but it's when we think about a lot it's climb the hill you're on um and so right now we focus on what we're doing the next 90 days the next uh 12 18 months and we focus on our customers a lot i've never really thought about that hypothetical um but no one else i bet we'd come up with a pretty good plan of action but um but yeah it's a good question i'll let you know if it comes out all right thank you guys you have been listening to the draper Fisher-Jurvis and entrepreneurial thought leader series brought you weekly by the Stanford Technologies Entries program you can find
