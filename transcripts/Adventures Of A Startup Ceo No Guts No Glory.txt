 You were listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders Series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at edcorner.stanford.edu. Welcome to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders seminar series. I am Mike Rothenberg, the student director of the series. The series is brought to you each week by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program and the Business Association of Stanford Engineering Students. It is shown on TV by SCPD and generously underwritten by Draper Fisher-Jurvisson. Today we have the great honor of welcoming two fabulous guests, Warren Picard and Andrew Frame. Warren is a partner at DFJ and a long time friend of Stanford's. In fact, he has three degrees from Stanford, including a BS in MS in mechanical engineering and an MBA from the Graduate School of Business here. In addition, he is an engineer himself and a successful entrepreneur and has helped dozens more companies succeed. Some of the highlights, his former investments have been acquired by Sun Microsystems, Ask Jeaves and Viacom among others. And before that, he co-founded and got a database systems which was acquired by Personify. Today Warren will be interviewing Andrew Frame, the CEO of Uma, which is a DFJ investment. Andrew has had a illustrious career himself by the age of 17. He was already working for Cisco Systems and by the age of 18 he was awarded with two CCIE certificates, which is Cisco's top technical honor and was not only the youngest CCIE in the world, but one of eight dual CCIE's in the world. Andrew has worked at PROCATE Networks and CHAPE's Networks and has since then founded Uma and been featured in Business Weeks top 30 entrepreneurs under 30. So without further ado, please help me welcome Andrew and Warren. Indeed, it's terrific to be back here. The camera is going to be on my arm all day. I'll say that. When I was here at Stanford, I played on the Ultimate Frisbee team and I'm still trying to play Ultimate, but I broke myself about four weeks ago. It comes off in two weeks. Any biomechanical engineers here, if you want to hasten my recovery, please do. So I was here for many years. I joked that I was on the remedial program because I stayed here for six years getting my bachelor's and master's, but it's such a great place, hard to leave. Came back for business school. While I was here, I started a company with a buddy of mine that was getting his PhD in the CS department. And I'll tell more stories about that a little bit later. But coming out of business school, my company got funded. They didn't need me anymore because I hadn't been working full time and we had hired all sorts of folks into the company. So I jumped into the venture capital business and it's been tremendously fun. I've been very fortunate to have been in the business since 1996. Lots has happened since then. And one of the greatest joys that I get is working with phenomenal entrepreneurs. But what we do day and day out is we invite entrepreneurs in to present their business opportunity to present themselves. And it's the combination of a truly charismatic, intelligent, just someone full of gumption. Keep it coming. Good. Yeah. It's a combination of all those things that makes for a great entrepreneur. And then it's a great business opportunity, a great market, a large market size, a great meeting, a great customer need. All these things wrap up into identifying a great opportunity. So at the end of the day, being a venture capitalist is actually a very easy business. You just wait for somebody like Andrew to walk in the door with the opportunity that he has presented. Now, we're going to leave a few things for the imagination here because Uma isn't rolled out just yet and Andrew will explain all those things. But the more poignant tales are tales of a startup entrepreneur and how you start from inception and get all the way to where they are now and beyond. And Andrew's got some great lessons to pass along to us that he's learned over the past end years. I'll let him fill in the blanks, but now without further ado, Andrew frame and ten lessons he's learned. Yeah. So I started my first business. I was 15. It was in Las Vegas. It was an ISP and ended up scaling that and selling that when I was 17. That was my first sort of entrepreneurial experience. And as they mentioned, I joined Cisco when I was 17 and it gave me my first sort of big company experience. It wasn't a dramatically large company, but it was, you know, 10,000 employees and worked there for about five years before joining another startup called Pocket Networks where we built a terribate router. It was my first true startup experience where we raised a lot of money and went through the startup roller coaster. And I started Uma and I've been waiting to start a bigger vision company for some time and it's taking me going through those different company experiences to prepare me for Uma. And again, unfortunately we can't talk about the product, we can't talk about the technology. Necessarily we're here to really focus on the company and some of the lessons learned that I've learned anyways. And soon you guys will find out all about Uma. I promise it's coming soon and it's going to be a pretty high profile. So without further ado, 10 things I've learned about starting a company. The first thing, and you guys have heard this before, I want to emphasize, it's very, very difficult to start a company, whether it's in a large market or a small market. So why would you start it in a small market? Like the big markets, study the competition. When I first started the company, it's not that I had some technology and I was looking for some way to apply it to a market. It didn't start with a technology, even though I had a technology background. It started with a market. I found a market that was growing extraordinarily fast, had lots of competition but at the same time there was a very low bar for innovation and decided to study that market. And the market, I'll just be a little bit more specific. It's in the telecom space. It's residential phone service. And we see a pretty dramatic change happening in phone service with the advent of Voice Over IP. We've seen some companies come out and do these types of solutions. There's not a lot of innovation in the space. I can't go into any more detail but that's the market I chose because we basically see the whole world transforming from using regular telephone service from the phone company to some version of Voice Over IP. Okay? That's as much detail as we'll do. But that market is huge. We're talking 100 billion dollars a year is spent in residential phone service in the US alone. Okay? And it's going under a dramatic transformation. So that to me was a great market opportunity to come in, study the strengths and weaknesses of all the solutions in the market and figure out a way to enter with a disruptive edge through some technology that we created to address this market and ultimately dislocate it. One of the reasons we can't talk about it is because when we do come out, I mean, there's a very competitive nature to this and we're very careful about the sort of reaction we're going to get from the incumbents in that industry so we can't talk about it yet. But I promise it's disruptive and you will hear all about it soon. Recruiting. As an entrepreneur, this is the most important thing that you can do. I'm a young entrepreneur. I can't go out this alone. I need a team. I need an army of people. And there's sort of two different levels of recruiting. You have executive recruiting and you have staff recruiting and they're two totally different monsters. Your leadership team, you want the best in the world at the position that you need them for. And for us, we don't go out and put out ads on monster and hot jobs and stuff like that. We are actively scouting and actively recruiting for talent. The people that we bring into the organization are superstars at wherever they are. These are very well established companies. These are people that are very high up, reporting to the CEO and doing a fantastic job. We come in and it takes us time to first of all get their attention. The first objective is to get them out to lunch or out to breakfast. Once we have that, the objective becomes get them into building so we can pitch them. Because once we pitch them, they're going to start to get interested. It's a very slow process. Let me just tell a story. First recently we were looking for a vice president of customer service. We wanted the best in the world. We had identified somebody named Tish Whitcraft who was, I mean this is a pretty big jump for her. At the time, she was managing support for 800 million customers. She was the chief customer officer at Yahoo. She ran all of support for every product worldwide. Delted with 80 million customer contacts a year and 800 million customers. How do we get her out and bring her to a company where there's 150 beta users to support them and be prepared for scalability? It's a drawn out process. I mean, you really have to get, spend the time. I brought Tish in for five, six, seven meetings, get them engaged, get them emotionally hooked. A lot of entrepreneurs make the mistake of giving an offer letter too soon. When you have an executive, you want to close that person, wait until they're ready to close. I've made this mistake before. You don't want to get into an auctioneer process where there's 10 of you and one of them. You don't want to be in that situation. Only give the offer letter once you've managed all of the risk and removed it all and they're ready to sign. Almost every one of my executives signs the offer letter on the spot. We know what numbers it takes to get them. We know what the risks are as long as we can meet the numbers and the risks are out of the way. We got them. So spend the time. Make sure when you give an offer letter that that person is going to sign pretty much on the spot. By the time they see the numbers, they're not going to join us because we're paying the most amount of money. Sure there's equity involved, but don't even get to numbers. Talk about numbers afterwards. They should be jumping up and down by the time that they get you. You get them an offer letter based on the opportunity and the company alone. At the individual level, we have employee number 15 with a full-time talent scout. His job is to sit on LinkedIn every day and every time we have a manager who needs an employee, they put a list of five companies. Where does this person come from? Our talent scouts job. We've got all the org charts for all the different companies. We go in and take very happy people out of companies. We're like a company wrecker. These are happy people. We go in, get the person, bring them in, same sort of tactic. It's a little easier to close the individual contributors. The more these people that you get going and you have them aligned to this vision, the easier it becomes. It's a bigger and bigger magnet. You can't always get the biggest fish at first, but as you start to establish that, you have a better tool for recruiting, which is they're among greatness. They know that. Organizational design. This is very important to get right at the beginning. It fosters clear communication, clear demarcation of responsibility and decision-making within your organization. Here's what ours looks like. And oftentimes, this is a function of the talent that you have. There are a couple of key points with this slide. First of all, product management is in the middle of everything. That's how it works in a healthy company. Everybody has ideas. How are products developed at our company? Well, product management controls the roadmap, controls exactly what's going to be built, and controls resources of engineering. They're driven by two things. The market, what the customers want, and the idea pool. There's millions of ideas at a startup. It's a very good idea as an idea. And every person in our company can contribute as part of the idea pool, whether it's the receptionist or the VP of engineering. Everybody can give it to our director of product management. He figures out what to build. Notice that engineering doesn't have to be in tune with the market. This is what you want in a healthy company. They trust that product management knows the customers, knows the market, that they don't have to figure out what feature to go first, or when do we develop this? The product management organization does that. You want to make sure that these expectations are set clear at the beginning of the company before people are hired so they know how they fit into the organization. Now we foster a very collaborative environment where people want to brainstorm. There's a lot of creative tension in the company, but at the end of the day, everybody knows what decisions belong to them. Everyone of these have clear demarcation points. Board construction. This is vital. If you get the wrong board, it can really hurt you. It starts with the VCs. When you're choosing a partner in the VC world, you want to find somebody. I mean, DFJ has a reputation for being very supportive, very pro-entrepreneur. That's exactly what you're looking for. You're going to go through ups. You're going to go through downs. It's not always going to be pretty. You want a VC who understands that. Who understands startups? Who understands that as long as you're trending in the right direction, no matter what, even if you have a bad month or a bad couple months or something bad happened, that you're going to get through it and you're going to survive and you can stick together as a board. In its very important, get experienced CEOs who have done companies like the one that you're building and face the sort of challenges you're going to challenge and put them on the board. Because they've seen it before and they're going to be invaluable. As an entrepreneur, you need to make sure that you establish relationships, personal relationships with every one of your board members. It's very important. As a board, you're going to have very difficult times, very fun times. You need to make sure that the rules are set, direct, open, honest communication as a board. It's not always the most comfortable conversation, but you've got to have it as a board. To have that board dynamic there is vital in having a healthy organization. You have very limited time as a board. You're going to have good, you're going to have bad, you're going to have ugly, get through the good, focus on the bad and the ugly. Because that's really the challenges you need to manage. We try to foster that culture throughout the entire organization. It's a safe environment to talk about the ugly. If you know about something that's going to slip the schedule two weeks or a month, it's okay to raise your hand and say, guys, we're not going to make this schedule. You need to manage the way it is, not the way you wish that it is. Alignment. Alignment's easy when you have a five person startup, maybe a ten person. Then at some point, people start to think that the company is doing, everybody thinks that it's doing something different. How do you maintain alignment and scale a company through 100 users, through a thousand people? What we do is everything is governed by a playbook. The playbook, the first thing that we have in the playbook, in the playbook is created every year at our leadership off site. The leadership off site is held at one of our board members' houses and we start with the vision. The vision doesn't come from me as the CEO. Sure, I have input into the vision, but so does everybody else. It's a shared vision among the leadership team. People will buy into something that they help create. Now when you're creating a vision, not a lot of startups have vision statements and it's vital to keep alignment as you scale. Our vision statement is right up front as you walk in the building and the vision statement can be anything you want. Where do you want to be in two years? Use your imagination. Use your imagination to picture. Whatever that picture is, imagine it as much detail as possible, get grouped by in that hey, here is where we can get as a leadership team. Once you have that by in, you build that vision, write it down. Now you're going to figure out how do we reach that vision. It might seem bold at first. Like wow, that's a long way off. How do we do that? What you do is we have a process for coming up with different strategic imperatives. We had six strategic imperatives in our playbook and every single person agreed that if we do all six of these strategic imperatives, hey, we've got to our vision. We did it. The strategic imperatives are kind of high level but lower level in the vision statement. We take strategic objectives and each strategic imperative is broken out in probably three or four strategic objectives. Everybody agrees that the strategic imperative is met once you've done the objectives. The next thing is you just do tasks. Each strategic objective has a set of tasks associated with it, with an owner, with a due date. At the end of the day, you have all the tasks necessary over the next two years. These are high level tasks. This isn't a functional micro management. This is high level stuff. In a leader owns the task with a due date. Now you have a self-managing system that gets you to your vision. Every week in my weekly staff meeting, I mean a five-year-old could manage the business once you set this up because it's red light, yellow light, green light on each task. You know the executives you have that are just killing it. They're superstars, green light, every single time. You know the ones that are pulling their way. It's not just me, it's them, and it's all of their peers. When it comes to time to do evaluations and reviews, it's very clear as to how people are doing. It also helps align the entire company because then you go, we have a war room. You put in the war room and everybody knows what everybody else is working on and how it fits into the big picture. It helps with motivation. Missires. This is going to happen. I've had my share of these and you know I've talked to a lot of very successful CEOs. Almost every single one of them says the biggest mistake they've ever made in their career is firing somebody too late, especially at the leadership level. If you hire the wrong executive, it's either, best case scenario, it costs maybe a million or two million dollars. The damage that they do is not always obvious, but trust me, it's there and it's big. At the worst, it kills the company. A lot of companies will die because of a bad hire at the executives level. When you identify that you have a bad executive and it's not necessarily that they're a bad person. They're wrong for the company, wrong for the vision and the playbook that you've established. They can't, that's not what they do. You got to move and you got to move quick and if you have a process like the playbook process in place, it becomes very easy communicating back to that person. You never want to surprise somebody by saying, hey, you're fired because in your head, you know, they're not doing a great job but you've never shared that. That's a horrible way to operate and you know, you got to praise publicly and criticize privately. You're going to have to have those discussions. Bring them in your office and say, hey, look, you know, this isn't going the way I thought it was going to be going. How do we improve this? And as long as you're open with your communication, it's a lot easier. But that's the biggest lesson I can offer is when you have a situation, you got to address it. If your gut says that this is wrong, guess what? It's wrong. You got to make a move. Don't rationalize the good part with all this baggage. You got to make a move and find somebody who's an A player. Building for scalability. This is easy. This is really, really easy. All you have to do here is put together a leadership team that can scale. If you've got a leadership team that can scale, you have a company that can scale. What does a scalable leadership team look like? It's pretty simple. I ask four questions to all executives and these are requirements. You don't meet these four. You can't become an executive at home. Number one, do you have startup experience? You have to have seen that before. Startups are a different beast. Big company experience. Do you know what that looks like? If you have startup and big company experience, you can bridge between the two. You can scale a startup into a big company. You know the difference. Only big company experience is probably not going to do that great as a first-time executive in a startup. With startup experience, there's no big company experience. It's probably going to do good up to a point in which case they might not be able to scale with the organization. The other two, you must have experienced a massive success. You need to know what that feels like. A fantastic executive staff that drives growth. You also have to have a massive failure on your resume. And the failure is important because if you get people that only have successes on their resume, they might have been lucky and just jumped on the right buses or they might have been fully responsible for it, but they've never felt gravity. As a startup, as a growing company, one that's going to scale, you're going to have gravity. You're going to have bad times. You're going to have times when you're almost running out of money. You're going to have to downside stuff like that. You have to be prepared for that. And if you have a seasoned executive staff that meets all four of those, you're built for scalability. The product development process. How do we develop products? I was at a startup that, you know, one of the reasons I'm so strict on the organizational design with engineering department, not having control of where the product goes, but instead goes through the product management department, is I was at a startup where the engineers chose what to build. And there was, you know, $300 plus million raised to build something that was super cool. The problem was nobody bought it at all after four years of building this thing. The product management role was to keep up with what the engineers were building so they could update the PRD and get it, you know, in tune with what was being built. The opposite of what is supposed to happen, okay? In our company, you know, in any company, if you want to be able to develop multiple products, you need to have a process. The requirements cannot change once they've been signed up by engineering. If engineering and product management has an agreement, that's the agreement. That's going to be the product. Now you're not going to be able to predict everything in the requirements. You're going to have to change something. There'll be something unanticipated. If it's 1% difference or 10% difference, you're never going to nail it 100%. You need to make sure that there's a nice creative tension between your engineering and product management department. The engineering guys want to do a fantastic job, but the product management guys have to be a thorn in the side. They have to say, look, I need higher quality. I need, you know, better quality audio on this. I need this. I need that. You want that creative tension. When setting up a product development process like this allows you to do multiple products. Then you can expand your engineering organization. You can expand your product management organization and bifurcate between service and hardware or any sort of split that you want to do. Intellectual capital. People ask, what are your marketing budgets? I say, we have infinite capital to market. They say, what do you mean infinite capital? We have infinite intellectual capital. Marketing these days is an intellectual exercise. You see companies go out and think of subscriber acquisition and marketing as just a function of how much money do you have. You can do that, but it's unleveraged. You can sit there and spend $203 million on marketing campaigns per year, but then you see other creative startups that come out, get way bigger visibility, way bigger product success, and they have very little marketing budget spent. Intellectual capital examples are stuff like introducing a product which was designed to be viral. Putting virality into the product so it becomes self-propagating once you release it. Network effects are a fantastic example of an actual capital. PR is a very leveraged form of capital, especially if you can come up with new types of PR strategies and campaigns, then aren't your typical press release or whatever else. That stuff doesn't work as well as coming up with a creative strategy. You guys will see the Uma. We have a projected estimate of $20 to $25 million with a PR exposure. We're going to get over the summer through a creative version of an invite a friend type thing. We have a hardware device, but we have a creative version where it's self-propagating and it has an invite a friend component. We're going to couple that and activate it through a creative PR strategy which you guys will start to see in the press sometime very soon and that's just our version of intellectual capital. Mentorship. Very important, both giving and receiving. There's a lot of ways to skin the cat as a great leader. Lot of different styles that are successful. I chose to get a CEO mentor pretty early on when I said, why don't I just have somebody in my life that's been through all this stuff before that can ask questions to that's not necessarily on my board of directors or whose sole obligation is to make me successful. I got a guy named Keith Crock. Keith Crock had a fantastic career. He was the youngest vice president in the history of general motors. He ran the robotics division when he was 26 straight out of Harvard Business School. Did a couple of companies that he sold for huge amounts of money and then started a company called Ariba. He was a founder and CEO of Ariba. Within a few years he drove the valuation to $36 billion which was pretty remarkable in pioneering a whole new type of industry. He's a fantastic leader and a great mentor to me. I saw him speak at a conference and I basically begged him to be my lead. He's a very busy guy jetting all over the world but I encourage everybody here to find a mentor as well if you're starting a company find somebody who's done that and you can't always get their attention at first but just keep asking. If they see you're passionate you got a great idea you're enthusiastic eventually they're going to crack. I promise you that. Keith told me that he had his own mentor and he felt obligated to pass it on. His mentor was John Chambers and he had helped Keith a lot at Ariba and other places. This is just we're in Silicon Valley. The resources are out there. The best people in the world are within a 10 mile radius. Find those people, team up with those people, have those conversations with them and the almond flip side pass it on. When you have people who come into the company especially your team you got to mentor them. It's a give out of receive. This is a very important thing to take serious. Andrew, thanks for your comments. They're hiring. About 15 minutes ago he said something about a five year old can run the organization. If there's any five year olds in the audience, I'm just hiring right now. What did you decide and great amazing lessons that Andrew's learned, he relays here. What you also saw was the articulation of a great entrepreneur. When entrepreneurs come into DFJ I would say that 75% of our decision process involves assessing entrepreneur. What you saw right there, some of you can pick up on all these lessons and leverage everyone that's out in the Silicon Valley area is absolutely crucial. The greatest thing about Silicon Valley is how much sharing of ideas they're out and how open people are. It's this whole ecosystem that feeds on each other and that's why so many startups come out of here. One other thing though that we noticed that Dray Pratisha Jervitsen is that entrepreneurs like Andrew, they are everywhere in the world. You might have a great ecosystem here in Silicon Valley that's second to none but at the same time entrepreneurship can sprout up absolutely anywhere in the world. What we've done over the past is starting in 95 we started expanding with affiliate funds around the country and starting in 2000 with the different offices around the world. As we've started identifying entrepreneurs in basically whatever country that person is coming from so they can start a company, we can fund a company in that country and start building up an ecosystem like Silicon Valley elsewhere in the world so we can have more centers of entrepreneurship. We just announced funds in a fund in Brazil, a fund in Vietnam. We've been investing in China and India for quite some time now. Entrepreneurship can occur anywhere and it starts with the individual and it's these lessons which are so crucial to the startup and typically an entrepreneur doesn't start out knowing those things. Going to your last point about mentorship, I mean mentorship is absolutely crucial. Finding somebody like a Keith Crock or getting someone on the board of directors like a Mike Ramsey partnering with venture capital firms that have that knowledge that they can pass along that whole it all feeds into the ecosystem. To continue the Q&A a bit I thought maybe we would roll back to the beginning a little bit because one of the things I was curious about is you were in some large companies, you were in a startup company but you had some ideas of your own and I suspect in the audience here and out in television land and blog land, the blogosphere, there's lots of people with ideas and they're thinking how in the world do I know when it's right to strike out and strike out of my own? When should I actually start that company? When you were ideating how did you come up with the concept for Uma and then how did you know now is the right time to branch off it's time to get started? It's funny because it seems like it seems to occur over such a long period. It's not just like a snap I've got the idea it's fully evolved it's ready to go let me go raise money. It's an evolution. I mean I think I'm not exactly sure but most entrepreneurs that I talk to the idea started as something very lame, something very boring, a horrible idea almost and you evolve it. What you do is you take it and you evolve it and you have a bunch of ideas you'll throw them against the wall something will stick it'll evolve it even more and you just keep figuring it out and figuring out and put these little building blocks in place and that's kind of what we did is you know I focused first of all on the market and then we had the the base case for what we were doing which is it was a very disruptive concept but it had a lot of holes in it and we were trying to raise money and everybody kept pointing at the holes. When an venture capitalist continues to poke holes in the same spot that means go address it and it might seem impossible or you might be defensive about it but you really do have to use that as sort of a market gauge to figure out where to strengthen your pitch and you know we've gone through many many iterations of the product and the pitch all based on the same core technology but just different sequences of evolution and you know it wasn't necessary it's not like an instantaneous thing where you just go out and raise money. I mean our first round it was a six and a half million dollar round but it took you over a year to raise it and that's the process you just got to stick with it and people are going to tell you you know this will never work just stick with it keep on hardening it and put that time in and eventually good things are going to happen. Yeah and I'll expand on that. Another great entrepreneur that I've had the pleasure to work with is a guy named Mike Cassidy who started three companies his last company was called X-FIRE. Many of you or PC gamers might know it because it's a social network and instant messaging client for gamers. When he pitched the original idea to us it was a company called Ultimate Arena and the ideas with these you know folks were playing Counter Strike and Unreal Tournament Online and you know here to be a way to actually put your money where you're mouth is you know I'll play you you know if I frag you I get a buck that kind of he was going to set up this whole monetary system for people you know you can you know plan line you can't cheat you know they were going to manage all that in any event it was a great idea except for the fact that the best PC gamers basically stalked the site they just waited for any innocent person to throw up the site they kill them and they collect their money you know if you're the innocent bystander or at least the the newbie you wouldn't come back because it was pretty frustrating because PC gaming is actually a skillful experience not just luck in any event what they did is they figured out that this wasn't going to scale but they figured out they had an asset and the asset were these great gamers who loved Ultimate Arena of course they were making a lot of money on it so they flipped it on its head and instead of saying great gamers want to play against these amateur gamers or beginning gamers want to play with them so they created the social network the instant messaging client they created opportunities for these great gamers to show other gamers how to play the games and how to get better they created X fire and so here is an entrepreneur that wasn't just invested in this one idea called Ultimate Arena they were invested in an idea to make gaming experience better and that's what a great entrepreneur brings you and so when you're telling the anecdote about how you know it was something that the vision evolved over a period of time we were fortunate enough to invest in Uma after you've given it a lot of thought and it had matured to the point where it was a very robust idea and we're still carrying through on that idea Ultimate Arena on the other hand we started out early we brand some experiments if you will you know built the product launch the site and then we figured out it wasn't going to work and so instead of just you know folding up and saying forget it you know it's not going to work we recognize that the entrepreneur is really what makes these things saying and so redefine the business focus it on something that worked and everything worked out well so again another you know another anecdote that shows how important the power of entrepreneurship and creative open thinking is another question I had you mentioned recruiting early on and I was just you know given the importance of recruiting you know you start with you know yourself and then you've got to build a company around that what percentage of your time do you spend recruiting I mean you mentioned dinners and lunches and bringing back and forth and eventually you'll wear them out that kind of thing how much time do you spend recruiting probably 20 15 to 20 percent it has that evolved over time no it's it's pretty much been 15 to 20 percent and I don't know if it's going to slow down anytime I mean our executive staff is fully filled out so it might decrease to maybe 5 or 10 percent I interview we have about 60 employees right now I interview every single person that comes in and I ask the same sort of basic questions to kind of gauge them as a cultural fit not necessarily as a skill fit because that's already been done by the other people but I make sure that you know every single person that comes in meets a certain cultural standard so I do spend significant time on that and when you say they they fit a certain cultural standard how do you how do you assess that is that is that an artist or some science behind that you know it's probably both you want to get a really good feeling from the person you want to make sure that the person is hungry they understand the vision they're excited to work they're not going to look at this as a job and you want to make sure it's a driven person ask them what drives them that's a great question what drives you and you'll know if it's an authentic answer that comes from the heart or if it's or if it's not and you can just sort of ask these sort of touchy-feely questions and get a real sense for how this person is just as a person is this the warm person do you want this person in the culture are they well spoken are they articulate just all these basic things you know if it's an engineer coming in I'm not going to ask him a coding question that's been done they wouldn't be in my office if they weren't very skilled coder and so you know I have rejected people on occasion not very commonly on coming in because I just didn't think that they were going to be the right cultural fit maybe their answers had too much negativity in them you know they were disgruntled about the last three companies were big failures and everybody was idiots and all this other kind of stuff I mean you just don't want to hear that in in in an interview necessarily the negative side so so switching gears to marketing and you you spoke about intellectual capital and and leverage marketing kind of a softball question here but isn't it doesn't look appealing to take the venture capital dollars and throw it at marketing I mean you raise millions of dollars and there's you've got a message to deliver to the world and you know why not you know buy that Super Bowl ad or you know sponsor a TV show or get ads and lots of magazines things like isn't that appealing is that attractive you know I think it does feed the egos of certain you know CEOs that want to see themselves on TV it doesn't necessarily do the right things for the business actually I want to see myself on TV what they're board of directors on TV yeah um you know it's just it's just not it's to us it's not intellectual leveraged capital and we don't buy big ads we don't big do big advertising campaigns I mean we will spend money on SCM and we will spend money on PR and we might do limited very targeted very focused advertising but as far as just like blanket advertising we call brute force marketing we don't do that yeah I said it's a softball question because it's something near and dear to our our dfj about spending as little marketing dollars as possible I mentioned X fire X fire didn't spend a cent on marketing and it was just word of mouth they got it they basically leveraged all those great gamers to start talking up X fire and it started to pervade how many folks have used hotmail before they're pretty good cross section there so hotmail you know severe botia came into our our offices and had this idea for you know free web based email and and we went with that the the little tweak that we added to the equation was that it that whenever anybody sent an email right at the bottom it said get your free web based email at www.hotmail.com and at first the reaction of the company is like you can't do this you can't advertise in someone's private email that you know that you know forget it doesn't happen on the web but they you know we pushed a little bit more they got comfortable with it and it really was the the gem of the viral marketing scheme that made hotmail pervasive every single user of hotmail was an advocate for hotmail and there was that tacit approval for what hotmail was there was a tacit approval for you know that little tagline it was fairly innocuous no problem and people looked at then said gosh you know I can get this too I've got my work email maybe there's something else so that was a way of getting the marketing costs down extremely low so it's not just technology innovation that's critical here it's also marketing innovation it's channel innovation it's business model innovation so when you're thinking that you have the the greatest technology there think about all the other ways in which you can innovate and that's absolutely critical and I think while we can't get into too much of the details in umu there's a lot of innovation going on here and it stems way beyond the technology frontier so we've got about 15 minutes left or so so I think maybe it's time to open things up for Q&A you can ask Andrew myself the floor is open so we'll go over there you gave ten lessons most of them are people related we didn't talk so much about I mean I do have I have soon it's important um and also there is a lot of money going to so the question is for both there is a lot of money going to interrupt capital so you think that a bad idea with uh tremendous amounts of good people actually can work and the output is not true and uh with so much money going to provide with actually that's for you not to think that there is like a philitar model with people there everybody chasing like a lot of money so don't you think this is got a little crowded it's a little dangerous for the future of the model so that's as far as can a bad idea have great success if it's driven with the right resources and the right people if you're talking about the idea being the product is that right i mean if you have bad ideas across the board bad ideas for marketing bad ideas in the product i mean it's just a bunch of bad ideas it's not going anywhere so if you have a bad product it's not like super differentiated let's say you're going to enter a market that's very large in size with the same product that some big guy has with the right team that's very skilled very clever and can you know change the way that things are done across the business can they be successful i think absolutely i think absolutely you cannot execute the competition um but you it's bad product that has to be the limited extent of the badness yeah and i would say that you can start off with a bad idea and of course you don't know it at the time but a great team modifies and changes it and evolves and that's what's key and i guess at the at the margin you know if you have a great team and an okay idea versus an okay team and a great idea i'd rather be there with the great team because again they're going to evolve that okay idea into something that's great and again you know that's one of the great things about Silicon Valley is that not everything works there's so many variables that play out and whether something works or not and so you can have a great team and and the company just doesn't make it i would still back that team again in a second and there's just there's a great book by Jerry Kaplan called startup about Go Corporation and it's about a fantastic failure or pen based computing in the in the late 80s and that was a fantastic failure lots of money went into that company uh it might be soft you know basically was you know massively competitive took them out but the team was so good that they what what happened is that they all went on to greatness so even though that one venture didn't too great they hired great and they all went a bunch of those guys went on to uh be the early employees at net scape uh CEO of Intuit uh start uh a collaborate software that got bought by net scape i mean there's all sorts of stories that around if you take that graduating class of Go Corporation it just phenomenal success so uh again great teams make things happen the other part of your question to answer quickly is there too much money out there um in a way yes in a way no i mean i would never discourage money from going out and funding entrepreneurs because you never know a combination of ideas is going to work out well and you know it's a primordial soup of ideas that are out there and you look at eBay eBay early on you know selling beanie babies and uh you know i'm in evolving from that into an amazing ecosystem the fact that people have their whole profession surrounding buying and selling on eBay it's an amazing endeavor but early on if there wasn't a lot of capital maybe it wouldn't have gotten funded who knows if it would have gotten funded and the fact that there was so much money going into internet companies it was companies like eBay that did get funded and ultimately did were able to achieve the success they achieved uh you do have to be careful you don't want to overhype things you don't want to overfund things but the fact that an entrepreneur can get started uh because just simply because there's a lot there's excess capital out there that's a good thing certainly a good thing for entrepreneurs um i'm curious going back into recruiting and um as well as the timeline at the very beginning of companies at what point did you start holding in other people about your idea that you're like kind of refining it um and like how did exactly did you go about looking for there's initially you wanted to have business partner trade you know it's it the very early early stages it's best to work with people that you've met throughout your career that are just really really really talented because those are the people that are going to help you form the idea and construct it and evolve it and that's kind of what I did is I kind of reached out to people that I've worked at worked with at Cisco and places like that and brought them in and at first I mean you know the guy that runs product management now was at Cisco he was there for 10 years and when I first reached out to him he was still at Cisco and we were just bouncing ideas off each other he started off as an advisor and after like one year of just kind of working together finally he left and he was a distinguished engineer at Cisco which was a really big deal because we had to deal with all the you know counteroffers and all that kind of stuff but we got him out of there anyways and now he's running the product management group and so it's just you know connecting back to the best people you've ever worked with have them brainstorm with you and you know just one step at a time just talk to people keep talking to people nobody's going to steal your idea it's way too painful to go through the whole process it has to be your idea that you're passionate about taking it all the distance so don't be afraid to share it with people as if you know somebody else is going to go through that pain for you you talked about that having a bad part of that idea is sort of the benchmark you can get everything else good and you're okay sort of as a strong team and I wonder what values that depends on what value are you adding to society by successfully marketing do you want to take that? potentially no value whatsoever skills and you're able to gel and collaborate around you why not use it absolutely you're you're you should you market a good product that's the answer but that being said there are always products that get out on the market that have that are marginal value and but they don't that's right but there there's a couple of answers to this but I would say that they don't have they just don't win in the long run and you know our our key when we try to find a great opportunity to invest number one find the great entrepreneur but then number two find something of lasting value and that's absolutely critical as a venture capitalist my goal my end goal is supposed to be make as much money as fast as possible which doesn't sound like a very you know like there's better things to do with life but the key is the nice thing is there's an amazing alignment between doing something really great and really sustainable and making money so we don't set out to invest in companies that we just want to sell really quickly and leave somebody else holding the bag in every company that we fund we set out with the objective of taking the company public and making it a sustaining enterprise that's key to us and in order to do that in order to feel good about it you need to have a venture that is changing the world for the good that is does have a product that adds value and and soon enough you'll see that UMA is absolutely heading in that direction and you're early you talked about division and then the six I take the comparatives and then objectives and then tasks and having a color system that you can use we by week what's the software or infrastructure that you've got driving that system and where does that come from it's just Excel yeah I mean it's simple we don't need to put in place any fancy systems I mean these are just words and colors so you know I have my executive assistant that's always updating you know on a on a bigger picture level and then each individual leader updates their section so it's pretty simple to manage and it doesn't require a lot of maintenance from the team but you know we just keep it our philosophy just on a lot of things is just keep everything simple whether it's an employment agreement somebody's trying to negotiate something weird or put in some fancy software system to manage you know colors or whatever it is just keep it simple get the complexity out of the company where did you learn the idea actually going from vision to tasks and being do weekly meetings because I've not heard an entrepreneur talk is explicitly about that before and just wondered did you make did you make it up yourself remember lesson number 10 good mentorship right you can save a lot of time by talking to people who have been there and done that and so this was passed on to me and again we do it at our board members house that's where the off-site happens and he's there with us with the sleeves rolled up slow yes I'm just pretty to share both what drove you when you're a teenager and then hasn't changed much with time stop the videos please when I got out of prison it was great to be free which was interesting um wow things have changed I guess the one thing I can say is that for me at least life has been a random walk and I didn't wake up one day when I was 16 years old and say gosh I want to be a venture capitalist wouldn't that be cool I had no idea of adventure capital I had no idea what I wanted to do I I didn't know I wanted to come to Stanford and learn to surf and then I came to Stanford found out wasn't on the ocean which was broke my world um but uh you know for me actually that's a I hopefully a good answer because it'll show a contrast between us I'm an individual that loves to know a little bit about a lot of things and I always admire people who are really good at one thing because I always say god I wish I could do that I wish I could do it but I've got to be content not being that person because I just love knowing lots of little things and that's what is great about venture capital is that I get to meet entrepreneurs they get to teach me about what their company does and I get to get involved with markets as diverse as gaming and telephony to nanotechnology and semiconductor technology and communications equipment I mean it's incredibly diverse and I fuel I feed off that but the contrast are the entrepreneurs and the the entrepreneurs are incredibly focused and I use this as an answer because I have no idea where I it came to me to just like lots of little things but I've had to grow comfortable with that because that's who I am and I'm guessing that Andrew is the person who can be extremely I hope he's extremely focused he's doing one thing and it's called Luma but maybe he's got a different story of how he got to that focus yeah I'd say that there's definitely an element of truth to that the focus I've I've always been interested in I guess like systems how things work you know when I first joined Cisco it was like how do I get very very technical and understand routing extremely deep like down to the source code level I love that I love just the pursuit of knowledge and understanding the system I mean when you're starting the company understanding venture capital the psychology associated with it the process associated with it how to do it most effectively you know how to start a company how to recruit most effectively I'm just driven by just figuring sort of systems out and mastering systems I've always kind of been like that and I don't know it's probably a little bit of a contrast yeah I'm doing research on multi-cultures on Silicon Valley and essentially install a company that I was wondering what the ethnic demography of your company and whether based on your own personal reflection whether having an ethnic ethnically diverse management and makes a difference I think more every one of the initial employees I mean the diversity is great and so you just go for the folks that do the job best person for the job is is what we look for and you're going to get a mix bag you know the best people you know where they're going to come from or who they're going to be but you get to know them they're the right person and that's the person you end up building a relationship with question I'm speaking one of the questions that you ask about people is you know engage for how they as a startup how do you always want to pull speed or are there times where you can you can I mean you cannot red line there are moments to red line I mean we manage by impending event so it's like if we need something to get done it's like this is gotta be done by the board meeting I mean Warren when you walk around it's like there's a damn board member because you know the board ends up being the bad guy the board we need's coming up this has to be done and you want that race I mean when we come back and we have our set of deadlines there's always a race the last 30 days as you're hitting crunch time to get that done and as soon as you hit that people aren't going to be running at that same speed when you come back you're going to take a breather you know we definitely take care of people we celebrate every single victory and we celebrate it quick so if there's a big deadline and we hit it immediately like at the all hands like the next day all announced like all right guys you know we're having a big karaoke party it's in my place up in San Francisco we're bringing a bus up there it's gonna be full of alcohol and we do that everybody gets in a bus and drives a bus runs on alcohol to clean check fudge it is you guys thought something else did you and so you know you got to have fun keep it a very fun environment that people want to hit those deadlines they want to celebrate because you know you're gonna go through thickin thin as a team and you can't expect I mean people are people they're gonna want to slow down and you got to give them those breather to gear up for the next big milestone.
