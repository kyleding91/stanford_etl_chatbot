 Who you are defines how you build. This is the OddPattern thought leader series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. Today, I am so excited to welcome Dave Vassen to ETL. Dave is the founder and CEO of Brightwheel, the number one platform in early education and one of the fastest growing private SaaS companies. With Brightwheel, teachers say valuable time in the classroom, administrators can oversee the business and parents get a real-time view of their child's day. Brightwheel is the top-reviewed product in early education, a 175 billion US market. Throughout his career, Dave has been a passionate leader in education technology at companies including Amazon, Cisco, Teach for America, and he was a consultant with BAN and company as well. Dave is also a first-generation American. He holds a BA from Stanford University, class of 2003, and an MBA from the Wharton School. He lives with his wife and two daughters in the Bay Area. We're going to kickstart with a video and huge welcome to you, Dave. Thank you. Hi, sharks. My name is Dave Vassen. I'm the founder and CEO of Brightwheel. I'm here seeking a $400,000 investment for a 4% equity stake in my company. Brightwheel is the mobile app for preschools, daycares, and families. And we are completely revolutionizing early education. Now, I believe all of us are parents here. I don't want to ask. When you come home after a long day and you ask your kids, what did you learn in school today? Does this sound familiar? I get to attend every school in this country. I'm going to tell you. You're going to tell me? I don't know. This is the experience for millions of parents across America every single day, and especially for younger kids. You've been apart from your little human being for six, eight, ten hours a day, and that is all you get. You want to be a part of their day. You want to add to the running one to come home, and you can't. It's gut wrenching. On the other side, on the school side, there's no better. In addition to actually educating our kids, teachers are managing a ton of paperwork. Let's face it, they're actually managing parents. And on top of that, they're even running a business. The system is broken, and Brightwheel is the solution. So let's jump in and take a look at how Brightwheel works. So with Brightwheel, teachers can easily check kids in from the mobile app, picking log activities and assessments during the day. They can send quick updates, and they can even manage their business all in one place. And we're just seeing an amazing amount of photos every single day on Brightwheel. And this is the reason. You take it, you tag it, and you are absolutely done. And now we're going to look at the Teacher app. So this is the teacher's room, and we're going to click on activities at the bottom here. And this is all being done on paper today. And so we've taken it and combined it, made it super fast and super easy. And so we're going to click on NAP here, and then we're going to tag three kids that just went down for a nap. And the key about Brightwheel is the saving teacher's time. You actually have measurably more time with kids every single day. And now we're going to flip over real quick to the parent experience. So let's jump to the mobile app. This is actually my little girl, Serena. And this is her day. And as you can see, I get a sense of not only what she's doing, but what she's learning. And so when I come home, I can actually have a conversation with her about it. My connection with my little girl is so much deeper because of Brightwheel. And by the way, in the middle of a pretty tough day, it doesn't hurt to get a photo like this. Sharks, this is a unique opportunity to build a massive business that has a massive impact on people's everyday lives. And that's something that we hear every day. So I hope you're joining Serena and our team and bringing Brightwheel to every preschool, every daycare, and every family across the globe. Wasn't that cool? That was so cool. I watch that so many times, but I'm going to keep them all in suspense and not talk about Shark Tank until the very end. Deal. So let's start with actually how this all started, like the origin story. So you know, you've been interested in education since your days in Stanford and then to each for America and Amazon. And even when you weren't working directly in education, you still sort of carried the through line. And so you have a pretty special story about how this all got started. Would you be open to sharing with them? No, of course, yeah. For me, it does go way back. So personally, actually, it has relationships with my time here at Stanford. So both my parents are against. They came to the US, the very classic immigrant story. They kind of paid their way through school. We're able to get an education. Like literally my dad was washing dishes and the cafeteria to make their way through. So growing up, it was always very clear that education was their bedrock and they were our family. In a very real, very tangible way to have life that we had. So that was always their growing up. And then actually when I, I don't always share this part of it, but when I came here, literally my very first week on campus, I was in New New Bureau if anyone, if that speaks to anybody. And so very first week on campus, we have like our first dorm meeting. And I forget this. And like we had a guest come in. And it was a teacher from Teach for America who was already in Toronto. And she came in and basically just asked for help. And she actually got emotional in the moment, just saying that she was really struggling with these 4th and 5th graders who were in a tough spot. Now I, I, I, I, I, I gave myself, but back in like 1999, these probably was not what it is today. It was one of the worst zip codes in the US. And it was, it was really tough. And so I went out there, you know, that week and kind of every Friday over the next four years. And we saw were kids that were really truly heading, like in the wrong direction. And mainly through the work of their teacher, but this program that we held create, you saw like a complete change in the trajectory of their lives. And so for me, having experienced that in my life, having it seen it very real in there, is that the spark was there, like, how do you scale that? Where do you, how do you create that experience for, for ideally many, many more, not one to some, but one to many? And so I actually might see here, I created a piece of software to try to bring that to life, never launched it, horrible. Like it was in the, that was back in the day, like the dot com boom. And when software you thought could, could solve everything, classic like software in the world. But the spark was there. And so from my journey from there to Cisco to Amazon and everything between is always doing about whether it's the teacher, the parent, the child, how can tech be an enabler and a power and ideally something that creates scale for impact? Amazing, amazing. So you talked a little bit about fourth and fifth graders. So clearly you had already begun the discovery process, even, you know, while you were an undergrad. But you didn't start Brightwill until you had Serena and Toe. Right. She was an infant. A lot of people think, oh, it's being possible to get a startup going, like, with, like, an infant. I don't recommend it, generally, but yes. Yeah. But you did. And so like, what inspired you to take that on with Serena, you know, as, I don't know, 18 month old in your arms? Yeah. So at that point I had, like, sorry, at Cisco, I worked on online learning, one of the first kind of main online learning courses. At Amazon, I helped build the education team for Kindle, kind of taking that device to market. I even at one point worked on physical schools creating them. So I had attacked and looked at education in a bunch of different ways, mainly in the K-12 space. And so I think a lot of interest, investments, and just entrepreneurship ends up in that K-12 space, maybe in higher ed. And so I was at that moment in my career where then Serena shows up our first child. And I never thought about what happens before the K of K through 12. And so, you know, that traditionally starts at age five or six. In retrospect, it's very obvious that kids don't just show up ready to go at age five or six. But like, I had been zoned into that segment and never thought about what happens before. And when she showed up, I was the parent in charge of child care. And I started going very, very deep in our space. And I can tell you more about it. But for me, what was profound was just the impact that was there and the opportunity that was there. And so that was the pull. And it wasn't, again, I actually don't recommend starting a company with like a three, four or five month old at the time. It's not the easiest thing. But it was really inspired by her coming into our lives. Wow. Well, if somebody did have a three month old, any tips for them if they were to start to start off with that to the circumstance? I think going eyes wide open, I think both are going to pull you at different moments in different ways. And it's the early journey in particular, watching your neworship is really tough. So I don't think there's anything you can do to blunt that. I think it's just be ready for it probably. Okay. Well, be ready for it. You can do it with the three month old. So let's dive a little deeper in the discovery process. So as you were exploring, I understand that you were in the process of looking for child care for Serena because both you and your wife at that point were also working. What was that like? Like, what were the steps that you took to really understand the pre-case space? So for me, the first thing that was really compelling was just to understand how important it was. And again, I literally had just had blinders on or whatever it was to this part of the market. And realizing that when you look at the child, the first five years of development are arguably the most important five years of development in development. It became me. It's just so critical for in every way for certainly cognitive but physical emotional. Every type of development. Then you look at the family, as you mentioned, families need. And I felt this very viscerally. They need child care to go to work every day. It's the number one determinant when it's workforce participation. It's usually the biggest check the families are writing. It's either rent or child care. And depending on your zip code or number of kids, it's usually often child care. So it felt profound in terms of how important it was. And for me, it was just that pull of like, okay, I've been looking for impact. It's here. And what can I do? And the natural orientation for me was I'm a parent. I'm going to go out and solve a parent problem. And so that was my first orientation. And back then, this is 2014, I got a really great advice. Just go and try something. I think a lot of people toil, design, iterate, think for a long time, you know, in on their own. And I was on my hand at that point. I got a really great advice. Just go out there. And so I actually, early on in this journey, I was actually on parental leave for Serena. I started going out and it started just trying to get her into actually a child care space. And feeling the pain of that, I started growing, developing some parent related products. I quickly realized that I was off course. And I think being able to really quickly early talk to users. And in particular, who were going to be the determinants, the buyers, in this case it was the small business owners and the administrators and the teachers. They were interested in the parent problems, but that wasn't the biggest thing on their mind. It's like making parents happy actually wasn't the biggest thing that they needed to solve day to day. And so it was a quick pivot into, okay, what are your biggest challenges? And doing a lot of observing and listening and just asking. Not going in with any predispositions of, I know technology I can solve your problems, just asking, hey, what is most challenging for you? What's the most time consuming? What should you take one thing out of your day? What would it be? And having those conversations as well as just observing the workflows that they had, which honestly were pretty tough to observe. And really painful. These folks are even in the hub of Silicon Valley, even in the tech capital of the world, running on paper, more or less, paper checks, maybe like really old spreadsheets, horrible software, and kind of band-aing together these different systems. We benchmarked like 15 different tools that they're using to run their small business. And it's no different than a restaurant or a yoga studio or pick your small business. But this was one market that really had never had adequate tools. And really no one took a modern SaaS approach to saying, like, how do we solve those problems? And it was at a time when there was a trend toward just building more dedicated software for dedicated verticals. And it just happened to be that this was a very big one without, frankly, any real software. You know, you also pointed out, I think, in some of your other sort of talks that this space is also pretty regulated, which I wasn't aware about. It's mostly private business owners, if not all, and it's all regulated. Could you speak to that a little bit? Yeah, it's funny because I got to talk to other founders who are in healthcare or their transportation. And they're like budding up against, you know, like, if you think about the Airbnb or Uber's, like fighting regulation all the time, we love regulation. Like, we're like, you know, regulation. So, child care is highly regulated. And it's because the age of the kids, like, there's certain safety things you have to take into account. And it's very different, actually, than K-12. And so it's a small business and a child care licensing component. And they have to deal with that. And so every day they have to know physically where kids are. They have to know the ratios of teachers to students. If a kid scrapes their need, they have to look at that in a certain way. And the nice thing is, like, all of that was being done on paper, super laborers, like being saved in a file drawer for a year. Software can solve that in a really easy way. It can actually, like, make things a lot easier and more accessible. And so the fact that, like, we don't fight regulation, we don't mind it. Even, like, when COVID brought all these new regulations, we were able to quickly pivot and solve those. And so there's different relationships, I guess, to regulation for us. It was honestly an opportunity to solve a problem. Oh, that's awesome. That's awesome. And, you know, I also thought it was really interesting that, you know, for you, you were able to go in just to kind of highlight what you said and round it out. Like, you were able to go in and do research for inspiration. You actually went in with no sort of, like, agenda, right? And that was a big deal going to these folks, because you had discovered a lot of folks, I guess, or even maybe yourself. You went into, you know, in some of your earlier conversations, like, you're like, what if we solved it in this way? And they'd be like, no, no, no, that would make sense. But if you, like, asked to know a good end in question, they were like, oh, yeah, this is what I would do. And so, especially with, like, cash and checks, right? And so I really love your approach in doing the research to really sus out the problem before trying to build a product and sort of selling it. I appreciate that. I did the wrong way first to be clear. So, like, I went in there and I said, like, you don't have a mobile app. Would you use a mobile app? You know, you're literally going to the bank every Friday. Would you use all my making? And the answer consistently was no. And that was almost enough to determine. And I had plenty of people also just saying, stay away from this market. So, it was actually going about the wrong way in this stepping back and saying, but there has to be a way. Like, there has to be something here. And so then it was reverting and just saying, go down to, like, the first principles, fundamentals of what are the biggest pain points for these folks? And how could we solve that? And not having a perspective on it other than just being really, really curious and letting them guide me? Yeah. So, for all of these, those of you out there who want to start a business, right? It might actually benefit just to open up the question a little bit and reframe it a little bit to start with first principles and pain points. All right. Well, you started a company. It was just you. And then you started to add people to your team. And then you establish a mission of really connecting educators and parents and administrators so that, you know, the pre-case space could thrive and you're addressing all these pain points. You had that mission some seven, eight years ago. Has that evolved? Is that still true today? Or how has that developed over time? It's pretty consistent. I think that's nice for us. There are companies that will pivot in a completely different direction and become something else for us. I saw that there was a big important market and an opportunity to solve problems for those folks. And, you know, for us, our mission is now, which has evolved wording-wise a little bit, is high quality early education for every child. And we focus on the high quality piece of it and every child because we want to be everywhere and serve everyone. And to serve every constituent in the market. That piece hasn't changed. I think what we have evolved on step by step is what are the right tactics to get there. And it's a huge thing that we may never fully achieve. But, you know, how can we learn and iterate along the way and figure out strategy-wise tactics, execution? Like, what is the right for step to take towards that? And, you know, increasingly improve what we offer and increasingly bring that to more and more folks in our space. You know, the other part of it is the question that might come up is why not just use a generalizable platform? Like, why not use, you know, like, like, Microsoft Office to run the business or just, you know, turbo-taxed around the business. And you have a perspective on this with respect to going super deep in a vertical. Blind sharing that? Yeah, well, it's great. Like, right now, if anyone out there, like, six more things, there were so many people that tried to talk me out of this early on. And that was one of the things that said. Like, why would they, either why would they adopt technology in your space or why would they just use other tools, like QuickBooks or Microsoft or whatever it is? And, you know, in some cases, maybe the market is too small where it doesn't matter to solve that problem. But if the market is big enough solving a problem that is maybe small, but meaty, can be really meaningful. And the reality is trying to take QuickBooks or Square or anything else and adapt it to our market or even, you know, it's tools built for K through 12, it's really, really different. The way that they run their business, the way that they manage their staff, the way that they are regulated, we talked about all that's really, really unique. And so, I, you know, there's some things long way they've been very serenipitous. One was timing where there was this trend of the verbalization of SaaS, which is like every major market now has actually one or two multi-billion dollar companies that are just dedicated to offering really, really great SaaS for that space. And yes, you could maybe apply different tools, but the people in that space recognize that if I'm a restaurant, I want to buy something that's going to help me run my restaurant, right? And yoga studios, I mentioned, or if you're a contractor or a plumber, all of that. And so we actually, you know, we share investors with all the leaders of every major vertical. And it is actually just a strategy now, which is like go out and be the winning software for that space. Amazing. And I just think you can't actually fundamentally solve their problems. If they can't build parents, the way one will build parents, if they can't manage their staff or track immunizations, the way that they're meant to, you're not going to actually get very far with them. And our ability to speak to them and understand them is what, you know, enable us to get to the scale. It's amazing that you really spent time understanding the business model behind it, right? Before actually trying to apply, you know, a set of tools. Let's talk about parents since you brought them up. So, you know, parents and children, I mean, that's a really tricky space because it requires a deep sense of trust. You're, you know, working with data about, you know, their beloved children. And could you talk a little bit about like what you had to do to develop that sense of trust with your stakeholders, whether they're parents or administrators or educators or whatnot? Like, what was that process like? The part of it is like, I mentioned earlier, I came in as a parent originally, I'm a parent of a newborn and that's the perspective I took. It was really important to change that early and figure out who we're solving the problem for. And I do think a lot of startups get stuck trying to solve everything for everybody. And so early in our space, like there's 860,000 preschools in the US. So there's more preschools in the US than our restaurants to give you an idea. It's a massive market. So part of it is like, we can't go after the whole market. Where are we going to focus? And so let's focus on a certain segment. And then within that, let's figure out who we're building for and who's problems we're going to solve. And if we tried to solve the problem of the owner, administrator, teacher, and parent all at once, we truly wouldn't build anything, you know, a value for any of them. And so we actually, even for the most part, really just focused on within the school, the owner, the administrator, and now the teachers, how do we solve their problems? I was joking, actually, there's so many backstage who use the Brightwell. And I basically apologize because we haven't touched the parent app in like five years. And we just been really, really focused. Yeah, no, it's like embarrassing. I'm not very proud of that app. But it's been like hyper hyper focused. And I think a lot of people again get stuck trying to solve everything for us. It was like even now as a larger company, we still have very limited resources. Let's know what we're solving. Let's focus on that. Let's figure out how we're going to measure it. And I'm very excited about addressing parent needs over time. Thankfully, they've been happy with the experience that we give them and we're hyper hyper focused on the folks who are going to buy and use the software every day. Raise your hands if you are using Brightwell as a parent in the audience. See, you got some things. Hopefully, yeah. Hopefully, users. Hopefully, their fans. I don't know. Yeah, at least users. They're pretty sure their fans. So during the pandemic, it's conditions change. It was kind of interesting. Everybody was at home. Parents were with their children. Like, what was that period like for Brightwell and your users and your stakeholders? For us, as a company, and say, first of all, like we had already had three offices. So we'd be area Denver and Austin already. And so we had already figured out in some ways how to work across time zones and asynchronous, asynchronously. So in some ways, that transition was maybe less harder than companies who were all on a headquarters every single day. Still challenges in being fully remote and really scaling a company and doing all that and things we have to be really intentional about. On the customer side, it was really interesting because everything got really bad for a while. And our entire space shut down and there was a lot of fear there. And our belief was that things, the childcare ultimately is a fundamental need. It was classified early on as one of the core services that would need to be protected and reopened. As we talked about, you can't, people can't literally go to work if there is no childcare. And so our space was one of the first three open and there were regulations made to allow for that. And then, you know, there were a bunch of new things that they had to do. And for us, the ability to kind of quickly change our roadmap and say, we're going to solve these problems. So we launched a learning at home product for them. We launched COVID protocols. We launched a bunch of things to solve those specific problems. And it ended up being an accelerant for us. It was, you know, at a weird time when things were really hard. Our team took a lot of motivation to be able to solve these really, really tangible problems because businesses that left and right were going out of business. So our ability to really solve the fun amounts for these folks, help them reopen, help them run sustainably, help them with these new regulations. It was really an inspirational moment for our team and, you know, a moment of growth because we really could step up to that moment. Oh, that's amazing. Now that we're all going back to the office in the last year or so, parents who have been with their children, some, you know, their children don't know any other existence than them working from home, what has that been like? Now that parents and children are not sort of spending all their time together at home. For the company side, we've been always very open about it. The kids run across the Zoom screen. Like we're going to be very welcoming of that for our demographic and our type of work. And then what we saw is basically our space returned to full enrollment pretty quickly. There's some staffing shortages and some challenges there. But I think this, you know, there's always more need than supply in our space. And so the ability to go find a spot, get in and go through that process is frankly what it was before. And so in that way, there've been challenges and ups and downs through COVID for our space. But it's actually brought the attention to early education in a lot of ways. Like in many, like even in political spheres, early education is now talked about more than higher ed in K-12. And really shine the light. Because I think as you said, parents are feeling the pain. And I think there's a lot of empathy there. Like they're dealing with their kid all day long. They feel a lot more for the pre-school teacher, the child care worker who is like literally doing that work across many, many kids every day. Yeah, I've had colleagues here like, oh, my kids don't want to eat what I cook them anymore. Like I understand now what Pre-K was doing for my day to day. So thank you for that. Let's talk a little bit more about people. So we touched upon your staff during the pandemic. I think you have a very strong philosophy of how to build a team and how to hire, how to find great candidates that fit with bright real strategy and culture. Mind sharing a little bit about that. Of course, I'd say like for me, some big learnings are one, the biggest wins and misses for me have largely come back to people. And then, too, as you can have the most amazing idea, the biggest market, the best product whatever it is. But if you can't bring the right people around you to go and solve that, you're going to be on your own and never get to that point every time. So for me, like the importance of people was something I didn't fully appreciate when I got into this journey and figuring out really who we were going to be as a company. And both, you know, through our wins and the things that we're doing well as well as the times that we brought on folks who weren't a match, really taking those moments to be introspective and say like, who do we want to be? And I think I didn't fully appreciate until this experience that, you know, you have someone who really is excited and thrives at company A like Amazon. And then they go to Google and they hate it and they bounce back or vice versa or whatever. And each company rightly so is going to develop its own DNA that makes it successful. Understanding that actually defining it, reinforcing it, making sure it lives throughout the organization, particularly now being remote, is one of the most important things that I had to do today. And again, I didn't fully appreciate that. So, you know, whether it's values that we call them leadership principles, the things that make you super unique is a company that are going to allow you to achieve that huge vision, that huge mission. You have to be, faithfully, kind of uncompromising in those things and help people understand that. And one of the best things that we can do is in the interview process be very open because some people are going to come in and they're super excited about that. And some people are not and we'd rather be very open about that and then help people understand what we value in terms of their growth at Brightville. How do you test for that in an interview? It's tough because at this point now, like the standard thing is, oh, like let's look at your resume, let's look at your LinkedIn, whatever it is, it's a match, let's go. We put way less emphasis on that now. And so we really try to dig in and say, okay, like we have a leader's principle called think critically move fast. And so we're going to really probe and go deep on an example or give you a hypothetical and really figure out, are you a critical thinker? And at the same time, are you going to just sit and think? Or can you take action? We have a bias for action. You know, we have one that is focused on customers. And so we're going to understand how you value customers and bring that into your process. So we have literally, we have these eight leadership principles. We divvy them up amongst the interview group. We put scores against those. We debate them. If we don't get enough data, we go back and get more. And so it's being really, really direct. This is something I learned at Amazon, frankly, Amazon has 14 leadership principles. Everybody splits them up. You figure it out. And you really, again, are uncompromising. And like the bar is so hot. And you feel really great. By the time you get to hire somebody, they're really the right person for the right role. And so I, you know, in a more nimble, maybe start a way have brought that into bright will. That's awesome. That's awesome. Okay. Now we've made them wait for very long time. Let's talk about your tech. I'm an unconventional decision upon your part as a startup to decide to pitch SAS, SAS company on chart 10. Like maybe a little bit more about experience. Like what was it like meeting Mark Cuban? What was a light talking to Chris Saka? Like what happened? Yeah. I was first of all, I never thought I told you I got into this path very organically. Like I was, I've been pulled into this industry. And I wanted to solve problems. I never thought I would end up being on reality TV. So it was not like a path that I sought out or ever thought about at any point. It still feels honestly foreign to me to like look at that screen and see like myself up there. So it was very like serendipitous out all unfolded. But I wasn't intentional about it. And the reason I went and went to a live tryout with like my daughter Serena in my arm, which I think helped a lot, she was like a year plus at that point. And so like, you know, I want some hearts and minds in that moment and did a live tryout. It took the time and the time when we were like four people in the company really struggling. We had just launched. It was the worst time to go like invest a lot of time and trying to get on the shark tank. But when you think about our core audience of small business owners, preschool teachers, parents, there's a few places to go reach them in the way that we can through that medium. And so it was intentional. And it wasn't a re it was it was about bright will wasn't about trying to get on reality TV. But for me, it was a really eye opening experience. They take it very seriously. So when you say like, what was it like meeting Mark Cuban or Chris Acha? When I walked out on that carpet, they had no idea who I was. And you know, nothing about me. They weren't allowed to. And I've heard that people even got kicked off the show if they tried to create contact before. So like, it's completely cold. It's a long pitch. Like that was the whole thing was 12 minutes of screen time. I was out there for about an hour and a half under like very, very hot lights answering questions like down to like what payment processor do you use on your on your back end? So it was like it was very real number of ways they went into diligence afterward. So I was really impressed with like the realness of it. And then certainly has been really great for us to tell our story over time. To our customers were schools to employees, you know, who'd want to look at bright will. They did a really nice job of kind of patching it, packaging it in a way where we got to show who we are on Friday night ABC prime time. It's amazing. It's amazing. Any tips or folks out here who might want to go the shark tank round? I first of all know like it's a serious investment if you actually think about it. Like I didn't appreciate. I was like, oh, I'll go to this try out with my daughter. And then we'll, you know, I'll go to Hollywood. If I get there, they were like 20 rounds of like, you got to the first one. They fill out a 60 70 page handwritten essay. You can't, you know, they really are trying to leave people out. And then like 15 different video tryouts. Finally, you get there. And then they still tell you that they're going to cut 30% of the people who actually get who film. So no, no, it's a, it's a cute in my the entire time. My, my team is like like our founder is like off doing this stuff. Like why aren't you with us? Like they were questioning me a lot. Obviously during that time because it was a very expensive time to be investing that. So just know that it's, they take it seriously. It's a huge investment. If it works out, it can be great. And I've helped folks since then who've gotten that opportunity to go on. Wow. Thank you for that backstage glimpse. That was pretty fun. Yeah. Okay. Final question. And we're going to open up for questions on zoom as well as the audience here in person. So at one point, many moons ago, you were sitting in these seats. If you could go back to that sort of first week freshman orientation at Stanford in 1999. And you could channel a piece of advice or some wisdom to young Dave. What would that little bit of advice be? I won't take that as a knock against young Dave first of now. But, well, part of it is, you know, for me, it was being there's some serendipity. I told you like literally allowing myself to go explore that first Friday and go over these palatas. So part of it is just take opportunities. And I think that would be the main thing is see got opportunities and take risks. Like I think the moments along the way that I challenged myself that I put myself, you know, outside of my comfort zone, whether it was on campus or off campus or traveling or taking a job, you know, whatever it might be, those are the moments when I most figured out what was possible. What I was capable of and what I wanted to go. And so seeking out risk in some manner, you know, thoughtful way, depending on your risk tolerance. But and seeking out opportunity and fully kind of wrapping your arms around it. I think that that's a big one. And then I guess for me, like, I mean, I know this is like an entrepreneurship course. My perspective coming into it is that it is there's a lot of spotlight on it that makes it seem very. It's all like rainbows and unicorns and it's all very sexy and it's all really great. I think there isn't a lot of attention given to just the grind of it. I think a lot of people get into it and they read the tech articles of all the funding that's obviously the narrative is changing a bit now. But there's a lot of emphasis on the big milestones, the big funding coming through the big wins. For out of these, like, it, you know, it really is tough. I think if you get into it for the wrong reasons, if your heart isn't in it or if you're not ready to sign up for a long journey, it's going to be really tough. And so I think folks need to go in eyes wide open that you're signing up, you know, if you make it for seven, 10 plus years through a lot of ups and downs, a lot of sacrifices along the way. Like whatever might be family friends, like pick your sacrifice, but I think the glorification sometimes of founders or startups can sometimes then surprise people when they actually get into it. No, I would admit I was surprised. And you are already prepared. Can you add thoughts to some of these things? Yeah, but I think just like how there's, it's unnatural. I think what startups do. It's unnatural. The ability to create something in the time in which they created it and often at the scale, which they created is abnormal. It's not, you know, and often I tell the team like we're creating. You know, and what we do in one year is what companies used to do in 15, right? And so I think to get through those hurdles, it has to be hard. Otherwise, everyone literally would do it and there would be a ton of bright wills. And so I think knowing going in that there are going to be challenges are going to be hurdles. You have to be willing to stick with it yet also know when to learn and change course and kind of be headstrong all the way that like you're doing it for the right reasons. All that is, yeah, it's just, it's hard. It's a grind. And so I think I would at least coach myself a little bit to now going in and then also maybe say don't do it when you have like a three month old that isn't fully sleep free yet. Because that, yeah, those first couple months were tough. So worth it. Oh, I know. Yeah, I wake up every day super grateful to get to do this. Like we are at a size and scale now, which is like incredibly rewarding. And like I tell the team literally when we grow and earn money. So when we add a new school, we make, we make the world a better place every school we add. We have a profound impact on all the constituents, even the community around that school. And so every time we put a dot on the map, we know, you know, the value of the work that we're doing. So we're running without question. Incredible. Definitely incredible. Well, let's open it up to the audience for some questions over there. Hi, thank you for interested talk. I'm Ethan. I got a PhD in the valley from Stanford. And in one of these talks, I met Elon Musk 20 years ago. What should you do this time? He gave the talk about the SpaceX. You can find it in YouTube. And there was less people than here. So probably you'll do much better. So the question is, why did you decide to go that route and know the traditional? I mean, a lot of people go the traditional route like in page 11, you were also attractive. What was the experience of it? I don't think it was any easier because 20 rounds was the money that you wanted to raise. So what made you go back around versus other rounds? So I just I did go the page more route to so I had already raised some funding before that. And so for me, it was really the value that shark tank uniquely brings, which is exposure. And you know, like I would say that the both more Cuban and Chris, I can have been far more helpful than I realized. They treated as a real venture investment. They're frankly very accessible. They check in regularly. They've kind of continued to invest over the years. So they, you know, it basically is is the value is just immense. Like when you think about it, this ABC prime time television, people are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars for a 30 second spot on, you know, during that show to show a commercial. I walked away with 600 and, and you know, and got a cup, you know, a good amount of time. So it really was that that opportunity to tell our story more than anything. And again, I probably undervalued that in some ways as well as undervalued, you know, the contributions that Mark and Chris and their teams would make over time. Yeah. They thank you very much for sharing your story as a fellow parent. I can definitely relate to doing a lot of things with a little child and home and just the general experience. My question is this. So it sounds like the idea was born around the product, right? First, because there was a need for this product for you as a parent and so forth. At what point as you were building the company, at what point did you transition from product focus to more kind of operationalizing it and building really the company and operations and healthy pipeline? Yeah. It's a really good question. So part of it, I would say it started with the pain of it. And so it was actually eye opening. In fact, I could feel it is really the pain that these folks felt day to day of managing a business and, you know, a preschool or a child care. Being highly regulated, managing staff and families, it was overwhelming. And I think I borrowed a phrase really on that we were going to be a pain killer, not a vitamin. And so figuring out, you know, like, I say, you know, forget to take the vitamin day to day, but when you need the pain killer, you're going to seek it out and use it every day. And so we wanted to solve that pain. So my starting point was just cataloging that and understanding that. And there are different ways that to go from there. There are people who build quietly for a long time and then launch something. And I decided that we were going to move really fast. I read a book early on called the Lean Startup that was really influential for me, which is get something out and iterate and learn. So we launched in 2015 with a free product, very basic. It doesn't do, you know, a fraction of what we do today. And we didn't charge for it. We actually lost money on every transaction, but we learned. And we learned all the time. And so when we eventually, you know, over the next two years, I figured out roughly what the business model was going to be, what people were roughly willing to pay and how we were going to kind of carve things out. We only launched a paid version of Brightwill, you know, which is the core of the company today, two years later in 2017. And so again, some people might wait and launch that, you know, a year or two in. And for me, it was, no, let's just get out there and, you know, earn some respect and some love, but learn every day through the product. And so, you know, different ways of going about it, but that's been kind of generally how we try to run the company. Hi, thank you for sharing. In the beginning of your talk, you mentioned that rather than like sitting and designing and kind of thinking about it, that someone told you to just go do it. Can you kind of describe what that step from like step zero to step one was like and kind of how that propel to you forward? Yeah, so I felt very blocked early on because it was a lot to go do and think about and solve in our space. So you have the business owner, the administrators, the teachers, the parents. And as I said, I actually was focusing on the parents first, wrongly. And started thinking, okay, I'm going to go build an app. I got to go figure something out. The best advice which I now, while freeing for free, I guess is just literally go test something. So I created a, I don't even know what it was on, but probably some PowerPoint slide or whatever and acted like I had a real product. And I went door to door and showed it and got feedback on it. And basically got beaten up through that process because it just people were like, that's fine, but not the thing. And if I had like toiled away and built that thing for a while, it would have been totally the wrong thing. And so quickly getting that feedback of this is not our biggest problem. Let's talk about what is. And I went back and built another fake thing. And at the time we called Kid Casa. And that was just a way to get to market quickly. I created that, I created, you know, list of seven needs, pick one and then put it on paper and said, okay, now we have this. What do you think of this? It's ready to go. Let's talk about like what you need for it. And then through that process was able to convince, you know, one eventually two small childcare providers in San Francisco, just a beta with me. And so then eventually just built with them. And so it was kind of iterative process to like figure it out until I had enough to know what I could build. Built a really, you know, not great early version of Kid Casa, but again, just continue to even to the last question just continue iterating and learning. Let's take a zoom question. So Mandy, if you want to read the top one. All right, most uploaded question on zoom. Can you elaborate a little more on the value added for teachers? Do you notice some kind of initial pushback from teachers? It seems to be more work overload for them. So it's actually coming in. I think there are really different approaches. I consider this ultimately a SaaS company. But when you look at education companies, there are a lot of folks that come in and say, look, we know better. We know how to solve your problems. We took a very different approach, which is what are your pain points? What are the most challenging things, whether you're administrator or teacher? And how do we solve that? And what are the things that we can do to solve that? And do it in a way that feels intuitive. And so like even to the early iterations, it was figuring out how quickly can we get that job done? There's a framework called work to be done or jobs to be done. How do we get that done as quickly and efficiently easily as possible to the point where they can pick it up and get the stuff done that they are doing anyway really, really easily. And so we don't come in and say, probably does an insane amount of things. We don't say do all these things. We say, take the things you're doing today. And we promise we'll make life easier and save you measurable time. And then earn their respect with that. And then over time, we get to do more and more for them. But we take a very teacher, educator, owner, centric view of we want to solve your problem, whatever that problem is, and do it in the best way possible. All right, you've been waiting so patiently. Yes, I know you mentioned the importance of hiring. And I was just curious if you'd speak a little bit about your first few hires, where people that you knew, like engineers or what was it that you started with for your first or your core founding team? Yeah, I did it the wrong way because I was I built up a group of folks up in Amazon that I got to know really well and built trust with them and then decided to relocate to the Bay Area to start a company with my wife. So at the time it was really starting fresh and really in that time, this is back in 2014, you really only worked with the people that you were physically around day to day. And I didn't have a great group of folks to bring in. And so, you know, it was really like putting out job postings at the time on angel list and saying, you know, I had some hope of like the mission that was peaked to people. And then really like literally mean people every single day and trying to convince them of it. And there were a couple early folks who were willing enough to take a gamble, you know, help that we had some funding really on. So it wasn't fully risky for them. But in particular, I think it spoke to people who wanted to do something meaningful, do something good. Like one of the very first engineers that I hired, he knew nothing about our space. He didn't really even care about it that much, but he wanted to do something good for the world. And he wanted to leave where he was to do that. And so we struck up a conversation around that, convinced him he stayed on for five years. But a lot of the early work to your question is like being the champion and the motivator and the person who can paint that vision enough so that you can get a couple of people around the table. And then, you know, once you get that core group, it becomes a lot easier. Okay. Hi. Thank you so much for sharing your story about working with students in East Palo, just as somebody who does the same. So given the long history of inequality and ed tech and how it can sometimes be something that really exacerbates existing inequalities. How is bright wheeler? How have you made bright wheel? Not something that's just for wealthy preschools. That's a great question. So there was a lot of skepticism I had early on, whether it was folks interested in impact or even investors, and they thought, oh, this is going to be a Silicon Valley wealthy preschool product that certain demographics will buy. And I felt confident enough early on that the pain that we were solving was going to be universal. And I had to test that, you know, throughout different markets, about the country and different demographics are at the country. And every round of funding that we've taken on has been really important to be to bring on an impact investor who actually is going to help us think about this and help hold us accountable. Hopefully you heard from me. It's been a big part of my life and my work. And so, you know, having them around the table is a part of it. And a part of it is just what we care about, what we prioritize. I think the main thing I can say now is bright wheels and literally if you took a paint can and like through it against the wall, we're in every type of school across the country, certainly all 50 states and global, but all types of schools, all pedagogies, all price points, all demographics. And some of the biggest impact that we have actually is in schools and disadvantaged areas where, you know, for them, it's actually less a question of funding. We're not a super expensive product. But the impact is outside because they don't have access usually to tools like this. And a big part of what we want to do is actually democratize really great tools. And so, in some cases, we have partnered like we serve a lot of nonprofit organizations and head starts where we work with them to discount in the right ways. But the really rewarding thing has been, you know, for us, we have kept price low in a number of ways and focused on the value that we add. And I really, you know, what we hear and what we see is that bright will really be successful to everybody and we're able to then measure the impact. And so, if you go into a tough area and you're able to save them measurable time, so we save up to an hour per staff member per day and give them time back to spend time with the kids or to even frankly just go home on time. And then if you're helping on the parent side as well, it has a huge impact and frankly an outsize impact in those types of scenarios. I know we have a few more questions, but I do have to bring it to a close. This was an amazing conversation. I learned so much about Ed Tech today. So, a couple of comments and then we're going to give them a huge round of applause. So, next week, we're going to have entrepreneurial thought later series again at 430 here. And our speaker will be Nikhil Viswanathan, who is the co-founder and CEO of Alchemy. So, comment learned about Web Tech, Web3. If you're curious about these talks, go to the Stanford e-Corner, e-corner.stanford.edu. You can find more talks going back 20, 30 years like us, you and I were here. We have a small bad. And there's podcasts, there's articles, there's much more content on entrepreneurship and engineering at Stanford. So, let's give David a huge round of applause and that's me too. Thank you. The entrepreneurial thought leader series is a Stanford e-corner, original production. The stories and lessons on Stanford e-corner are designed to help you find the courage and clarity to see and seize opportunities.
