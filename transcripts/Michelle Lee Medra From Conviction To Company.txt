 This is the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series brought to you by Stanford Equal. Welcome Stanford and broader communities to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader seminar here at Stanford University. ETL, as you all know, is a Stanford seminar for aspiring entrepreneurs and is presented by STVP, the Stanford Engineering Entrepreneurship Center and Basis, the Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students. I am Ravi Balani, a lecturer in the Management Science and Engineering Department at Stanford and the Director of Alchemist and Accelerator for Enterprise Startups. Today, we are thrilled to welcome Michelle Lee to ETL. This is a true full circle moment for Michelle. She was literally in your seats just like less than a decade ago. Michelle is the CEO and co-founder of Medra, which is building robots to accelerate scientific breakthroughs. The company enables scientists to automate lab tasks and focus on making groundbreaking scientific discoveries. Now Michelle was born and raised in Taiwan and then came to the United States for high school, which began a pattern in Michelle's life of jumping into new territories and completely excelling. From high school, she went on to come to Stanford and she's a cardinal three times over. She graduated in 2015 with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering and has an undergrad through herself into the robotics club, even though she didn't have any prior experience from high school in robots. She then goes on to get a master's degree in a completely different discipline at Stanford in mechanical engineering, and she graduates as a mayfield fellow in Talbate of High. And then while at Stanford, she also is doing internships at McKinsey, SpaceX, and Nvidia. And then goes to get a PhD at Stanford in the computer science lab in the mechanical engineering department as part of the Stanford AI lab. And literally in computer in her PhD program in her first year is the first time that she learns Python. And yet she completes her PhD in three years and then goes on to get a tenured faculty track position in computer science at NYU, a dream job for many, but she resigns from that dream job to go into yet another new domain of entrepreneurship, because she was so compelled by the conviction that she had around Medra. And so today we're going to explore those themes around conviction, deep tech to entrepreneurship, and understanding your path in life. And so with that, please welcome Michelle. So lots of ETL love for you, Michelle. Thank you so much for having me for that great introduction. And this totally feels surreal because like Robbie just said, I finished my PhD in 2021. So I have literally taken so many classes in that auditorium. So it feels really great to be back for ETL. Now I've taken ETL before too. So this is very exciting to be back. So as Robbie said, I'd love to kind of show, do a really quick presentation to just give a sense of where I have been and what measures all about. There will be robots involved. So that's why I think presentation mode just makes sense. So really quickly, let me just share my screen here so you can actually speak. So yeah, I, hey everyone, I'm Michelle. And I am a roboticist that is me in the Stanford AI lab. Just playing around with robots, which I love. As Robbie mentioned, I did my PhD in the computer science department at sale, even though my degree formally is a mechanical engineering. And if I had to describe my research during my PhD, it's really at the intersection of robotics, machine learning and computer vision. And for those who don't have like a robotics background, let me just show you an example of that, what that looks like. So this was a research project that I did where we taught this robot how to wipe a wipe board just by training it like with data, like just by saying, hey, can you train over and over in simulation to learn how to wipe things and we'll reward you if you're successful. And was able to kind of train them to then in the real world, if you guys want to see again, to be of the white, this white board directly from data. So I do want to kind of fast forward a little bit to at the end of my PhD to talk about a decision that I was making. So I want to transport you guys to 2021. I am wrapping up my PhD at Stanford and AI and I am offered to start my own robotics research lab with almost $1 million in funding to start our app. Which curiously is very similar to what some investors were offering if I wanted to start my own company. So I had a choice here to very different paths I can take on one hand is academia, which is a million dollars in funding, no strings attached and complete freedom to work on whatever I want to work on. So that's academia on the other hand, it's starting my own company. So I would get about three quarters of that funding compared to academia. So less money here in exchange for equity for this company. So screams attached with this money and I would probably have to dedicate the next decade of my life on one single problem. So no freedom to choose what I really want to do. But I would get one very exciting thing that really inspired me and that is scale and the chance to really impact and change lives. So on the one hand academic freedom and on the other hand, a chance to change lives at scale. So spoiler alert I'm here right now at ETL. So you know what choice I made. I chose scale and I found it. So medra is helping scientists and biologists with the same struggle and the same dilemma I faced in 2021, which is how do you take really impactful research and how do you scale it to something that can actually change lives. So I want to I want you guys to again imagine you're a scientist and then we many many of you guys are I want to imagine you're a biologist. You just made a major discovery in your lab that you can synthesize something called a mRNA, which can create proteins in a cell. But you don't have any proof how about how mRNA can actually be useful or maybe it can be turned into a drug. And the only way to get that proof is to do lots of experiments. It's pipetting. It's moving, you know, test tubes around. It's sorting your samples in eyes. It's more pipetting just over and over again. So when mRNA was synthesized in the labs in the 1980s, researchers were already dreaming of a therapeutic potential. But it took decades before mRNA could be commercialized into a vaccine. We all know very well the mRNA COVID vaccine. So almost 40 years from research breakthrough to scaled up impact that can actually change lives. So what if instead of asking are very brilliant and highly trained scientists instead of asking them to pipet day in day out. We could just automate it with robots. So let me just show you some examples of what our robots can do. Robots can run experiments overnight. Over weekends robots don't really get bored and tired of repetitive, menial tasks. Robots certainly don't get repetitive strain injury, which is like a real problem for biologists when they're pipetting day in day out. Robots can 10X experiment through put and accelerate our drug discovery process. And this potential extends beyond drugs to even plastic devouring microbes that can clean up our oceans. We can even have the robots to come up with new lag room neat, which can replace factory farms that's creating so much greenhouse gas. And maybe even combat really complex diseases and mechanisms like aging and be able to work on really exciting work in longevity. So I just want like the thing that I want you to imagine is if every biotech and farmer company out there had 10 or even 20 of these metro robots doing experiments for them and generating data. If scientists can now just focus on science instead of the monotony of repetitive manual bench work. Imagine if the next generation of biotech companies, the future moderners of the world, we're going to create ground breaking medicine with our robots instead of taking four decades to come up with go from a research discovery to a real drug. It takes them a year. That's a scale that inspire me to start Medra in the first place. And that's the reason I chose this path that I am on right now. And that is to build robotics to accelerate scientific breakthroughs. And today I'm really excited to be having this fire site chat with Robbie and also talk to you guys about how you can also find your passion and convictions in life for you. It might not be scale. Maybe it's something else. Maybe it is doing fundamental scientific discovery in academia. But it's something that you have to choose for yourself. So that's a little bit more about me, a little bit more about Medra. And I'm excited to kind of go in and talk more about more things with Robbie and also with all of you. Thanks a lot. Thank you, Michelle. Michelle, that was very inspiring. I can understand why you're doing what you're doing. But I wanted to double click and dive in on this idea of actually building conviction towards an idea that you decide to dedicate your one precious life to. Just because I know all the students just like yourself have a flurry of options and it's one thing to conceptually understanding and inspiring an idea. And it's something to actually take action. And it's even another thing even more to take action when you're giving up such a treasured job that I think many people would have spent their lives pursuing to get a tenured track job in New York City in computer science. And so it's a different thing when you have to say no to that. So I wanted to first dive into really adding color on that inflection moment of decision where you're saying no and you're resigning from the job of the end of why you take your track job when you're saying yes to Medra. Can you give us more color on that was that a difficult time or was it pretty easy in your mind to make the decision and can you add more color on exactly what was happening in those moments and how you made the decision. That's those are great questions Robbie and I think for me when I made that decision it was not difficult but if you if you had to go back six months ago. I actually really struggled with with that decision I actually had a VC come to me because I they knew I had this tenured track job. And I basically had told NYU look I I want to start a company can I take a year before starting a company to to kind of to before start as a professor and so So six months before I actually made that decision to resign I actually had a VC tell me like why are you even trying to start a company while also trying to become a professor. And they had told me this thing which is like as a start of founder you should burn all bridges and burn all bridges behind you burn all ships so you have nowhere to go but to put ahead and so by having this option of becoming a professor that actually will make you less successful as a founder. And I really struggled with that because the truth was six months before I resigned from a faculty position I didn't have full conviction with what I was doing at medria I was still exploring. And so it took a while to gain that conviction took about six months of exposure to gain that conviction when I did once I did have that conviction. It was a very simple simple decision to make and I think that question of like how do we gain conviction is a better way of thinking of it than instead of framing it as optionality versus commitment. I think it's Silicon Valley there's a lot of this conversation against optionality and I think Peter field talks about how life is not a portfolio you know entrepreneur cannot diversify themselves but actually think optionality allows you to explore sometimes and explore different options. And if you're intentional about your exploration instead of just chasing out the optionality for the sake of actionality if you're intentional about the exploration you can actually use that as a way to gain conviction towards the path you want to take. And that was great and can we talk about though that moment when you actually got conviction in terms of what was the criteria or the necessary conditions for you to suddenly by narrowly shift and have conviction what and especially because I think many of you. And I think these students are wrestling with whether or not their idea is good enough to actually have a to and I think there's two convictions are sort of the conviction of time when you actually decide to focus your time on it and then there's the conviction where you know that the company is going to succeed and maybe we're not there yet but for that first conviction moment when you have after six months when you had the conviction to then dedicate your time what happened what unlocked at that moment to give you conviction. So I think the truth is conviction is going to look different for every single person. And so the question you have to ask yourself is what what is the thing that will make me feel conviction because that's going to look different I actually talked with another founder who said look I didn't really have conviction about what I'm building until I raised money. And again, these these might think oh well you should have a conviction about your idea because you believe in it but for her it was about the economic safety of it. So everyone's source of conviction is going to look different for me there were a couple of things the first was I wanted to work on something robotics related because I am passionate and just a total nerd about robots. So I knew that about myself the second thing though was I wanted to work on something where I knew it's going to have a huge impact and that's why I chose the space of biology which is what I explained earlier. But the third part was for me the conviction that I needed to see was people really desperately needed what I was going to build like it actually is going to make a difference there is a market here for what I'm going to build. And so for that for me drum we I actually sold a robotic system to a customer before I even started building the product I actually made a sales pitch deck I wanted and I wasn't trying to like pretend I had a product. I went out there very clearly saying to people I don't have a product yet I know what I need to build I know how to build it this is what I'm going to build I just want to know is this going to be helpful for you can you tell me. And a company said yes that would be very helpful in fact it would be so helpful we would love to work with you and sign a contract with you and that was the moment that convinced me wow that this is something I'm building that people actually want that they're willing to pay for it before I even started building anything I just have a PowerPoint presentation. So that was a thing that convinced me that's fantastic actually so I just want everybody to note that that the conviction moment happened when there's a couple of things that I wanted to do. But it was the measurement could have been just getting assigned contract not with even the product built but just the pain point and the vision validated with the sign contract the pain point in the vision before you even built the product. I have a bias on this I think you know you should never make a decision based on venture capitalists I do think it should come from internal or customers but they're fair enough on each to each each their own on coming up with conviction. But yeah that that's fantastic I want I know I'm going to have limited time Michelle there's lots that I want to discuss but one thing that I think you're just a singularity in is leveling up and then becoming an expert in completely new areas you know you shift from mechanical engineering to mechanical sorry chemical engineering to mechanical engineering. Then you start learning computer science in your first year of your PhD and you complete that in three years and then get a tenure track computer science faculty position and you have this history of going into new areas very quickly leveling up and then dominating share your secrets so spill for all the students that are scared about going into new areas and everybody who has imposter syndrome how do you go into a new area and level up and dominate so quickly. Hacks are great. So I definitely have a monster syndrome first of all and I think that is one thing that fuels me right it is acknowledging I'm a total beginner in something acknowledging that I don't know as much and just coming into a space with humility. I don't know anything and I'm here to learn my brother actually I when I was an undergrad actually took a product design class I think sophomore year and I have no design experience and I'm not very artistic and I remember telling my brother my older brother like I am like the worst person in this class I should be taking engineering class and I'm the design class I'm the worst person in class it feels so bad if you feel bad at something. And my brother actually told me when you're the worst person in a room you're going to learn the most and that's the kind of attitude I've always taken since then whenever I'm learning something new if I am the least knowledgeable person here in this room then I get to learn the most I get to grow the most. And so in terms of hacks really it's being honest with yourself and with others to like transparent like hey like I don't know much but I'm here to learn and I am willing to put in the effort to learn so when I started my PhD I would go to people and ask them how did you learn how to code is there anything I can do like what classes would you recommend I would be in lab Friday nights and on weekends right and I demonstrate that I'm not going to learn. And I demonstrate that I care deeply about learning and when people see that they want to help you they want to teach you and so it's just willingness to say I don't know but I want to grow and I'm can you help me grow and I think when people see that they actually just really do want to help. And did you ever have moments when you thought I'm just not cut out for this I made the wrong decision. Yeah I almost put my PhD when I was studying for my my calls as a PhD you have to pass your qualification exam which is a oral exam in front of professors that just ask you questions and I was doing my qualifying exams for mechanical engineering because that department I am but I actually did not take mechanical engineering as. And in undergrad so I was teaching myself a lot of the things that I needed to to know in order to pass the exams. There were definitely times that that that I felt like oh shoot and like am I in the right place but again it's this willingness to then say like okay. I do need to catch up with these I'm going to be honest with myself I'm maybe going to push back my calls a quarter later so I have more time to prepare and I'm going to dedicate this quarter to to really study for I'm going to form a study group around me so I have accountability. But there were definitely times I thought that I wanted like I wasn't cut out but then it's again not being not not being caught up on those feelings of inferiority or imposter but using that as like a using the curiosity like what can I learn here what can I grow here like it's okay if I fail like as long as you learn as long as I can become better that that's making that the motivation rather than like am I going to sit speed or not. That's fantastic by the way Sean anchor you know who's the Harvard researcher I think you would completely agree with you one of the things that we teach and that he teaches is that only 25% of your success as a function of your IQ 75% is your optimism your growth mindset and your social support so you know I think you're saying you're saying that all in spades which is terrific. I want to move now towards talking about deep tech entrepreneurship because it's so rare for us to have somebody who's so bold to go into hardware robots which are like oftentimes for letter these are the equivalent of for letter words that VCs have a religious aversion to for a variety of reasons and so I want to go through some of the pitfalls with doing a deep tech startup and get your your responses are advice you know before we talked about how the way that you got to conviction on your time. Was with customer validation as one point that a customer signed a contract just with the pain point and the vision without even the product being built many robotics companies start that way but then they end that way to they end is just consulting businesses where you basically find one customer a few customers that really need the product and because the margins are so low. And it becomes a services business that doesn't scale. Can you speak to that is that a valid concern and if so can you speak to your thoughts on that. Yeah so I think there are there are two pitfalls I see in a lot of robotics and deep tech companies the first is what you said which is how do you how do you actually avoid becoming just another basically venture subsidized consulting firm with really really smart people and really what I did was I looked at a lot of robotics companies some that succeed some that have failed and really work backwards why how did they fail and why did they fail and the key thing of why robotics companies I failed is because they can't they don't have a technology that can generalize. They can't actually scale up their technology if they want more people to use the system they basically have to hire more people to kind of do that consulting service. And so when I was thinking about like what can I build at Madra I the first thing I thought is like is this going to be scalable and generalizable and scalability and gelizability is not something you can get day one. It's something that you have to build technology towards but as a team in a company we have that in mind of like how can we actually scale up into something that is going to is going to be able to help you know if we have new customers it's going to take a very minimal amount of time to help them get set up with the new system. But I think a second pitfall I actually see from deep tech companies and robotics company is not starting out with wanting to just build the technology without knowing what problem you're actually trying to solve and maybe even building technology for the sake of building technology like wow wouldn't be so cool of the robot that can do dot dot dot rather than saying is this actually going to solve a problem that's out there. So for me finding that customer to say hey I actually really want this and using that as a north star of like hey we could build this. This product that the customers actually really want and really help them solve their problems that has really guided us. To be able to be able to actually build the right thing for our customers. Okay that's terrific. So one of the other I think quick sand moments for deep tech and hardware companies can be fundraising because oftentimes with software you can just use your own labor and build a software product that's very scalable easy to distribute the marginal cost of software is basically zero. But with hardware it's capital intensive and so you have oftentimes this conundrum where you're spending you need to spend all of your time building product that the build product need cash and then you're spending all of your time trying to get cash. But nobody's going to give you cash until they've de-risked the product and you never take off because of the capital intensity of that that fundraising product initial development cycle. Any thoughts on that on how to hack that or what founders who want to do hardware should think about which might be different than software founders. So fundamentally meadows actually a software business we're not actually a hardware business and again that goes back to that scalability question of like do we do when I started. Do I actually think what medra is doing can actually scale I think if you're building your own hardware it is a lot harder to scale because now you have to think about manufacturing and like you said the capital intensity intensity of that the reason why I think medra is a software businesses we actually use industrial robots are off the shelf. The secret weapon in the secret sauce of what we're building is not actually the physical hardware is the software that powers the robots and so we're using fairly commoditized industrial robots and we're actually using AI and computer vision and you know state of the art robot robotics to be able to power that robot and I think analogy I like to use here is like self driving. So if you're a car companies their magic sauce is not the car because they can just buy a car right and they can put it put you know cameras and lighters on it their magic sauce is the algorithm that allows the cars to be of the self drive and similarly at medra our magic sauce is the software and the algorithms and AI that powers our robots to be able to automate what what our customers want and so that is really what helps us become able to scale. Let me open it up now to the students. I'm Michelle thank you for joining us at the school of business I've noticed there are two different schools of thoughts around entrepreneurship some people have advocated that's important to build expertise first and then use that to find gaps and then you figure out kind of where to build a business to cover the gaps and others have advocated that hey if you have the conviction or interest you can build a team around you and you kind of learn kind of in the process you have other people to kind of supplement your knowledge. Where sort of your opinion on that spectrum and can you kind of in terms of starting a business and if you can share details why yeah. So I think there's something you know a lot of people talk about product market fit but there's also something called like the founder market fit and a question of why you so let's say I was someone without any robotics experience it would be pretty hard to start Metro because people will say why me now let's say I didn't have robotic experience but I had a great network and robotics like maybe I've worked at a robotic company as an operator right then there's a bit more of why me because I now have the necessary components and the competitive advantage to be able to recruit a great team around me. So I think that the main thing you would need to ask yourself is sure you can have that passion you can you can have that drive but you still need to create that competitive advantage and it might take a little bit more time and I think every market is going to be different now for me though also I I did go into robotics or at least the AI part of robotics as a fairly new beginner but I did then do a PhD. In it to become an expert in it I don't think I could have started Medra without having that expertise of the AI and computer vision so I think the question is like how can you create that founder market fit to make sure you are the best founder to be addressing this problem or building this product. Thank you Michelle next question. Thank you very much for your talk Michelle my question is what do you consider to be the most important characteristic and trade of an entrepreneur. That is such a good question. In my opinion it's the ability to learn and I'm biased because that is the thing that served me so well is the ability to to you know not know something but like that willingness and the resilience of saying let me become an expert in it. Prior to founding Medra I didn't have a lot of experience with recruiting for example and building a team but you have to when you become a founder to recruit a team around you to be of the build a product and so I was then able to just again ask people around me get lots of advice and surround myself with expertise and mentors to be able to learn how to do that. So if you're willing to learn willing to to to grow I think that's one of the best one of the best traits to have as a founder. And any tactics on learning that you want to share either books that you love or or or just general tactics that you use that that may be unintuitive that yeah. I think I'm very good at asking questions and finding the right people to ask them to and being very strategic about it so I did an internship at SpaceX where I had only at that time I I worked on projects in the robotics club and built like this electric go-cart. I was a team with a team but I'd only actually officially taken like two classes in mechanical engineer and those are mechanical engineering and internship and I just remember being like oh wow like there are a lot of things I don't know and it's probably going to be very difficult to figure it out all by myself and I basically made a list of like here all the people who are willing to help me here and have you know said hey they're willing to mentor me if I ask one person all my questions there are all the questions. I'm probably going to get really annoyed at me and they're probably going to think that like I'm not thinking for myself so I basically would think about what questions I should ask whom when should I ask them and also again demonstrate that I actually am willing to do the work I'm not just like every time I have a question I I won't even think about it I would actually do the work put in like half an hour an hour of work to really think through what the possibilities are and really formulate the right questions. I feel like I hit the wall I then go to to to someone in the company that's a mentor to be like hey can you can you help me with this and I think like talking with experts is one of the fastest way to learn but you have to first do that homework too you can't just show up to someone with a list of questions and kind of annoy them with it you have to show to them that you that you're worth investing their time into. And what if somebody says but I don't have a list of contacts I don't know a bunch of experts to go ask questions with how do I get that list. Yeah I think you need to do that research yourself right like say you wanted to go into robotics and you you you don't know you don't know how to go go search up or robotics professors around at Stanford that you could talk to if the professors aren't willing to talk to you who are their PhD students who have a lot more time on their hand make. Maybe and that maybe they're willing to talk to you maybe you can't do that go to someone's office hours so like really take it step by step to like build out that network. That's terrific that's great thank you Michelle next question gang. So Michelle it sounds like you've been really successful in terms of finding mentors and keeping up those relationships and I was just wondering if you had any advice as to how to keep those connections going long term and not just have them just a lot. That's that's a really great question actually think I actually sometimes struggle with that too and I don't think there's an easy solution to it I think in the end you have to if you want to build those relationships you also have to invest in those relationships but it's also also sometimes okay like totally open totally normal to like email someone after not having talked in the four of a while and say hey like I know we haven't spoken in months maybe you know what I'm saying. I've been here for years but like I really want to reconnect and here's what's going on with me and again like assuming that humble attitude of like like I wish I had reached out more but I didn't but here I am now trying to to to reconnect again. Michelle right now you give the example of that space X when you're trying to learn something mechanical and you're only taking two classes now you're in other deep you know new water this like entrepreneurship journey I don't know if there's things that you're struggling with right now that feel new but can you share real time like anything you know things that you're wrestling with and how you're using mentors or advisors or finding the support that you weren't necessarily trained in in the past to solve new issues that you're trying to deal with now. So I do think that like I said asking for help is really important but you have to show that you're doing that homework yourself and one thing that I really recommend folks just thinking about is this concept which. Has been very popularized by you on musk's idea of first principles thinking really like trying to understand a problem and thinking through the components first and doing that problem solving first to to then be able to come up with the solutions. I think also. I think that that serves me really well when I'm encountering a problem that I haven't faced before is to really try to like solve that problem out first and also the other part is really really embracing the scientific method and I might be a little bias here because you know I did do a PhD so. But and and that has served me incredibly well to as entrepreneur right thinking about what is your hypothesis and what are your assumptions and then being able to go out there to collect evidence empirical evidence to be able to test that hypothesis out there are a lot of things out there that honestly mentors and advisors cannot answer for you because it's actually has on to your situation it's so unique to you right and. Yes, advisors can kind of share. They're thinking about it you cannot as an entrepreneur take their bicycle sale and say let me apply that and so you do need to also think through again like the very hypothesis driven and. Be very empirical about how you solve that problem. That's great. I know that sounds very theoretical and I'm trying to think if I can I can come up with an example here. But maybe maybe you're having questions I can come back to that. Well, I might dive into this concept then of first principles is that is the idea then of this I think that's actually incredibly powerful because the truth is is that even there's going to be tons of people that are going to have advice when you're starting a company and you can also just get mentor with lash or advice with lash from people telling you lots of different things. But on this idea first principles is it the scientific method is it basically just articulating some basic premises of inputs that you think are driving an output and then testing that or or is there I don't know if there is an example you can. Is it like with are you dealing with that right now with hiring for example is that coming up with. Issues on the team or is there an example example we can show we can walk through on how you apply first principles. Okay, so so let's let's take the example of what should my team focus on right now. We in the beginning when we started working on these we had a customer so they told us exactly what we should be working on. Once we finish that customer then it's what's next right should we get another customer should we be doing R and D should we be building a B or C. And I think that first principle thinking is really thinking first about like what is that goal what is the goal you're trying to achieve here and really be able to work backwards from there so. Our goal is to create a product that scales and the product that someone that the customers truly want that really solves their problems right that's really our main goal is like we want if we I believe if we can solve customers problems then we're building something with value. Well then the question is how do we actually figure out what problems to be solving. Let's say we just signed a customer and we built for that customer but the question is like maybe that customer just had a very specific need that is not what every other customer wants right so then that that wouldn't be helpful. So if we really wanted to understand what's going to solve problems for a whole market and a whole field we have to go talk to people. And so I realized that actually instead of spending my time doing more engineering work and you know trying to to to maybe build for new customers or like building like what we think is would be really cool I just need to go out there and talk with scientists talk with biologists talk with founders of biotech companies and really understand like what what do you actually need and can we help you with that. And what should what should like if we if and maybe figuring out like are there clusters of things where we see there's a huge need and so we can really focus our time and energy on that. Another example here would be or Robbie I don't want to keep going these are great this is great it's like prompting all these other things might these are great so keep going yeah so another example is we now have customers that we've employed our systems and with every new product. Your it's the first time's MVP right the minimal viable product the first time people ever used it and so there's going to be problems with it right and so we're now like supporting our customers and trying to fix all the problems and a question comes up of like. What should we be focusing on should we again try to get another customer should we try to make it easier to have new customers or should we try to really support our current customers. And one tool that you can use when you're doing first principle thinking is to really think about things taken at extreme right like let's say we focused on on making it really fast to scale our product right now like so every new customer and maybe it takes like you know. Two weeks to be able to set up a new robot for them. We take it to the extreme right and say let's let's now deploy hundreds of robots every two weeks we're going to do a hundred robot but support actually takes us let's say 10 engineers right I'm just exaggerating here. Then our company absolutely cannot scale because just because it's fast we can have hundreds of robots out there but now for every robot we need 10 engineers to be able to support right. So taking that extreme it was very clear to us that as a team we actually needed to focus on support now and build out all that infrastructure for support to be able to help us scale our product. That's super helpful and I love the extreme example to that's really that makes it a lot more tangible. Michelle I'm curious because even that first thread kicked off in my head this dilemma that many founders that are trying to build ambitious change the world companies have which is on whether to go horizontal. In where you're really focusing first on building a modular extensible platform but when you do that investors will oftentimes say you need to focus or go vertical where your folks is going on a specific application. But then when you do that investors are going to say I don't know how big this gets you know it seems like it's a pretty niche product. How do you make that decision between a horizontal or vertical focus as your first move. I think in the end it depends on the market. I know that sounds super unsatisfying right but you have to really understand the market dynamics and there's no one size fits all answer. If I think like that's a question that we're thinking about should we focus on one specific protocol that the robot can do and just go after all farm on biotech companies and academic labs that do one specific protocol or should we be building the robot that is extensible, generalizable works with any protocol. And the truth is it depends right like if there are if we go out there we see actually yes there are one or two protocols that all those everyone's using and it's a huge bottleneck of huge pain point we should focus on those two. But we go out there and see it actually scientists actually are all kind of doing different things then then we have to we have to see that and say okay actually it's time to invest in building that generalizability of our system to be able to go after different protocols. You can also think of it as in steps right like maybe maybe we go after one protocol first it's not the the biggest market in the world but it allows us to actually start working with customers and focus and we use that as a wedge to to to keep going afterwards to learn about how we can generalize and we can build that generalizability as we work with more and more customers. So there are different ways to think about it and again there's no one size fits all you have to really understand the market dynamics and really understand what your goal is and work backwards from there to be able to achieve that goal. Fantastic. Thank you Michele for your talk it was indeed very inspiring. During the talk you spoke about longevity using robotics I want to know like how do you see that. For sure so you know Metro is a tool maker in essence our goal is to accelerate scientific progress by being to help scientists and biologists be able to speed up their speed of their research. What's so exciting about biology in my opinion is I think some of the biggest problems in the world right now and we solve the biology. I mean diseases in a very obvious one right with like if biologists are literally coming up with new vaccines and and and you care to diseases. But other areas where I see biology can make a huge impact as climate change is one because there's actually a lot of biotech companies that are working on new biofuels for example that can replace um replaced uh fossil fuels and longevity is an area where also there are a lot of very exciting companies that are founded by biologists or have wet labs are trying to uncover what what what are the mechanisms that make us age and how can we actually. uh be able to to to to change that right and so we're not actually working on longevity but we're empowering those companies and those scientists who want to work on longevity to be able to. um speed up their research and I believe we can like 10x the amount of research they can do right they're going to be able to 10x that speed. uh of coming up with a new cure or a new new new new drug or a new new bio fuel. Awesome. Oh so gang on that inspiring note we're going to draw the session of ETL 2A Close remember Medra if you don't know it today you'll know it soon um and gang everybody join me in thanking Michelle for sharing her experiences and insights with all of you our students and the Stanford's ETL course MSN e4 7v2 and our ETL viewers and listeners around the world. Next week gang we'll be joined by Sarah Lamy-Zone the co founder and CEO of dioxical and you can find that event and other future events in this ETL series on our Stanford eCorner YouTube channel and you'll find even more of our videos podcast and articles about entrepreneurship and innovation at Stanford eCorner that's eCorner. dot Stanford dot edu thank you everybody.
