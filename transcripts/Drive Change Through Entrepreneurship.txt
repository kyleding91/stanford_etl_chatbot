 You were listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader's series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. How privileged I feel to introduce Steve McCormick. I was introduced to him by my brother, Brooke, and I was just blown away seeing him talk about social innovation and social entrepreneurship. He spent the last six years at the Moore Foundation, which I hope we get to hear more about, a bad pun, but that's one of the top foundations or charities here in the United States, but it has incredible global reach. Six years before that, he was the leader of one of my favorite environmental groups, the Nature Conservancy. I can never say that properly. It's a tongue twister in Washington DC. But as usual, the bios are up on the web. We don't do a long extended intro, but I have to acknowledge with my own three degrees from Berkeley that he is a multi-degree person from UC Berkeley. So I thought I'd warm the crowd up by you, say, give me a C. C. You know, we got another one. Give me a. And I know you're going to do, give me an L. Okay, go bears. That's all I want to say. So, no, let's get this guy a warm, Stanford welcome. All right. Thank you very, very, very much. I could tell you that if I was at Cal and somebody tried to do that with a Stanford, they wouldn't get away with it. I mean, you're much more polite audience than at Berkeley. I very much appreciate the introduction, Tom, and really hope I can live up to it. I am delighted to be with a group of people who are so interested in entrepreneurialism in its kind of broadest manifestation. I have spent my whole career in the nonprofit sector. So I'm going to talk to you about what I think of as the application of being an entrepreneur in a nonprofit setting. And it's not easy. As Tom said, I was at the Nature Conservancy as president for almost eight years. Prior to that, I was working with the Nature Conservancy in California for 16 years. So I spent most of my career in the nonprofit sector at a more or less typical NGO, typical of a sense that it's dependent on private contributions, carries out a very focused mission. And employees people who have a deep passionate interest in that mission and have an alignment around that. I went to the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation in 2008, very beginning of 2008. And after having spent almost 30 years trying to raise money, going to a foundation that has $6 billion in assets, it was sort of like getting into the vault. I joked with people the first day I was there. I said, can I actually go look at the money? I mean, you've got to pile it up somewhere. But it's a sort of commonplace outlook in the NGO community that nothing could be easier than working at a foundation. It was very hard to raise money. And how hard could it be to give money away? There's some truth in that, but I'm going to share with you a lot of the lessons I've learned about the difficulty of giving money away. Although I will share with you an insight I had when I started there. Because again, coming from an organization with a $500 million operating budget at the Nature Conservancy, and then a need to raise at least that much in capital contributions every year. Because as many of you may know, the Nature Conservancy buys land. My biggest challenge, the thing that really kept me anxious, was getting that money in every year, raising enough money. And any nonprofit leader will tell you that. It's just like every year you're just fixated on getting enough money in. So when I started the foundation and asked folks, what causes anxiety here? What do you kind of like really get worried about? And the response was, oh man, at the end of the year, we've got to hit our 5% payout. That's not easy. So what you're telling me is you worry about getting money out the door. Yeah, that's unbelievable. That was a mindset that I hadn't anticipated. And actually was an insight into some of the challenges, frankly, of running a big foundation. So I'm going to share perspectives from both of those roles. And some things are very similar and some things are very distinct. But I'd say overall, managing a big enterprise in the nonprofit sector, in the for-profit sector, in the government sector has a lot of similarities. And I believe that one of the most important characteristics of leadership in the nonprofit sector is one of entrepreneurialism. And I'll explain what I mean by that. One of the biggest challenges in the nonprofit world is understanding how well you're doing. So in a for-profit, there are conventions consistently applied, universally understood, often legally required, that enable leadership or anybody in a large enterprise or smaller enterprise for that matter to know how well they're doing. And typically those are financial metrics. And in a nonprofit organization, you don't have any consistency in the metrics to determine success or progress towards admission. And frankly, one of the biggest shortcomings of nonprofit organizations is that they begin to think of success in terms of tactics and activities, not end results. I have an almost obsessive focus on outcomes. And I always have. I remember when I started at the Nature Conservancy, which again has been characterized by, I think, very successful tactic of buying land. I started there as a lawyer. And transactions were always in the pipeline negotiated by very able field representatives. Typically, who had a business degree, I started in 1977. It was 14 years old. Just I was really just more or less out of law school. But all these transactions, each one of which was a very fine consequence in its own right. I couldn't see how does it add up. How is this individual transaction contributing to some larger outcome? And as much as the mission of the Nature Conservancy used to preserve in essence, this is a little bit of simplification. The diversity of life on Earth, this seems like it would be a lot of transactions to get enough diversity of life on Earth to satisfy our mission. So I'd say in any enterprise that you go into large or small, if you're eye on the ball, what is this enterprise all about? What do I want to accomplish? And if I'm in a leadership role or if I'm in an entrepreneurial role, what is my compass head towards? What am I trying to get done? And it's so easy. Any of you who worked in any kind of enterprise realize day to day, the noise can distract you. And you lose sight. And I see that a lot in nonprofit organizations. How many of you have worked for a nonprofit, even as a volunteer? A lot of you. OK. So that means I can't lie too much about a lot of nonprofits. Catch me on that. But I think you'd agree. Anybody who's working on a nonprofit, that keeping your eye on the prize is a challenge. Again, because in part, it's hard to define what that prize is in ways that are simple, understandable, and measurable. Another challenge for nonprofit organizations is the candidly, the culture typically is one of consensus. And in part, I think that's attributable to the ethos, the mindset of like, OK, I have devoted my life to a cause, to a mission that is sort of sanctified by the nonprofit status bestowed by the government on this enterprise. And consciously or unconsciously, people in nonprofit organizations, I think, feel they're a little special because they've sacrificed to go work for a nonprofit to cause, the cause driven. And that is a very admirable characteristic. And it is quite true, people who work in nonprofit organizations obviously are there for the cause. And nonprofits typically don't pay as well as a for-profit if you could benchmark. And so almost unavoidably, or at least, I'd say, understandably, a culture of a nonprofit that very much is like, we're all in this together. And therefore, I want to make sure I get to touch every decision. And I want to make sure that I'm OK with every decision. And if I'm not OK with the decision, I sort of feel a sense of, you know, I have legitimacy in like, not aligning with that. My father started and through his whole life ran a very successful business, engineering business, in fact, God has degree at Cal. My father was a great small business leader at that time in the 50s and 60s. But he very much had the outlook that this is my business, my capital in this business, I get to make the decisions. And he was not autocratic, but he didn't tolerate a lot of, well, you know, I don't think I align with that. Is like, you're on the bus or you're off the bus. So nonprofit organizations are challenged by that kind of culture. And I don't say that dismissively or derisively, it's just the reality. So being an entrepreneur in that culture can be a bit of a challenge. Candidly, I've looked back on my now 35 year career and not for profit sector thing. You know, I'm not sure I really had the patience over all those years to deal with that sort of culture. And I've made a lot of mistakes because of that. Because you can't fight that, you've got to work with that. And in nonprofits, therefore, is kind of rare. And today, when we live in the VUCA world, VUCA, are you familiar with that? It comes out of the military. There's an enterprise nearby the Institute for the Future. Bob Johansson has done a lot of forecasting there. He uses that term to describe a volatile, uncertain, chaotic, ambiguous world, getting more so. And what's interesting to me is many respects Moore's Law. I'm going to put you on this. But anyone who's not familiar with Moore's Law, it's kind of embarrassing to say so. So Gordon Moore, founder of Intel, in 1965, wrote a paper in a now-long-gone professional journal that described his projection of how fast the speed of microparsices would grow over time and how the cost would come down and these were exponential curves. In 1965, 1965, in 1965, I was in eighth grade. I mean, we were still using slide rules. Gordon projected that in 25 years, virtually everybody could afford what, in essence, is a laptop computer, a personal phone, and a number of other things that would come as a result of the application of his law. The extraordinary thing is not only did it last for the period of time that he projected, it's still happening. And interestingly, Moore's Law has now become sort of popularized to generically describe the pace of change in society. So when I came to the foundation of this is great. I mean, Moore's Law, we ought to be able to think maybe there's more second law, how it would apply to the philanthropic sector than not for the profit sector. We move with speed. It's really challenging. So an entrepreneur in the not for profit field has to deal with the paradox of the world moving at a very fast pace, dealing with people who are devoted to a car they believe in it passionately, it's like oozes out of their pores. And yet, kind of stuck in a very consensus-oriented mindset. Now having said all that, I continue to believe very, very unequivocally that the not for profit sector, and I would say even more so, the philanthropic sector is in a position to drive major social change more so than any other sector in society. But I don't see it stepping up to that just yet. Now why do I say it can and why do I say that it's not yet? It can and I'm going to talk about the foundation community. Our foundation has $6 billion in assets by law. We are required to give out 5% of our asset wealth every year. We can give more, but by law we're required to give out at least 5%. So that's Stanford students, 5% of 6 billion is $400 million every year. So we turn a spigot on every year and $300 million comes gushing out and we can do anything we want with that as long as it's devoted to a philanthropic enterprise. Unbelievable. And I think we could burn it. And next year I turn that spigot on and another $300 million comes out. So I think, wow, if that's the case, I could burn that and I still have $300 million and if I want legally I could go into the $6 billion and use that. Why don't we shoot for the moon? Only a foundation or only will say private charity has the wherewithal and actually the legal ability to think about lasting forever. So we're set up in perpetuity. Maybe the Catholic Church is the only other thing, they can think in perpetuity. So you think, wow, that's incredible. We can last in perpetuity. We can live forever with $300 million coming out and today's valuation every year to do something great. Why wouldn't we reach for the stars? Interestingly, and I would say quite candidly, I think fundauses are among the most conservative actors in society. Why is that? I would assert because frankly, not enough people with entrepreneurial zeal, a passion for moving fast, for experimentation, for rapid prototyping, for taking risks and being willing to learn from it. Not enough of those kind of people are going to work for foundations. It would be a hugely contributory contribution to society. If all of you with your entrepreneurial backgrounds went to work foundation, you could change the world. And I don't mean to cast a spursion on the people who work in foundation, but typically foundations have hired people for academia or from NGOs. And wonderful people, the people who work at our foundation are fantastic people. Our foundation was built on Gordon Moore's belief that philanthropy should have a strong business orientation to it. Meaning keep your eye on the ball, take risks, but he built intel. Reach for the fences, that's Gordon's phrase, reach for the fences. We're the biggest funder of environmental conservation, which is why I came to the foundation, which is why I knew the foundation. This funder of environmental conservation, Gordon said at the inception of the foundation he wants to win in the environment rather than lose slowly. I love that. So here's an extraordinary generous man, comes out of a business background, says, okay, I want to do philanthropy, but I want to be viewed with the best principles of an entrepreneurial enterprise. And in that combination, I believe the key to solving, or at least addressing major social problems. Because I also think that today's social problems, you don't solve them, they're so complex, we're going to manage them. So foundation has the capability of staying with a really wicked problem for a very long time. Trying things, learning, adjusting, course correcting, learning, adapting in real time. And it has the ability to strike something really fast. When I was at the Nature Conservancy, if an opportunity came along that required significant funding, $10, $20 million, I'd have to go raise that money. And a lot of times the opportunity, if it was something that was presented, if we could do this, with the World Bank, we could drive a change that would completely reorient, say, the lending policy of the World Bank. But you need some fast mover money out there that was on the table to drive a slower, bigger international institution. Oh, God, you know, we can't do that. That couldn't do that at the Nature Conservancy. The foundation I can call up our Invest Chief Investment Officer. Nothing prevents me from saying, Denise, would you wire $20 million to this qualifying nonprofit? Yet, our foundation, like many, has encumbered itself with processes to move money out. And I have to tell you, is anybody here from the War Foundation? They could, they'll be, they may be watching us on the future. I say those, the greatest respect and the developed processes to move money out the door and they become an orthodox, an orthodoxy. So, wow, gosh, you know, takes six months to get money out the door. I've got to fill out these forms and we've got templates. That should be reviewed by lawyers, all imposed on ourselves. And it's hard to strip those things out. You think about it. Foundations have no incentive to change. There are no external influences that drive a for-profit to respond to changes in customer tastes or demand, supply chain perturbations, no external influences that drive a nonprofit organization to think about how it's soliciting, recruiting support. And none of the external influences in the form of a safe of legislature that a government agency has to deal with to make sure they get an appropriation every year. No external drivers that impose that sense of urgency and a need to change. I was talking with a consultant not long ago who is very well known for his work. He is engagement with big business actually in driving strategy very fast in a rapidly changing external environment. And I've heard him speak and I admire him. Normus, I've read his books and I said, yeah, I'd love to have you come help me think about how I could position our foundation not as a grant maker. Foundation think that they make grants. There's like this grant making machine, but as a change maker. I'm using all the assets of our enterprise, our name, the connections we have, the ability to move fast, the ability to stay with things for a long time. I'd love to have you help me position this foundation as like a whole new concept of philanthropy. You said, you know, I work with foundations and I'm not going to do it anymore because they don't want to change. So when I go to work with a CEO at a company large or small, I ask them, what are the three, maybe five things that you worry about in the next five years that could really disrupt your business? And they start there and then they work off of that and start thinking about, okay, looking ahead to have foresight to come back to insight so they can take action. He said, foundations, I ask him what they're worried about and it's like job security. It's internal things that they're concerned about. So we're at a point in society in this country when philanthropic dollars are increasing at a pace they never have before. We will see more money devoted to philanthropy in the next 10 to 15 years than we've seen in the last hundred. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett put a challenge out that you may have heard of called the Giving Pledge and they asked people of net worth of a billion dollars or more to make a public pledge that they would give away half of their wealth during their lifetime. And there are upwards of a hundred people who have signed up for that. A fair number in this community here. You may have seen that Mark Zuckerberg gave five hundred million dollars of Facebook stock to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation recently. And these are just examples. The amount of money going into either structured or directed philanthropy is increasing dramatically. So the opportunity for that funding to take on major social problems and drive major change and be a leader is more ripe than ever before. And we are beginning to see some very interesting shifts in how the new philanthropists think many again from this area. So you may have heard terms like strategic philanthropy or venture philanthropy, outcome-based philanthropy. But philanthropists thinking in terms of the eye on the prize, how am I going to measure results? How can I move fast? How can I rapid prototype? How can I learn fast? How can I fail fast? How can I take what eyes and entrepreneur have turned into something very successful in a private sector into the public sector? And so I think we're, as I say, at the threshold of a kind of a renaissance, a rethinking, reimagining of how philanthropy can work. And at the same time, we're seeing more nonprofit organizations that rely on that support, realizing that the characteristics, attributes, assets of those who are successful in enterprise management are imperative in the not-for-profit world. Not-for-profit world again has many people are drawn to, they have to cause deep in their gut. Non-profit leaders are often charismatic, most dangerously so sometimes, as we've seen, able to attract people to them and raise money, but not so good at making sure that that money is applied in a way that really is driving results. But we're starting to see more of that. And more business schools are seeing the expansion of what's called social enterprise in the business schools. And after all, you think about the future of business schools. I'm convinced that some days they won't, some day they won't be called business schools, well, maybe enterprise schools. Because the distinction between nonprofit organizations and for-profit organizations is going to blur. And I actually think that the not-for-profit sector could benefit enormously, as I said previously, from having people come in with really good leadership skills in all their dimensions, but also great management skills. Keeping their eye on the prize, measuring whether they're making progress and being willing to adapt. Now, in saying that, I will also put out a caution. Non-profits are not for-profits. It is very hard to measure results in a quantitative way in a not-for-profit organization. And as the adage goes, what you measure gets managed, if you put emphasis on things that are measurable. You actually may drive organizations to do things that aren't really adding up to the prize. Someone shared with me a little while ago, a guy named Mario Molino, who is a very successful investor, venture capitalist, who's got deeply involved in the art and science and practice of philanthropy. And as advocated for outcome-based philanthropy, you know, you do need to be careful. Because, as we saw in Vietnam, the measure was body count. You can count the number of bodies that were the result of a battle. And what happened? We lost in Vietnam. We drove all of the field leadership to think in terms of how many bodies that we get in that battle. And we're adding up bodies. But at the time, we were not-this country was not making progress in the political environment and the economic environment, the social environment in Vietnam. And I had no hope of winning in Vietnam. And the North Vietnamese were willing to keep putting bodies into the body count. Good example, but a sobering example, of measuring the wrong thing. So in a not-for-profit setting, measuring success will require much more nuance, much more subtle ways of assessing progress, more like gathering evidence for a legal case than it is sort of counting something. So that's one caution. Another caution is that, especially with the emergence of this new generation of philanthropists who have a very strong grounding in entrepreneurial driven enterprises, where they've been and ordinantly successful, generated a great deal of wealth. Frankly, figure they kind of know how to do almost anything. And see themselves as drivers of change, good thing, but also needed to help nonprofits be more sophisticated. And I'll tell you having worked, again, for a nonprofit organization, the temptation to change what you're focused on in order to get that money is too great. It's overpowering. So as I said, every year, I worried about raising enough money for the nature conservancy. We had a strategy driven towards our mission. We thought it was well conceived. We would sell that. And often I would encounter very wealthy people who would say, well, that's interesting. That's not what I'm interested in. I'm interested in this other thing. That was close enough. You know, I was just thinking about that myself. I think we're going to, you know, well, that's a really good idea. We're ready to go do that. And I will confess that more than once I was seduced into getting a big contribution, not thinking through the implications, actually ending up taking on more of a fundraising burden. It was one time when we were working with caterpillar corporation and they had a strong interest in watershed management. We didn't have a lot of experience in watershed management. We had bought land on river corridors. But watershed management is a much more complex undertaking. And, you know, having to understand users of water and issues like contamination of water, water rights. But caterpillar was really interested in that. They said, well, they'd be willing to put up $15 million. What did I hear? $15 million. So I said, yeah, you know, we were, that's where we're headed is watershed management. We're going to take all these properties that we bought. We're going to figure out, you know, work in a larger watershed. And we got into it and we realized this is at least a $50 million undertaking. This was on the Upper Mississippi River. It's not a small river. And you know, ended up kind of slogging through, but not really living up to what caterpillar wanted from us. So philanthropists as entrepreneurs need to be very thoughtful about the poll that they have on organizations and how they can very profoundly disorient or distract organizations from what they say is their mission. And it's very hard in a nonprofit organization where you're thinking from year to year how you're going to raise money to have a 10-year horizon. And it's very hard to have a three-year horizon. You're going to take on a project where we're going to stick with it for three, five, ten years, but I can only be confident in funding for the first few years. So I think one of the most important things in the coming five years is we see this flourishing of philanthropy and a very entrepreneurial driven philanthropy, which I think is terrific. I think it's going to be imperative that philanthropists understand the kinds of organizations that they are supporting. They're not for-profit enterprises. And that connection between the funder and the nonprofit will be exceedingly important. I'm sure have heard the term social entrepreneurs become, I say, quite the track of the attractive thing for foundations to support. And again, many cases, the foundations or the funders are people who have been entrepreneurs in the for-profit sector. I believe that an entrepreneur is an entrepreneur, whatever sector they're in. They could do anything. An entrepreneur's characterizing, again, my passion about getting something done moves with some pace and speed, willing to take risks, has high comfort for failure. That applies in any context, in any milieu, in any sector. The challenge, however, for a funder who's interested in supporting social entrepreneurs is that the notion of startup capital is very, very different in a not-for-profit setting, than it is in a for-profit setting. For-profit setting, you're betting on somebody who's going to get to a point where they can spin out a product or a service, something that has demand from buyers. And so the notion of startup is, I'm going to spin that flywheel by providing some funding. That roughly same philosophy has applied to social entrepreneurs. I'm going to find people who have a great idea, who show all of the characteristics and attributes of being a great entrepreneur. They're doing it for a social cause. I'm going to back that person with startup capital. And what happens is, more often than not, those social entrepreneurs have no other capital coming in. I know one funder who puts up $250,000 sort of per entrepreneur, a social entrepreneur, over a five-year period of time. With the expectation that within five years, or by that five-year horizon, the social entrepreneurs will figure out ways of raising other money. They think there aren't that many other sources of funding. Another consequence of that is it's tending to fragment people who are really, really talented when they should be aggregating. So you find people who are self-identifying as social entrepreneurs finding, and there's more and more sources of funding for social entrepreneurs going, is it making the case for me to do this thing? When in fact, they should be aggregating themselves. They say, well, why don't we work together and develop something that can get to critical mass, or can have sufficient scale to last forever. And I've seen really, really fine people move out of big nonprofit organizations to become a social entrepreneur because they like the idea of a startup when I would really encourage them to be a sort of positive deviant within their own organization. I was actually just talking to a funder the other day and asking, have you ever thought about doing that? Finding a big organization, whether it's established organization, YMCA, nature conservancy, care, that's got it installed, established presence. Big resources, but frankly, probably kind of plateaued on the yield curve a little bit. And you see that with big nonprofits. Have you ever thought about funding people in them to be an entrepreneur as the term used to be? Positive deviant, somebody who could have the backing of a funder to drive change in a big organization and take advantage of the entrepreneurial characteristics of some individuals, but the resource capacity of a big organization. I haven't seen that yet. I think that's a niche for funding in the not-for-profit sector. So as a way to maybe sort of wrap up and then I'd be very interested in your thoughts and your questions, I think that the issues in the, it's a little try to say, the world is so interconnected now that the problems are enormously challenging because they are global in so many ways. And yet because of that, they're also actually tractable. And the not-for-profit sector has become more sophisticated, is getting more sophisticated, is better prepared to take on those tractable problems. At the same time, there is this enormous infusion of wealth going into philanthropy. And so I really do look to the not-for-profit sector to step out in front and drive social change. The philanthropist shifting from a sense of charity, we bestow a grant on you. We would provide this award to you as a charitable beneficiary, as a grantee, and the terminology we use is condescending. Moving from being a charity to drivers of social change, working in true solidarity and collectivity with the organizations they support. So that the combined wealth that is emerging in this country can have far more influence collectively than it will separately, where that solidarity with the supported organizations creates a true sense of partnership and not an asymmetrical relationship of funder and grantee. And I really do believe that with the challenges we see in the political arena, with what I see as really an emerging and deep-seated understanding in more progressive elements of the for-profit sector, and especially again from my background and sustainability, we're seeing more and more big global companies realize that sustainability has a profound bottom line influence. We're seeing investors like Jeremy Grantham from Boston starting to point out that if we take the long view in investing, we better be looking at enterprises that are thinking where are they going to get their water, where are they going to get their timber resources, where are they going to get basic commodities 10, 15, 20 years from now. So there's a shift in the wind and international institutions slow, politically challenged, not stepping out in front, that there's a chance now for the not-for-profit sector, the philanthropic sector, working in tandem with the business community to take on huge, huge social problems. Each one bringing something that is unique in terms of its outlook, its resources, and its capabilities to address those problems. And I really do think we're on the threshold of a very, very exciting new era, but all those sectors will have to step up in ways they never have before, in ways that sort of put aside, again, their conventional thinking and their orthodoxies, and really try to step out of the mold, and we're seeing, I believe, some of the first signs of that. So I'm very, very, very hopeful. I see in this room people who I'm convinced that in one way or another, every one of you in this room, every one of you who's a student at this school, anyone who's under 25, basically, I'm saying, in 10, 15 years, in one way or another, we'll be working in some enterprise that is addressing major social change, whether it's a for-profit, government, or not-for-profit. And I hope in that 10 or 15 years, you will think back and say, you know, I got my corbic, it was kind of on the deal, it was like this a very different way of society working together in a vuka world. So the future is your hands. Don't fuck it up. See, that's how we talk at Berkeley. Questions, yes? Yes, so you talk about the incentives or the lack of incentives for nonprofits to actually be a lot more progressive or a lot more profit driven or be efficient. But actually, I'm just wondering, you know, the government really should be the one who ought to be, because we see a lot of, you know, asymmetrical information also divided community within the nonprofits, a lot of them are working on the same issues. And so actually, there's a project that I, and I'll few, few other students at Stanford were actually in another class in international policy studies. We actually are addressing issues through using, you know, government as the one to, because there's 600 billion, five to 600 billion dollars each year as grants money given to NGOs, but not necessarily knowing, you know, what everyone's doing. So we're just thinking, you know, maybe there should be some percentage of that money being given to NGOs with expectation of showing precisely how efficient or how effective that everyone's doing and given each American, you know, maybe a voucher, $50 or something, to locally vote for which NGOs are doing their job, depending on what, like, you know, their information knowing what these NGOs are doing. So do you think, like, maybe some possibility of working with the government and persuade them to take on some stability of actually coordinating or monitoring in some way to make NGOs to work better? And also, so let's, this is also a way for a lot of NGOs to have a free advertisement opportunity and also work closely with population who they need to address a lot of their good problems. So I hear what you're asking is, could, could, could, no, let's go. Let's like, let's go get it. Could, is there some opportunity to convince the government to create a way of understanding the efficiency and effectiveness of nonprofits? Well, I'm trying to say is, is that close enough? If it's not, it's a good question. Yeah, I think like organizations like Gates Foundation or your foundation can actually be put to persuade the US government or some other governments to actually make legal, create some legal ways of actually creating a systematic measurement of efficiency. Got it. So, at the risk of sounding flip, asking government to determine if nonprofits are efficient is probably not likely to happen. We have a big issue with whether government is efficient. But you're hitting on a really interesting point. How do you know if a nonprofit is effective? And that's a very, very hard thing for a donor to figure out. And if you're a modest donor, if you're giving $50 a year, you know, I spend a lot of time trying to figure, is this organization efficient? If you're a big donor like we are, we do a lot of due diligence on the organizations that we support. And we spend a lot of time with them. So I have two observations. One is, as I was perhaps a little elliptical way suggesting earlier, nonprofits are inherently inefficient. They're just not efficient. They're just not efficient. And unfortunately, there are rating services actually, Guide Star, Charity Navigator, the Better Business Bureau. They have rating services on the efficiency of nonprofit organizations. Typically, what they look at is, what's the percentage of the budget that goes to overhead and what goes to program? And so you think, well, that's probably a pretty good measure. It's not. And nonprofits figure out how, frankly, how to game that. There are ways you can classify certain expenditures that look like program. It's not illegal. It's just, you know, in recruiting members, you put out a lot of marketing materials. Is that marketing? Where is that advertising? I mean, is that promoting a cause, another way of putting it? So it's not, frankly, I don't think any of the rating services really give you an insight into efficiency. And in any event, I don't care about efficiency. We support organizations. They're incredibly inefficient. And if I spend a lot of time trying to help them be efficient, it's beside the point. They're incredibly effective. Could they do it at less money? Probably. Is it worth the time to try to make them do that? No. They're incredibly effective. There are no services that give you an insight into the effectiveness of organizations. And I have a guy who just left the Hewlett Foundation, who I have great, bright respect for, Jacob Herald, has just gone to be the CEO of charity navigator. And he, to his credit, is going to try to, crack that code. How could you create indices or insights into the effectiveness of organizations? But when you think about, again, the structure of how a nonprofit organization gets its revenue as opposed to a for-profit, a for-profit has to be constantly providing something that somebody wants to buy. They're a good or a service. And they can manipulate that, perhaps, by advertising. But still, consumers are making decisions. They're putting money out to get something. And they don't do that enterprise-gone. A nonprofit organization relies on a funder who's not a beneficiary. So funders putting money into the organization, for that organization to go benefit something. Nature, in the case of the nature-concerbency. So how do you go ask nature? Is the nature-concerbency, who's better than nature-concerbency? Is it a real wildlife fund or wildlife conservation internationally? It's very, very, very, very hard to make that determination. And it requires a lot of time, if you're a donor, it's a tease behind that. I do think one of the things we're going to see more of, and I think Jacob is at the forefront of that, are insights into the effectiveness of organizations, irrespective of their efficiency. Heidi. I have a related question around compensation. I think that when you go to a nonprofit, you're sort of presuming that you're taking the vow of poverty. And judging how these are rated, salaries are overhead. So it's sort of designed that way. And in Silicon Valley, we recognize that to get the best talent, sometimes we have to pay, there are markets for a great talent. And I'm just wondering, being in a foundation, so you're not having to constantly pass the donor tax. I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit about what your compensation philosophy is and how do you incentivize, besides the great work people know they're doing. There are people in Silicon Valley who think they're doing great work too, in for-profits, how do you incentivize your staff? Boy, that's a really question. So how do we at the foundation incentivize our staff in compensation? More like a nonprofit or something like that? Really good question. When I came to the foundation, again, in the spirit of Gordon's desire to create an enterprise that had sort of the best characteristics of a business and a nonprofit. We had a significant incentive pay element, significant for, I've never seen anything like it in anything other than a for-profit. But it doesn't work as well, not for profit organization, because again, you don't have a convention of metrics. If I have a sales force, I over time can establish pretty good understanding of what if somebody really puts their heart into it, works really hard. What a benchmark would be. What I could expect from an annual sales effort. And I'd reward somebody accordingly in a foundation. It's really hard because are the outcomes that we're trying to achieve for which we would be rewarded, a consequence of what we did or the organizations we support? So that's a huge complication. And then it creates a distortion around, frankly, near-term things. And it really diminishes and it pushed towards risk-taking and experimentation. So we did away with it. I have not seen in any not-for-profit organization, that is not a foundation, but a typical NGO. There are incentive elements to compensation that nowhere near like what we had at our foundation, and what we had at our foundation was nowhere near what you would have in a for-profit, in terms of the proportion of that annual incentive compensation. On the point of compensation overall and nonprofit organizations, it's really well taken, Heidi. I think leading a huge global enterprise like care is as challenging as a huge global enterprise like General Motors, more so in many ways. And yet it is the convention, and I don't see this changing at all, that nonprofit compensation is a fraction of for-profit compensation. In fact, the IRS will even look at whether, you know, all nonprofits have to file a 990 every year. It's basically their tax filing. That 990 has also become a disclosure document. So serving two purposes, and neither one of which is very well, but those 990, everybody looks at the 990s now because they have to show the top five compensated employees. So it's public information, and Congress keeps an eye on that, and the IRS keeps an eye on that. And that gets out into the donor space. I'll share with you, when I was at the Nature, this is a whole another story. This is a whole another hour story. When I was at the Nature Conservancy, here I've been in this, I'd grown up with the Nature Conservancy. It became president in 2000. When I started, our media people told me the Washington Post is working on an in-depth story about the Nature Conservancy. That was perfect. I come in as the CEO, do an in-depth story. I'll be the hero. They say, no, you don't understand. This is the investigative unit. So what? I mean, we're a great organization. Well, long, long, long, long, very complex story. In 2001, obviously, other things happened that we invaded Iraq. This three-part series came out in 2003. And it was like a hit in the solar plexus. It started above the fold on Sunday, which is when they started all their big stories. Went for three days, and it led to a Congress Senate Finance Committee investigated us. It had to do with transactions we'd done with people who'd been close to the Nature Conservancy and the assertion was, you know, we crossed the line of ethics if not crossed the line of the law. But I mean, they went into everything, including my compensation. And in 2003, I was paid $420,000. And it was like, can you believe? McCormick makes 400,000. And I got letters from I rate members saying, I can't believe that this level of sorry, you know, you dedicate your corporate influence is terrible. And I just think $420,000 is like, it's not that much. We've got 4,500 people spread around the world. And $500 million budget I got to raise every year. There's just a big backlash to high levels of compensation. Not for profit. Someday, that may change. I hope it does. End of story. I'm cleared by the Senate Finance Committee, you know, two years of rigorous examination. As I say, that's a whole other story. I put out there only to tell that story about the scrutiny of salaries. I think it's a real injustice to think of. If we're going to get the caliber of people to go work for nonprofit who have that entrepreneurial orientation and desire. But nobody goes to work for nonprofit for the money. But nobody should really have to sacrifice their personal lives because the levels of compensation are so low. And the stress in a nonprofit organization is extraordinarily high. I traveled between 16 to 70 percent of my time when I was president in each conservancy. And two little daughters growing up. But you know, you're not going to come out and say that in the light of a Senate investigation. You kind of hit a sensitive spot there. And what would you do if you were to go to the Senate and work with? Yes. I'm building off of that. Talk about how we need to get more people to the socialization and foundation. But there's a longest financial incentive against deviating from the Wall Street from the consulting path. Your foundation for the willingness to invest in a program that works again for the House to introduce the top universities into the social sector? Yeah, it's really good. Did you all hear that? Yeah. With our foundation. With our foundation or other foundations, we'd be willing to invest in ways of bringing people to the community and to have the kind of skills and talents I was describing that I think are necessary. But you know, frankly, understandably are attracted to working for McKinsey or in a corporation or a startup. Short answer is not, we haven't yet. But I was at dinner last night with some other foundation presidents. And we talked about this. We actually had our foundation. We have six people who came from consulting backgrounds. Four of whom were at McKinsey. And these are not people who were rejected by them. But you know, who felt that this was a different path they wanted to pursue. So I'm not sure that the, that we have to actually invest in it. I just, I think there are other ways to attract people with those backgrounds into the not for profit sector. We are, as a foundation, working with some of our major grantees in helping them build leadership. And in those cases, we're actually providing support for them to go hire people who, you know, frankly, wouldn't take the job, but for a little higher level of compensation. So we are, we are doing that. I think we are out of time. You have been listening to the Draper Fisher-Jurvis and entrepreneurial thought leader series.
