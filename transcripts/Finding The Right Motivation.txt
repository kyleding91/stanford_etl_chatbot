 Who you are defines how you build. This is the entrepreneur thought leader series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. I hope you guys are all ready for a master class on master class because we are incredibly excited today to welcome the CEO of master class David Rojier. I'm sure you guys all know of master class but master class is the live streaming platform that lets anybody learn from the world's best. David was born and raised in LA. He started the entrepreneurial bug bit him early. He started his first search company. I believe when he was a teenager which got acquired. He then went on to study political science at Wash U. And after Wash U, he worked for Tesco, the British retailer helping them come to the United States. He then came to the farm to Stanford to get his MBA. And after his MBA, he was hired by and invested in the much beloved Michael Deering. And he started then master class in 2015. Master class has made a mark in lifelong learning, really becoming one of the breakout companies in lifelong learning where anybody can get access to luminaries such as Martin Scorsese on filmmaking or Serena Williams for tennis or Stephane Curry for basketball or Margaret Atwood for writing. The list goes on and on. And so we are incredibly honored but don't leave Stanford everybody even though there are icons out there. We're incredibly honored to have David join us at ETL. So welcome David. Thank you. It is an honor to be here. I grew up on these podcasts. So I am grateful to be invited to speak. Then you know the power of these podcasts because it really is a full circle moment. I think when we have somebody who grew up on the podcast, come back to be on the podcasts. And what I'd love to do is start from the beginning because you've raised a staggering amount of capital. You've raised $240 million. And I think oftentimes it's so easy in our culture to laud the breakout companies like Masterclass which almost seem like inevitabilities when you look at it in retrospect but I feel like that does a disservice to the journey that you have actually gone through. And so I would love it if you could to take us back not when you raised $240 but just when you were before that $2 million check or during that $2 million check when you're in the stages of starting the company out. Can you shed some light into what it felt like at the very beginning? What was that process like when you were starting Masterclass and how did you come up with the idea? Yeah. Okay. So after school I went and worked for Michael Deering and I was working for him. I was investing in startups. And after a while I miss building things and I miss creating things. And I talked to Michael about it and Michael said, well why don't you propose something to him? And I was like, okay what if I go work on a bunch of things I have in my mind ideas and I could use some funding. Michael funded me which was amazing because I didn't have like a locked in idea or locked in team or anything. And so I was thrilled. I mean this is a chance of a lifetime. So once in a lifetime opportunity that's also terrifying because it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. And I knew this was going to be a chance I wasn't going to get again. And so I felt my own pressure without any structure to think of a great idea. And there are lots of books on it. There's lots of podcasts on it. But there's not one way that for sure works. And so I started I started thinking of my own needs in my life. I started thinking of trends happening in the world. I started talking to other folks to hear needs of their own. And I was trying to understand is somebody gave me a great piece of advice. She said choose something that even if it fails you are going to be proud of it. That was an amazing constraint. And I think sometimes having those constraints can make you more creative. So then for me it was like the optimization of a set of sales flow and funnel wasn't going to be the thing. I had to think what are the things that actually drive me in life. And you know I thought a lot about my grandmother. So I was in part raised by her. And I remember in second grade I would always stay I would always go on the way back from school to always stay with I would stay with her after school. I remember in second grade I go to her house and I would complain to her about all the math on my head. Which obviously I didn't have a lot because I'm like nine years old. And my grandma I'm complaining to her and I'm more I'm whining about it. And my grandma tells me I want to tell you a story. Which is like the last thing you want to hear when you're like nine years old. And my grandma that starts she was 16 years old living at the time in crack out in Poland. Her and her mom go on a family vacation. Dad's going to join but stays home a couple extra days to finish them work. While they're on vacation the not season faded. They killed her father took everything. She flees to New York City. The only job her and her mom can get is on the factory floor. They're working side by side and my grandmother's size she wants to become a doctor. She finds every medical school in the state of New York and applies them. She gets a note from every single one. She applies to every school she can. She gets no from every single one. Keep working factory applies again. She starts calling the Dean's admissions and asking why am I not getting in. And they all hang up on her except for this one guy who says I'll be honest with you. You have three strikes against you. You're a woman, a foreigner in your Jewish hangs up the phone. She keeps working the factory. Girls again the next year and gets into one school and becomes a pediatrician. I'm eight or nine years old. I'm staring at her because this is intense stuff to be hearing from just having complained about math homework. And she goes David the point I'm trying to make to you is education is the only thing someone can't take away from you. And that lesson stuck with me hard. And I realize if I have this one chance I want to try to build something that other people can't take away from others. If that is a constraint like all of a sudden the world of what I was going to work on got much got much smaller and I knew some being education and then it was about evolving and iterating and figuring out what was that going to be inside education. I love this idea that the constraint created focus because it sounded like it sounds like it might have been sort of this existential crisis without the constraint where you were funded and you could do anything and that was a bit unwieldy. Is that true? Yeah. I do. I think having constraints can breed can breed creativity. Yeah. And do you suppose some people say when you're starting out with the idea to try three or four different ideas in parallel and see which one works others say just focus on one idea and run it until you know it's going to succeed or fail and then shift to another. Do you have a philosophy on that? I was trying a few different ideas at the same time. I think in the beginning stages that's totally okay to do because there's sometimes you're working on one idea and there's like a delay from when you're in get a outcome back result actually trying to test something or run a poll. So having a few ideas it keeps you busy and there might be things you figure out in one that you like oh I can bring to the other. There also can be ones where you're working on it you're like I'm just not that into this like I'm getting bored already and if you're already bored at the beginning stages you're not down the idea. So that's a good heuristic. When you're bored that's the time to put the idea down and keep for saying that one. Because this is going to be an idea that you're going to work on for if this is successful for potentially the rest of your life. And you know I think most ideas though when you're starting out are good ideas but very few actually succeed because you hit sort of this end of the runway and either you get bored or you run out of time or you run out of cash and so so much of it is just deciding what you choose to focus on when you're starting out. So it's once you had this idea this enduring sense of purpose against this idea how did you decide what to focus on in order to take off what was did you have a minimally viable product or a minimally viable goal or some minimal criticality that you were shooting for and how did you choose which metric did you choose and how did you choose that metric versus others. I mean it took some time from knowing the space and what was trying to do to coming up with the master class idea right the idea of master class and that was you know user interviews mock mock mock to mock stuff up to do some test shoots and things like this right so that all that took some time to kind of hone in on that right but and then what what I'm doing was the advice of Roy Bajot who's an early investor of ours who said you need to create think of this as a science experiment come up with the five things that have to be true for this to work. Okay I have to get these types of people at the top level to be able to agree to do a class. I have to then prove I can make a good class with these types of people. I have to then show the people want to buy this class right I then show that I can do it at scale right and that you can then like build an organization that will last forever on right so you start to know okay how can I prove each point and you don't necessarily have to work them in in one two three in order so for example as I'm working to sign you know one idea really honed in working to sign folks like Martin Scorsese in a Christina Aguilera and Steph Curry okay I'm going to hustle I'm going to cold call but the same time I can run tests on and polls and you know polls and surveys would you be interested more in a doctor Dre class or in a Barack Obama class how much would you pay for it so you can start working like on the whole science experiment and you don't have to work at it just once at that time and you would not recommend working on one time by the time it sounds like you you wreck it there's there's virtue in making it iterative and constantly in adjusting each of the levers. Yes I think that's right I think you can be very select though about what stuff you do spend time on there's a whole lot of things when you create the idea that say it can be a can take your time and suck up that time which doesn't help the core idea or help test the core idea. And how do you know when something is a time suck versus an investment or something that you should kill versus something that you should feed. Are you thinking of like which idea to stop working no I'm thinking about these five different levels. Yeah I think for that you have to like go back and think what are the things they're going to make this a success or not and really push yourself on it. So for example if I you can spend a year of your life optimizing the healthcare plan of your employees there are a thousand options to provide for it. In the beginning stages the success of your company isn't going to be you chose healthcare plan A or healthcare plan B. So you think okay one of the things are going to actually define your success it's going to you know and so and you really have to really strip that down one of the things I did was I actually discussed it with other friends and other investors my list of five things and had them push had them push me on it and I remember talking to a friend who's like the first thing you got to work on is getting these people to actually teach without that there is no idea right and you're like shoot that guy's right that guy's right and so you have to be very strict with yourself and really push yourself on. And you know I think everybody who's interacted David with masterclass loves it but it's not the first life long learning platform this this space has been around for a long time in various incarnations if you had to attribute it to one or two things why do you think masterclass broke out or as other students. I think it's misunderstanding of of it's a misunderstanding or a bullet that a misunderstanding that education and learning are the same thing they're very different ask everybody who's watching this if you love to learn almost all of you will say yes. If I ask if you loved school most of you will probably say no but then you'll each say that there's three professors or school teachers that changed your life and I think in that you know contradiction or human contradiction is part of the idea that we as a society think education first of all stops after school stops and we think that education is only if you're in a classroom basically when I think the rate of change has increased so much in the world the education like what you learned in school it used to last you for your entire life that's no that isn't that's in the case anymore now we have to learn every day and we have to take charge our own learning and to do that you want to learn the way that you're going to enjoy you want to learn in a way that doesn't feel all the pressure of a bad class you want it's the best parts of it right and an in there is the intersection of entertainment and learning and I think that's our secret our secret is we were able to figure out that kind of space that kind of that that's such a beautiful and such an unintuitive in truth I think that I never really um realized until now is is is is that unintuitive truth something that you always knew or was it something that came out of this discovery work in iterating with you know with users and customers I think I didn't deep down I knew it but I couldn't articulate it I um I love to learn and school was rough for me and you know and so I couldn't rectify those things I love to learn I didn't like taking classes on MOOCs why right um and so it took the user interviews the tests to be like uh light like that you know to understand why if that makes sense or the how it for it and after you had that discovery of the how did you know that masterclass was going to be a success at that moment and if not when was the moment that you knew that masterclass was going to succeed and how long did it take to get there yeah so you know um skipping a bunch of steps and we brought we brought we brought on a team um co-founder joined and we launched in May of 2015 with uh about with about five classes and this has like been my work now for probably two or three years and so I am I mean so excited to get it on the world of course I'm nervous right but I think everybody in the world is going to want to know about this right because it's a bit all I've known for the past two two or three years right and um and we get ready to launch and I remember one of the guys on our team got me an extra phone charger because he's like your phone's gonna ring off the hook because you you have been in stealth here in no about your ring up we we launch the first day and I expect sales to be very high because the press is going to know about everything to know about it right so the first day will be really high first day is not high there's not high at all and I'm like we are screwed I went home and I don't often do this but like I cried because I'm like I got all these people on board a sir Reno Williams James James James Patterson any Leibwitz usher Dustin Hoffman and I'm going to have to go to them now and tell them thanks for belief thanks for your faith in us but this this isn't going to work and I called my parents and they're like you got to fake it until you up until you make it like you can't you know you you want up until you find a solution for this you got to act up next day I go to the office and I run into some of our marketing team and he's a big smile on his face I'm like why are you smiling he's like this is going to be a big business and I'm like wait what and he and the guy was looking at advertising response rates and our conversion rates he's like week this is going to scale and our second day was above our first day and I was like oh wait hold on if if the curve is going to keep going like this my trick and then our third day and our fourth day and all of a sudden you're like oh this like sales are increasing the company I'm like and and so probably the first day I thought first day we launched I thought this wasn't going to work on the second day I knew it was going to be a big business and it was two years before that first day launch two years post when you had that conversation with Michael Daring that oh oh oh from from the point of talk to Michael Daring that was probably roughly three years that's three years okay wow that is terrific and and then and that metric that you knew was it sales so oftentimes people I think wrestle with do they focus on monetization do they focus on growth do they focus on engagement are any one of those fine or was there one that stood out for you I think you have to figure out what what is trying to achieve we we needed to know that we could reach people at scale and so for us it was about like our LTV to CAC like can I profitably reach folks and then how much room do I have on that and so we saw that we had lots of room do you have a vision of what masterclass will become in ten years or do you operate where you don't think that far out and you're just trying to respond to what you need to do in the next six months we talk about internally as a hundred year plan and I like talking about as a hundred year plan because I like to get us out of the weeds out of the optimization for a month or quarter and really think long term and it's about making it possible for anybody to learn from the best imagine if you can go back in time and take a class from the right brothers even if eighty percent of what they figured out was wrong it be fascinating and so part of our mission is to be able to create that so in the future that actually exists so to me when I think about a hundred years out right it's less about what does the site look like or what you know what is the tech in the apps we're using but it's how do we become a staple in every home on the planet and my dream would be hopefully it's not a hundred years less somebody who has never had exposure to these people takes one of our classes becomes inspired and comes back to actually teach and do you how what do you think I do well I don't know if the right term is education or learning and maybe there's a distinction then in that vision but do you view yourself as disrupting fundamentally how education is going to operate in let's say 30 years and if so is there a desire to disrupt traditional education as it exists today I think the space market behind is the is the learning space so I think wanting to own that and owning the intersection of entertainment and and learning to me is is that's the space we own I think less about other people in the space or in the market there is always going to be a role for intensive education there's always going to be a role for that so it's less that it's just I think we don't we don't have a school for the rest of our lives we don't have a school for life after college and what that school looks like isn't going to be like the school that we attended it's going to have a different form it's not good there's not going to be tests or quizzes it's going to be something to help you learn for the rest of life which means you have it has a ring joy back to you well you know David I know I think that's great and I know that you have all these iconic masters on masterclass but I understand that you're also a master yourself of really great advice having gone through this experience too and so I want to ask you to I wanted to have a little David masterclass for our students and kick that off first by asking you know what advice do you most of our students are now or 20 or like in their late teens early 20s what advice would you have when you're at that stage in terms of career advice in terms of deciding what you should do I think the first five or 10 years your life in your career your job is to figure out what is greatness and what and what I mean by that is working with a bunch of different types of people in a bunch of different fields and in areas and figuring out this is what a great CFO looks like this is what a great CMO looks like this this is great unit economics and the reason is is in the beginning at least for me I didn't I didn't know what that looked like so in your first jobs right what I did was like if somebody fought the same way I did I assume that was right which is very egotistical as like months progress you realize hey there's somebody who's doing something that I wouldn't have done but it logically makes sense oh that's kind of impressive right and you learn oh maybe that's what great looks like the third step is you meet somebody who does something that you don't understand or you don't agree with and it works really well and you're like wait a second maybe that's greatness and it takes that evolution and why that's so helpful is it helps you figure out who are the people that you want to work with because you now know what greatness you know feels like it helps you when you want to work with other people when you hire other people but also gives you a sense when you're in a business that's doing very well there's a lot of things that are intangibles that you want to understand because you're going to see that in your own life so that's I think like my first piece advice so much so that I would prioritize that over almost any other thing in your jobs I'd prioritize that over over how much money they're going to pay you I don't I'd prioritize that over your job title in your first years your life it's about learning I mean as much as you can your jobs that's like my first piece of advice for that I think an entrepreneurship it's a little different I think an entrepreneurship before jumping in it's the hardest thing you're ever going to do at least professionally I think I have lost friends I've put on weight I've been stressed at a level I didn't know existed you can't get it out of your head it's it is and they're really dark days and it's really brutal and hard and you have to be okay with that and accept that now on the other side it's also the best thing I've ever done you realize a self-confidence in yourself that you gain from it the feeling of having impact with people on a scale is a dicting and fulfilling working with people that are the best in the world at what they do it it's just a high in life and so it is single-handedly the like this is the best job I've ever had it's also the most difficult job I've ever had and you have to be okay with that yeah well I think it's very hard to leave I mean it's certainly the most engaging and intriguing experience it sounds like you could have and you know in those dark times I think that's is when you also are it forces you to open up to have to get help and to get advice when you normally wouldn't and I think advisors can play key roles in especially if you're navigating into areas that you don't you don't know how to navigate into before I understand you have some good advice on that okay okay can you share your advice on advisors how do you my advice onizers yeah I did it wrong at first what I did in advisor was like I know lots of smart piece lots of smart people I'm gonna ask them advice on every decision I have to make if you ask three smart people or five smart people who are vice you'll get like a hundred different thoughts and opinions and it is paralyzing because these are thought it's smart people right and so what I realize is you need to in the entrepreneurship journey your whole path in journey you want like two advisors that you kind of tell everything to and you want advisors that are a couple stages ahead of you and then what you want are people that have strong points of view because what you're actually I think asking them for is not advice in the situation there's no way they're gonna have all the context like no exactly what you're asking them for is a what you want is a strong point of you that you haven't thought of and you want two people that do not think the same so you get more diverse more expansion of ideas and diversity of money because what you're actually asking them to do is show you the rest of the chess board it's almost like when you're not a friend or you can only see a couple squares around you and what you're asking is not where to move your piece but is for them to like unhide the rest of the board or imagine that in a computer game you're paying the the rest of the world or whatever it is that's what you're asking for because then you're gonna be like oh I didn't know that was an option oh I could do that I'm just gonna I'm gonna go to that's where it said I love that that you know the biggest blind spot is the things that you don't even know that you don't even know and just getting that visibility is really where the inside is that's so thank you David yeah David I know you've been pretty open about talking about having a stutter and and and your experience with that and I find that far too few leaders do talk about that and so if you can I would love to ask about what is your what can you talk about the experience of having a stutter can you talk about what your relationship is like with your stutter and what's the best advice that you've received or that you would want to give to others either with a stutter or with some involuntary situation that they have to navigate with so I stutter you guys probably heard it anyway I've said it ever since I was a kid it was much worse when I was a kid which is common it was especially early on in life it was very difficult I was teased a lot for in school and it's really frustrating to not only not be able to express yourself but it's really frustrating to have an idea you want to express and people when you when you stutter they don't focus on your idea they focus on the stutter so to realize even if I can get the idea out they're not going to hear it because they're just going to focus on how the words came out I really think a lot my my parents and my brother my parents basically had a rule for us that they weren't going to let stuttering it wasn't going to be allowed as an excuse for not doing anything so for example when my parents had friends over for dinner the expectation was my brother and I joined them and engaged in adult conversation even have like age 8 and the idea was is like you're not blaming not participating on your stutter and I think that had a big impact on my brother and because it made it seem like it will that's not an excuse at home then like you know when cannot use as an excuse and I remember I told my grandparents that I stutter and I was being teased in school and they gave me a hug and said so because to them who at you know the other side had been in concentration camps and you know I mentioned my grant I talked about the other side that escaped to them you're you think a stutter is bad I mean you want to talk about bad things in life and so you know it was always with a hug but it was like that's not going to stop you so there are times are really hard but and I kind of speech I don't a bunch of work on it and therapy but I don't know it's like I have to rest my life. Thank you thank you for sharing I'm going to turn it over to the student questions in a bit but I'm going to ask one more question before I do which is one of the focuses for the ETL for for this year is around principle driven entrepreneurship and I would want I want to invite you to speak to if that honestly if you guys do use principles in driving entrepreneurship I also understand that there was a situation in your one of your fund raises where where principles came to play with a perspective investor I don't know to what extent you can share but if you whatever extent you can I want to welcome it on or any real life situation that caused where you had to invoke your principles and making decisions and what you did yeah um I one of the things I encourage all you do is to really think about zoom forward ahead in your life and say hey if I'm on my deathbed what do I have to do in my life to not regret anything and for me that is and that then that can change over your life but for me right now that's I don't want to be on my deathbed and think I didn't try to make the world a bit better and their times I I think I'm living that life and there's times I'm not right and so then for me from there I could stem some principles I I believe in and so one of the things we tried to have the company is anytime we have to make a big decision or something hard we list out first our principles and that can change so when the pen when the pandemic struck we came up with our list of prints of our print our principles when there's a hard decision we're going to make on funding or expanding this area we also do that and there is one case where um we were doing a fundraising round and we got approached for you know um a raise and we got a you know um a bunch of turn a bunch of uh of the best of one of the best and one of the investors who we saw the we and you know we thought it wasn't really a really a really great fit we we found out and back channeling them that they did not match and live our our our principles and even though the terms are great they really didn't and I went to the board and I said hey look I know these are offering really fantastic terms but I don't this isn't who we are and it's not who I want to work with and I was so nervous about that because you know you can imagine a board being like tough luck David you just choose the people that are going to give you the best terms and the board was my board was amazing about it and supportive about it and said we have your back and I called up that investor and I fund and I told them I'm not taking the money and I thought if I'm really going to live our principles and I was pushed on this you know by you know um a close friend and you know our COO who was like you know if you're going to live your principles you got to have the conversation with them and we had the I had a conversation about why I'm passing um because I was the only way I thought that actually might have some change in the world and was this a situation where that it was just a disagreement on principles where they understood that they stood on the other side of a principle or was this something where the investor didn't even know that they were doing something that you that that was aware that you were aware I don't think they agreed with my interpretation with how I think they live and but that but that's fine but like I'm not working and is there any level of specificity just to make this more real for the founders on you know what those principles might have been or and you don't have to if that's the level of of share that you feel comfortable with yeah I mean the yeah I mean everybody's principles are going to be different right and so but for mine you know I picture you know who are people I want to be in the fox hole with who are people I want to work with how do they treat other other people um and you know how do they treat other people to have less power than them then um so yeah yeah okay and so it came out for you that they violated those principles by talking to others so so I think I think the takeaway that I want to get to the founders is that the real way to know what an investor is like is is I think ultimately their principles which is I think exhibited by their actions and and and the only and the way to know that is to talk to other founders that they've typically backed or other people that is that is that you have to book or taking any money from an investor when you get an investor on your board they are with you potentially for life it is easier to get the to end a relationship to divorce somebody then it is to get rid of a board member so you got to choose this is somebody I'm okay to work with for the rest of my life potentially so the I think besides having a whole bunch of time with them the best way to do that is talk to other entrepreneurs that have worked with them and you want to talk to other entrepreneurs who companies did not do well if the company did did the companies performed well usually everybody's everybody's happy every's good it's like you want to talk to an entrepreneur where this board member this potential investor you think of it was on their board and stuff went really bad and how did they act and I think I think what's amazing also about the story is not just that you found out that through the back channel that there was a violation of principles but then you also said it's not enough just for me to politely pass but I have to actually tell the investor that there otherwise I'm living my principles and I think the the that if you it might hurt hurt you in the short term but I don't want to live life breaking my my core values and I figure in the long run it will it's going to be worth it and how soon would you recommend you articulate your principles as a company I think it takes a little bit of time for them to actually occur and happen you have to go through a few things do it if you can do it before before you start it's amazing great I think for us it probably took a couple you know I don't know if it was a year or so I'm trying to think the first time we use principles I mean but it took us a little time to like figure out what are things we actually care about and then you start putting it all over the all all over the place so everybody knows it okay terrific I'm gonna open it up for questions now with the the the the students we've got a bunch of questions and they've been uploaded so I'm gonna go from the most popular ones down the first question is how did you successfully recruit those first few famous and busy people to teach classes when you did not already have the reputation for them to trust you and it was just the very beginning I mean cold calls and cold cold emails one of the first was James Pat James James Pat James Patterson who's like the best length author in the country I sent lots of cold emails and notes I mean lots and lots of them and and then one one day I'm walking in Santa Monica Santa Monica and I get a call myself on his phone his phone number I don't record I don't write I don't write I don't recognize which is like but I answered it I don't know why answer it now I wouldn't probably right and he's like hi this is James Patterson and I was so unsmoo I was like the author he's like yeah I'm like I'm really surprised to hear from you and James like well I'm a surprising guy and I was like okay well now he's funny right and he's like I saw your I saw your proposal the timing works I would love to I would love to teach and you're like and in my head I'm like wait how do I know if this is really James Patterson like it's a friend playing a prank what is it and then you know we met we met him we sent him with him and but if it was cool it was cold calls and cold emails with the most part I think one of the things that we try to do was think okay what is it that these folks care a lot about well these folks you know it's not it's not it's not about it's not about money they can do it in American Express commercial earn much more money it's like they there's somebody in their life the top them that had to begin having that they want to give back okay well that's one thing two is they're gonna care a lot that it's good I mean they're putting their names on it to be out on the world they want to make sure okay how can I show that I don't come from film background but other other folks I can work with so for example build Guten Tag who's a professor at Stanford who does some film classes I talked to him and we went to him ask him for advice and he's like I'm willing to shoot a few and you're like wait really because if you're willing to do that this can be a much easier to your process J Roach is a director who did the same thing and so by attaching these some of these folks it was a sign that they could trust it was gonna it was gonna be something though it was good they they could they were will be proud of it that's terrific how many called emails just out of curiosity did you have to send do you think before you got your first bite oh I mean probably in the in the in the hundreds and I think one thing I learned was lots of people are gonna tell you your idea is impossible those same people after the idea works are gonna tell you I always told you it was a great idea but the important part is when somebody says impossible I used to get discouraged about it to be honest and like sad about it a little bit because like you're trying any signal or sign that your idea is going to work and so anybody who says like bad about it it like it hurts I was looking at that completely wrong when somebody says an idea is impossible chase that idea because what any start any startup if you're if your idea or you're gonna join somebody else's you have you have to believe in the impossible you have to believe in something that the rest of the world things cannot be done otherwise they would do it or they think it's just a bad idea so you're by you have you have to get okay with that and now you can look at that one's way so impossible like if they think it's impossible that might mean the opportunity there actually that's right that's right the next question is would you say that COVID-19 boosted the popularity of masterclass because everyone had more time at home and is now more used to the online learning format and I know you were referencing this before about how you were reacting with COVID-19 with your principles would love to hear you talk more about COVID-19 how that's affected you and how you approached the change yeah I mean first thing we did was we reached out to folks you know in five advisors that had been there before what a strong point of view and one of them was Jeff Imel the former CEO of GE he gave great advice he has been through three mapper shocks and he said hey one of the pieces of advice is you have to hold two different truths in your head at the same time this is like unlocking the like board for me right because like what I don't even I don't even know what that means and he's like you have to figure out two different truths on different extremes that you have to hold in your head at the same time and as a species we are very bad at that we do not like ambiguity or uncertainty and so I realized a two different truth is I needed a hold was one this is going to screw our business people aren't going to want to buy class anymore so we can possible to shoot anything and we're going to be in really bad spot the other truth is say hey this is an opportunity for us to really live our mission and people are going to be at home they're going to want to be educated they're not going to be able to go go to school and this is an opportunity for us to fill out and so we had a hold in plan for both for both of those truths at the same time and what ended up happening was you know we first we then decided to write down our prints all our principles number one was what we care most about is safety the safety of our team instructors everything else comes after that number two was we have to hold two different truths in our head right into it and so we came up with the whole as principles and so you know we got already out of the out we made sure of no people didn't have to be at the office you know tried to be a safe spot wherever we can we did see a surge in the in people want want in our classes so it depends on the week but there are some days and weeks where we were up a thousand percent year over year but what it really did in the long run is just accelerate current trends I think trends we always believe we're going to happen people love to learn people want to learn they actually want to be in charge of how they learn on their own they want they want to have joy from it they want to have impact on their life they want to do it at home things that we had believed for years it's great there's a there's a class a question I don't know if you can answer this or pick your favorite child so it's your your your prerogative but the question is what is your favorite course on master class yeah it's like a favorite child I'll tell you something I was surprised how much I loved Hans Zimmer class I have like a whore I like I can't keep it like the beat I don't have a good sense of of of of rhythm and so you know any choir class I had to get school I was always put in the back row and you know just like you don't really need to sing that loud with David and so taking Hans Zimmer class or you know we you know working on Zimmer and taking on his class and he begins a class basically by saying every note either asks or answers a question I'm like what kind I mean I'm like I'll believe this this is everybody's in his I don't know what he's talking about and then he's like let me show you an example and he plays like here is a nice question and he plays a note on the piano here is a nice answer here is a sketchy answer I'm like wait what I could hear that and you're like whoa and you realize like for him every note is about telling a story and that class has completely changed how I hear music well thank you I'm gonna that's I'm gonna watch that tomorrow um next question what do you consider to be master classes strongest and most direct competition independent content creators on YouTube university sponsored edx courses selected professors from the great courses netflix amazon apple original content so question um how really think of any of those competitors I think in our consumer insights work what we learned is when people are deciding between us and spending their money on something else it's about other things that can improve their own life so it's other classes workshops other self-improvement self-development you know on certain things like on meditation or you know things to improve your life and develop your life what we compete against the traditional OTT players is actually on time spent so the time that we steal away are from entertainment platforms um I don't uh to be honest we we're in a space where there's not direct compared there's not direct folks are competing against us yet um because it's really about this intersection of education entertainment um I think those other things are compliments more so there's a related question here on ted do you think about ted as a competitor no no okay okay um the next question is what's your assessment on the interplay between certification education and qualification how do you recommend people highlight their self-directed education that doesn't yield a diploma degree or a certificate real real really really great question I think and we've seen this happen more and more importance and weight will be put to your skills and what you've created and so I think they're as your own career grows what school you went to has less weight because it was and so I think as much as you can to show people either in the application process interview process you're looking looking for jobs even when you're on the job the job interviews is to show your work so something like I really believe is true if you want a job the best way I think to get it is to do a piece of work for the company and show it to them so um you know I'll give you an example uh dirt dirt in school I really wanted to intern at ideal so I wanted to intern and so I do have application process and I was like look I got a convince them like I can enter there because I was a supply chain guy there's no way idea was going to even look at me so I decided to spend days and days and days of my time in baggage claims at airports and I put together a book that was here's how I would improve baggage claims at airports and my application I sent them that book I got a printed on like one of the printing web websites on this to print or something like that um and I got an interview because that in the first interview they're like so what's this book about right do it but like it was all like here's all the observations I had of the baggage claim here's why I think they aren't why everybody hates them here's the steps I would do to improve them and in that process A it shows I really care about the job two is they're starting to see even though I never like work in design right or innovation they're gonna tell just by the book was it well-designed book like how does this meet our standards not they're gonna see my thought my thought process that was a ton of work but I ended up getting an interview hey there you go there you go well I don't this question is going to sort of be dovetailing that in a in a in a countervailing way but this question is how is business school how has Stanford Business School helped you in your career up to and during your entrepreneurial journey would you recommend business school I think there's this myth that I've business schools like entrepreneurs do not get MBAs I get offended by that um I think you can learn a tremendous amount an MBA program that's gonna help gonna going to going to help you in your entrepreneur and you be on the printer I think here are the big things I took I took I took away from it one was I figured out what my compare what I was good at and what I wasn't good at I thought I was really quantitative and my previous jobs I was one of the most quant quantitative people there and I get to Stanford and I am not one of the most quantitative people folks there I'm taking a compute a a a a a a a a a a a C S class and it's taking me like eight out eight hours to do the homework problems and my friend is getting them done in an hour and like I'm like what is going on right and you just like I realized that wasn't my comparative advantage and like if I wanted to be very quantitative and like that's what I want to micro to be I have I was gonna have a lot of work to do to actually do it and I realized okay what are the things that I actually am good at compared other people that was immensely helpful I think the other part of the most helpful is you learn about people and professions that like I just didn't know existed I didn't have friends that worked in PE before or in product and like that was new for me to understand and the third there are professors and classes that ways of thinking that just expanded my mind a little bit that you know it goes back to like our unknown unknowns like it helps you figure out turn unknown unknown into into hopefully their known unknowns or to no knowns yep that's good PE guy by the way is private equity for all you non-beats sorry sorry I just but I can't I didn't know what that was until like I yeah yeah one final question we're almost out of time and I'm gonna ask just exercising my prerogative to ask a final question when has it been the most fun to be the CEO of masterclass at what stage oh every every stage is out what's the most fun what's the most fun um there are just days you'll never forget um there's days and that can be um you know we were on set with Christina Aguilara shoot and you know she just starts singing like acapella without doing this like this is the practice for her class to do it and it just like blows you and you're like you're like if we can figure out this magic to put into the class like that it like this is going to work right and then people put it up in the way and you'll see it's like amazing um and so there's parts like that there's a part um I love Chipotle and I eat Chipotle a lot and and we do a thing every year where it's uh I we do a costume costume costume contest for Halloween and one day in one for one year there was a group on a team that dressed up not only as Chipotle but as the food order that I eat all the time and you're like it was so funny and it's being teased in a way with love and you know you're like that's just amazing that's just amazing the entrepreneurial
