 Who you are defines how you built. This is Thought Leaders Revisited, a special summer 2020 edition of our OddPrioral Thought Leaders series. During this summer of uncertainty, we're inviting some of the most influential past ETL speakers to join us for a series of new conversations about innovation, leadership, and especially finding opportunities in the midst of a crisis. Today I'm really excited to welcome Chris Redleance, Beverly Parenty, and Ray Hartz back to ETL. Beverly and Chris are the co-founders of the last mile, an organization that aims to break the cycle of incarceration by providing education and career training opportunities in prisons. Founded 10 years ago, 2010 at San Quentin State Prison, the last mile has become one of the most requested prison education programs in the United States. And Ray Hartz was a participant in the last mile program at San Quentin, where he crafted a plan for Healthy Hartz Institute and he launched and leads this venture. Chris, Beverly Ray, welcome to ETL, really delighted to talk to you since your last visit, seven years ago and 2013. Thanks for having us. Yeah, great to be with you. We're going to talk about what's going on now, but we're going to also play some short clips from your last visit to help tee up the conversation. Now I have to tell you I am a huge fan of the last mile. In fact, I've got my last mile sweatshirt on right now. The talk you gave seven years ago stimulated me to start volunteering in the program. And from my vantage point, it has been incredibly remarkable to see the program grow and expand. So I want to start with a short clip with Beverly talking about what motivated the launch of this program. So let's start with a clip about, you know, what inspired this at the very beginning? My first reaction was, why would I want to spend my free time? Because I have so little of it anyway, why would I want to spend my free time working with prisoners? But he had that passion and he actually asked me not to make any judgments about something I knew very little about. So reluctantly, I committed to do research about incarceration and also to go and visit the men to experience firsthand what he was so passionate about. So first was my research. Well, I wanted to find out more about the issues facing the prison system in California today. And what I learned from my research made me realize that even a small scale effort could make a difference. So here's some of the learnings. In California, we spend more for prisons than higher education. The average cost per prisoner to taxpayers $45,000. The rate of recidivism exceeds 60%. So by the time many men are released from San Quentin, as taxpayers, we've already invested nearly $1 million for their incarceration. But without rehabilitation, many of them will return. That's a bad investment. If we could reduce recidivism by just 5%, billions of dollars could be saved in the next 10 years alone. Wow, really, really impressive. And I think that this was such an enormous opportunity to do something. So what have you learned in over the last 10 years of running this program? We've learned a lot. Certainly that was very early on the program. Ray was there and we're going to talk about that a little bit later. But I think a few things that we've learned about how to operate a program in prison because both Beverly and I have never had any experience in prison before just visiting prison, let alone running a program in prison. And what we learned is how to work with corrections. I come from the start of environment as a venture investor and everything is very, very zero to 60 very quickly. Corrections doesn't move that thing. So we realize that we had to do things very incrementally and build in relationships, talk down within corrections. And now we have where in six states today, we have great relationships with the department corrections and with the governors of each state. And then it's really important. The second thing we learned is how to deliver a program that can scale because San Quentin is very unusual because very close to San Francisco. And as you've done with your class growing your students up to mentor in San Quentin, which is phenomenal. But in most locations are remote. So today we basically run all of our programs remotely. We have a studio in San Francisco where we broadcast live into the classrooms and they have a learning management system there that they can log into. So utilizing technology has really allowed us to scale the program. So one of the things that I find very interesting is you started out teaching entrepreneurship, right? Of course, that's what you knew. You're, you know, in the world of venture capital. And then you ended up pivoting to decide to teach coding. What motivated that change? What really motivated the change was market demand. And at the time, remember this was, you know, almost a decade ago, we realized that there would be a shortage of 1 million software engineers by 2020. That's what was predicted by 2020, which is where we are today. So we decided to teach skills, marketable skills, because our mission is to provide marketable skills that result in gain to employment. And it was all a test. It was just could we possibly teach software engineering without the internet? I mean, we created all these challenges. So software engineering, great jobs, high market demands, and great pay. And those were the things that really drove us to start a coding program as a test. Very, very interesting. Well, I want to bring Ray into the conversation. And I know that, you know, one of the most important things you did was to give paint, help people paint a picture of a future that was different than their past. And I'd like to turn to Ray, who was a student in the program. You did a magnificent job during the last ETL session, sharing with us your one minute pitch. Now, this was something that I know was a very important part of the entrepreneurship training is not just coming up with the idea, but figure out how do you pitch it to people to get them really excited about what you're doing. So I want to play the pitch that you gave seven years ago and talk to you about how this venture has essentially evolved since then. So let's play, let's play your one minute pitch. By so-of-hands, how many of you have witnessed either a parent, a child, a friend, or maybe your spouse struggle with obesity? You don't have to raise your hand for this one, but think about it. Did you ever feel helpless in their struggle? If you have, they're not alone. Many people who have lived in a low income community, like I have, where the obesity rates above 50% have experienced the same feeling of helplessness. That's why today I'm doing something about it. Good evening, my name is Horatio Hartz, and I'm the founder of Healthy Hartz Institute, the co-op that we're bringing, health and fitness back into our neighborhoods. HHI will turn empty lives into gardens and transform neighborhood food deserts into green nutritional oasis. We will turn abandoned buildings into lead certified fitness centers and provide our members safe places to exercise. Our goal is to get us back to the good old days when the community was right with nutritional foods, kids were outside running and playing, and the obesity rate was below 17%. So join the Healthy Hartz Institute and let us empower the beat of your heart. Thank you. Yeah. That was super great pitch, and you had did it without any preparation. You just pulled it off. So how did can we start over just how did the program, the last mile program influence you, Ray? So first of all, thank you for having me back, man. It's crazy to look back seven years ago and see where I was at then, where I'm at now, how the program is evolved. So thank you for having me here. If I think back about how the last mile influenced me, I think about my mindset at the time where I first encountered T.O. Lym. And I was just a year to the house, maybe not only at a year left before I'd be released, and I had spent the last seven years really focusing on educating myself, preparing myself to start on a business. So when I met Chris and Beverly through the last mile, it was pretty exciting. Just thinking about how I can leverage what they're teaching into great mom business. So it's been hard. Yeah, it's amazing. So how is your venture doing because you got out and you actually started to pursue this idea. It wasn't just an academic exercise. You're now running healthy hearts. Yeah, it's doing well. You know, over the last few years, we've grown. It took me a little while to get it started, but in 2017, I got my first grant, and I turned that into an organization. So we launched a community garden, started with 10 beds. We got 20 garden beds, and about 22 hundred square foot of growing space. We're teaching mindfulness classes and nutrition classes and cooking classes, gardening classes. We're feeding about 170 families twice a month with the food we grow, and with our partnership with the Conflict of County Food Bank. Fabulous. I mean, really, really great. I couldn't be more delighted. It's interesting to think about, you know, teaching in prison has a lot of challenges. I know that I've done a lot of classes, a number of classes with the last mile where I brought up Stanford students. We did actually one course, which was taught jointly between Stanford and San Quentin. You know, no internet access. You know, the power goes out. There's lots and lots of challenges. In fact, right now, there's a much bigger challenge with the COVID crisis that's happening at San Quentin. It's interesting to start thinking about, given all the constraints, what is the metrics you use for success? And I want to go to a clip from Chris talking about the key performance indicators here. How are you going to measure whether this program is successful, given all the constraints? So let's play this clip and then talk about how that's evolved over time. So we started the program, but we have to have, as you you know, learn and talk about startups, what are our KPIs? How do we judge the success of this program? And first, the first thing that we had to understand and appreciate was, does it resonate with them and in prison? Is this something they want to learn? And can they really absorb the applications that we're presenting to them? Because they have no internet access. They have no access to technology. And with a correctional system, adopt what we're trying to do, and be open enough to understand what we're trying to accomplish. So really good question. And so I'm wondering how your KPIs have changed over the last 10 years. Chris? Yeah, they really haven't changed that much. I mean, the three that I mentioned then were, you know, is it going to resonate inside? And that was the time when we were launching the entrepreneurship program. So the bigger question that when we launched coding in 2014 was even a bigger question, is there going to be interest in that? And can we actually do it? That was a big question. So those KPIs certainly have remained the same. You know, as we expanded, you know, now we're in women's prisons and youth facilities. And we are constantly conscious about our curriculum resonating properly within the institution and making sure that what we're teaching is really employee, you know, remained be employee with skills. The second part was will the community participate? You know, will people come in and volunteer? Will they, you know, do things? Whether or not they financially donate and support it that way? And that, as you have said, because you have been a phenomenal volunteer, Stanford has been really engaged. So we've had really, I think that it's the numbers almost a thousand volunteers we've had over time. So we checked that box for sure. And then the third one was, you know, with companies higher. And, you know, early on, the question was, are they going to pursue the ideas that they did in the entrepreneurship program as Ray has done? Or as we expanded into coding, with tech companies higher? And that's absolutely the case today. So, you know, the KPIs ran being the same. The goals are a bit different, but our KPIs definitely are the same. Yeah, so Ray, did you, were you aware of what the KPIs or the metrics or goals were? And how did that resonate for you as someone who was in the program? Yeah, I was aware of. I think Chris, I mentioned them early on in the classes. And, you know, he mentioned his thoughts about what it resonated. You know, yeah, it definitely, I think that's the one that sticks with me the most. It definitely resonated to have someone like Chris come in and then some of the distinguished guests that he brought into the program was like super inspiring. It exposed me to a different world. Kind of like, I think I'm reading this book, Tonahashi Coast between the world and me. And it kind of creates that parallel, right? Where I come from and then where Chris comes from. So, this program kind of bridges that gap, right? So, I think that it definitely resonated with me off to the races later. Great. So, I want to encourage people who are watching the Stanford students as well as those people who are watching on YouTube to ask questions. The Q&A app is open and feel free to ask anything you'd like. We're really eager to respond to the things that are you're curious about. One of the things that you brought up is getting support for the program. And, you know, this is not inexpensive to run a program like this. I know you've had to get a lot of very extensive computer equipment and to build all sorts of internal tools and lots of other resources that need to be available. I want to play a clip about how you thought about building alliances to support this program. And then to talk about the other sources of support that you've been able to get over time. So, let's play our fourth clip looking at, you know, how you start bringing alliances in early on. So, all of our funds and support will become privately. You know, I think when we went to Sacramento the first time, we finished the meeting with Matt Cady who was a Secretary of Presence at the time. I think he was waiting for us to have our handout. And my hand was this instead of this. And it made a big difference, right? So, we can get a lot further by doing it outside of that. And we really want to show that you can marry private and public effectively without taking public funds. So, that's really been our strategy. So, I'm curious, Beverly Chris, what have been the most interesting or most successful sources of support over the last 10 years? Yeah, at the time when we did that event, it was all privately funded. There was a resistance early on from our perspective to engage public funding because we want to make sure that we established the program. We had success metrics that we could actually you know, present. Today we have support from both public and private. And as I mentioned in that comment, it's really important that we have this public private partnership in every state that we're in because it's not only it's great to get public funding, but it's even more powerful to bring in private companies because not only they bring their funding, but they also bring their employee base and they allow their employees to participate in this, which is really valuable today and today's market. I know you've had a lot of really interesting innovative companies get involved, you know, come to visit and hire folks. I mean, one of the things I'm most excited about is, you know, people could actually outsource their coding to the prison program to the last mile. So, the men who are there or the women in other prisons can actually be doing projects and have referenceable projects that they put on their resume when they get out. Can you talk a little bit about that? Sure, we can. And I just wanted to mention just some of the funding groups also. I think it's really important to mention that the, you know, Google.org is a big funder of ours, stand together as a big funder of ours, Chan Zuckerberg, Bank America, and it's really, as I said, important to engage the employee base as part of that proposition. So, I just wanted to call out those. I don't know if there's anybody else who wanted to mention. Obviously, California Department of Corrections and CalPA, which is printed industries, are a major partner of ours as well. Well, that's the, CalPA is part of the story of the development inside as well. But they are the ones that actually, it's prison industry authority. They helped fund the original coding program at San Quentin, which is a CTE or Career Technical Education. And not only do the students learn these amazing skills, but they also get milestone credits towards their sentence. So, for every six months, that a student inside San Quentin successfully completes a cohort of the last mile, they earned seven weeks off their sentence. Wow, that's amazing. It's unbelievable. Yeah, and I understand that in the, that, you know, a lot of the people work inside prison and they get paid a minimum amount, but the folks who are in the last mile actually get paid a significant wage for the work they're doing for companies. That's right. Yeah, that's true. You know, unfortunately, because of, you know, the pandemic, that is closed down today. So, TLM works is what it's called. And it's, it's on hiatus because of the pandemic, so we can't actually operate it. But, you know, the hourly wage inside for our program is a little over $20 an hour, which is one of the highest wages paid in prison in the US. So, it's something where the participants can save and have money when they get out, which is super important, because today, you know, Ray can certainly attest to this that when you get out of prison, the government gives you basically $200 and potentially a bus ticket, and that's it, where here, they actually have savings that will help them reestablish, get an apartment potentially, and get started. Just to put the $20 in perspective, the average prison wage is 32 to 95 cents and it's amazing, really remarkable. So, Ray, I'm curious, you know, when you were in this program, what did other people think about this program who were in it and those who were not in it? Was this looked at as, you know, very elite opportunity? How did you, how did other people view this in within the system? So, you know, I was a second cohort to go through there. And so, you know, they hadn't exploded yet. I think people were, you know, it was gaining traction at that time. People starting to become more aware of it, but I can't speak to the participants ourselves, like we're super excited, like the had this opportunity, and then, you know, I just had to progress, and we get our second demo day, I think people became more excited about participate. The demo days are incredible. I mean, you know, what an amazing amount of excitement to see these ideas come to life. There's a question from one of the students, Teray, and it says, you know, what were some of the barriers you faced when you started healthy hearts? I'm assuming outside of prison, and how did you overcome them? Oh, man. You know, some of the barriers, I think, was just getting myself out there, letting people know who I was and sharing my story and having access to capital, that's still a barrier, and able to hire talent. That's something that's super difficult, just because where I'm at. There are a number of things, but, you know, the main thing is to live with purpose. Like, I really feel like I live with purpose. And when times seem hard, you know, I lean on that, you know, when I see other organizations, you know, and I'll speak on this real briefly, just because of the times that we're in. When I see other organizations that are non-black, and they receive like four times amount of funding I receive and have the time, or they hire talent to build off the team. Like, highly skilled people come out and volunteer to build their team, or you see, when I get a newsletter, and this is well-written content, we have videos to boot. You know, I wonder why don't I have something like that? Where's the barriers for me, where I'm not able to create that type of support, so I can get this type of, so my community can get the support they need. So when I look at those type of barriers, especially, you know, the highlight right now is just talking about all the black lives matter, and you see all these big brands speaking about it. But when I think about what I've experienced personally, it makes me think about like, is this a part of structural racism, right? That I'm not receiving that. So those are some barriers, and I'm just going to speak my truth, right? I could see your code in and say like, right, you're not working hard enough. But then as entrepreneur, you have to figure it out. It doesn't matter if you're black or white or whatever color you are. If you're an entrepreneur, you have to figure it out. You have to overcome these names, right? And you got to state a course. And for me, I'll say to any entrepreneur, like if you're doing some purposeful, then lean on that. Like if you have purpose and you're living through purpose, lean on that and you'll be able to overcome whatever obstacle it is no matter what. So I'm curious. Have you been able to tap into the last mile network outside of prison? I know there have been a lot of people who have graduated from the program and are out out in the world. Has that been a valuable network? Yeah, definitely. There's folks that I reach out to all the time. A lot of, you know, to be completely honest, like a lot of people that I know that are outside of my community, some way we're tied through the last mile. It's not directly and directly, right? And so that's in that sense, definitely, then that work has definitely helped me. Even on a personal note, being able to go to one of the Chris's friends, Winery, Hourglass with Jeff Smith, just been able to go there for my 45th birthday and take my family to experience something that we never get access to. Like everybody in my family, this is a year and a half later, they still talk about this was a moment. So this type of place, this type of network, like it exposes us to different things. So yeah, I definitely lean on my TLM network. Wonderful. So we have another question from another student and I encourage others to chime in with other things you're curious about. Jessica asks, you know, she says, government can infamously be, be, be infamously challenging and slow to work with, but they're necessary to have a legitimate impact. Do you have any advice on working with bureaucracies to produce effective results? You know, what, what has been most effective and what kind of clues can you give others? Yeah, you know, I think really it's building an incremental relationship. What I mean by that is that you can't, if I went in to CDCR 10 years ago and said, I want to be able to technology center inside San Juan to teach coding, they would have said, there's the door, right? So you have to start very early and develop relationships. And also, this is not just government, but as anything when you're trying to develop a business is a fine champion that believed in your cause. So we had Matt Kate, who I mentioned in my talk 10 years ago, he was the secretary of prisons at the time, he and I connected and he understood the cause. Chuck Patillo, who was the GM of CalPIA, understood the cause. And so we really built those relationships. And now, you know, we do have a tech center in San Juan. As you've been in there, we have, we took the old print factory, gutted it, we have five classrooms soon to be eight classrooms. So it is really a flagship facility that many states now come and visit and see what they can do. But I think really is starting those incremental relationships are really important. One thing I would add to that is that there are all these processes and procedures that are in place today that have been in place for a long time. I would say doing your research and understanding what the proper protocols and procedures are within whatever the type of business or program you're trying to implement in that governmental agency and start working within the realm of what is available to you and then establish yourself. And then as you decide to change and add, you will have already situated yourself within the agency or with the relationship. And I think one of the things that they said about us early on is that we learned how to fit in and make incremental change. But we didn't come in and try to change everything. I think it's really interesting. You found some really strong advocates who were able to allow you to get in the door and then you demonstrated success. I mean, I think that's the other thing is it's not just getting other people to support you. You need to demonstrate some early success that then everyone wants to be associated like, oh, that worked. I'm going to support that. I mean, over the six years that I've been working with you, it's amazing the accretion of more resources and more people, the more you accomplish, the more the more people are willing to get on board. And they learned to trust you. And trust is so vitally important in this relationship. So one of the things that's super interesting to me is how you've expanded this program out across the state and the country. And I think it would be really powerful for people to understand this isn't just in San Quentin anymore. This is something that is expanding and you've really created a franchise. So how has that worked? Yeah, so it is really built around the franchise idea, even though we are nonprofit. I wanted to mention that Ray actually is a nonprofit and Kudos to Kruly who is our law firm who all their pro bono work to help Ray get that start. I just wanted to mention that. But yeah, it is really a franchise. We have a brand, we have a curriculum, we have a way of delivering. So we really packaged something that is very easy now to lift up in a particular state. We're doing two new classrooms that will be launching very soon. And for us to be sort of from approval to operating, we can do it within 60 days. So we can do it very quickly. But it is really built around the franchise model. And the thing is also of all this reentry, which I've ever mentioned too, that's been a component that we didn't have 10 years ago that is very much of a component of our program today. And also piggybacking off of the last question about getting involved with governments and how do you do it. It was actually the governor of Indiana, Governor Eric Holcomb, who reached out to us when he learned about the last mile in California and said, we need the last mile for the Hoosier State as part of our next level initiative. So he said a crew out. They came in, they looked at the program within six months. We had our first program in Indiana at the Indianapolis Women's Prison. Today, there are five facilities in Indiana, which we're very proud of. We also have programs in Oklahoma, which are funded by Chan Zuckerberg, the Lowebec Taylor Foundation, George Kaiser Foundation. So local funding along with big funders like Chan Zuckerberg, we launched in Kansas. Again, the department reaching out to us, Kansas Department of Corrections, and Michigan, which is also funded by Google.org. But again, I met the head of the Department of Corrections, the Lieutenant Governor came in for our launch in Oklahoma. Governor Stitt came into our launch. And so those are our five original programs. And the sixth one, which is not open today, it's not programs, but states. The sixth state to be launched is the general. No, to code it. Wow. Well, so we've got a bunch of questions that have been pouring in. One of them, a lot of people are super curious. Can you talk about the logistics of teaching the specifics of teaching coding in prison? How does it compare to what happens in a traditional class in a university? Yeah. So as I mentioned before, we have live broadcast into each classroom at least once a week. In our learning management system has all of the, in this particular program, we teach primarily front end coding, so a lot of JavaScript. And it's two six month cohorts, so the whole program is a year. The participants do not have direct access to the internet, but we do have connectivity to the classroom. So all of our content is cloud-based. We push it updates on a daily basis through their land that is distributed through their machines. So every day they get fresh content. And that's really it. The big difference is they don't have Google. So what we do now have is we have something called account or academic support reps. So we have folks that are dedicated to specific locations where I'm a student, I can provide a producer ticket, put it in the LMS. That question goes to our service reps. They answer that question or help out and send that back within 24 hours. So that's their sort of arm-length Google. Everyone on that ASR team are all graduate to the program. Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, we had some fascinating challenges teaching a class remotely. And one day a week we would have a live lecture. We were able to put together a link, a digital link between the prison, between the TLM classrooms. And in my classroom at the D school at Stanford. And so we'd one class, we're literally, you know, students were on one side of the screen on each side. And then once a week the students would have a team meeting with their partners and they would do it via Zoom. So when we were able to, they had to be monitored, but they could be in a special room where they have access. It was very cool. So Ray, there's a question for you, which is about what are the very specific marketable skills that you used and that you gained during this training? What do you go? These are the things that I learned through this program. Besides giving a fabulous pitch. Well, you know, I think that was really the biggest thing that I learned was being there was the scene we talked about my idea. And then the network, that access to the network. And you know, I think when you think about starting a business or anything, you have to, again, it's, you have to tap into something that you care about. And I think that's kind of in ache, right? And you have to have this drive for it. And so when you are introduced to, to, you know, opportunity, you know, then you can take advantage of it. So I think like being able to talk about my business and understanding the power of relationships and networks, transparency. Because when you come from a prison, like, you know, you don't want to tell everybody that you've been a prison, right? And prison, apparently did a good job of encouraging us to be transparent. Like, and that I think that was, you know, you might not say a hard skill, but that's definitely a skill set and awareness to do that, right? That was some good insight that they provided. Very interesting. So, um, someone else has another question for you having to do with, first of all, they say they love your shirt. So, uh, got a compliment on your fashion choices. I know we're all wearing black today. That's great. That's super, very powerful. Um, so the question is what piece advice would you give to, to aspiring entrepreneurs about starting up and giving what you've learned and the challenges that you faced, what advice would you give those who are eager to start something, uh, themselves? Again, uh, find something that, uh, uh, that, uh, that has purpose, right? So when times get hard, you know, uh, you could, you can lean on that, um, it, it helped you through the marathon, right? It continues to get me right. The other thing is, um, I practice, uh, I made a habit of making a self-care a practice, right? Uh, uh, getting up early in the morning, stretching for 20 minutes, meditating for 20 minutes, um, drinking water and coffee, uh, or not coffee, but T in the morning, um, uh, reading that night, those are, you know, just developed some good habits, uh, to make your day a little bit easier. Um, one of the other things that I try to do even throughout my day is breathing. I just take some time throughout the day, take a deep breath. Um, I practice, uh, like looking at an object, uh, maybe a few feet away and then paying attention, observing the space between me and that object. And I think about, you know, all the space in the universe, and it kind of, uh, centers me and it gives me back focus. So I say, you know, self-care, have some purpose and just keep going. Just don't quit. It seems like a tremendous amount has to do a mindset shift that if there's the knowledge, there's skills, but an important piece is just changing your attitude towards yourself and to the world and to the opportunities around you. So, um, clearly we have inspired a lot of people who are watching and a bed and Chris, uh, some folks are asking about what sort of volunteer opportunities are there. How can people get involved from the community to support this effort? Sure. Okay. Um, yeah. So the volunteer opportunity is, is something that's really valuable to us. You know, we have a small team today. We have 30 employees, but we do have a, like I said before, a really robust volunteer group. The best thing to do is reach out directly to info at thelastmouth.org. Someone paid attention to that. Someone would respond to that within 24 hours. Um, you know, so because of what's going on today, we don't have in-prison visits, uh, normally sort of pre-COVID. That was a pretty regular cadence for us, but we do have, as I mentioned before, we are remote into classrooms. So those classrooms that are open today, we can do that. Um, and you know, there's a help with curriculum as well. So we're constantly evolving curriculum today. We do, uh, front-end engineering. We're going to be launching an IT certification program and something we just announced last week is a, um, music and video production program that we're going to be launching. And this is going to be huge. We're going to be teaching folks to be audio technicians, video editors, and we're also going to be going across a country, um, discovering talent. Um, a good example of talent is, uh, ear hustle, which many of the folks, if they haven't listened to it, should listen to it. That was, came out of San Quentin, out of a small studio in San Quentin. So we're building a studio in our tech center as a prototype so we can discover talent and teach, uh, additional trades as well. So those are, you know, if, if people have expertise in any of those areas, uh, we'd be happy to talk to them. That is so fab-exciting. I know you guys already have a deep connection to the music industry. So, uh, what a great, uh, sort of build out of this program. I hadn't heard about that. Very, very exciting. So there are a bunch of questions about your business model. There are questions about, you know, your funding model. And someone said, do you think that you can make it into a for-profit and maybe take a percentage of, you know, the income of, you know, people who participated. I mean, have you thought about different creative funding models for this and, and what is working and what's your, what are your thoughts going forward? Yeah, I mean, we, we really, um, looked at this, coming from the venture side. What I look at company is I look at performance first, right? So once you invest you or when you're looking at a company, you have to see sort of performance metrics. And so it was important for us to do that. So we really created some performance metrics that we relied on and we got funding. We don't spend a lot of time fund raising. We spend more time, really focused on results. Could this be a for-profit? Sure, it could be. We really haven't considered that seriously. But, you know, the challenge in nonprofits is that funding is fairly short term. Normally, your commitment's maybe two, maybe three years. But when you're venture funding, you're funding out for 10 years, right? Or at least five years. So it allows you to plan and grow a little more realistically if you're a for-profit. So the model could work. We are, you know, we're sort of dedicated to the mission. And I said before that the companies that are bringing us money are also bringing us a lot of effort and it's very meaningful. So if you went that for-profit route, you may lose that. But, you know, it, the model would work there potentially. We just haven't gone down that route. So it's interesting. One of the questions was for me. And it says, what have I learned working on this program and how to change the way I work as an educator? Well, I must say it has really made me much more empathetic. I have had to really understand that people come from really diverse different backgrounds. And one of the things one of the men said when we were doing a check-in with our students and he said, how would you feel if you were judged by the worst thing you have ever done? And I just realized that, you know, everybody has things in their life that they're proud of and things that they're not and things that have affected them and that we need to treat everyone with compassion. Right now is a teacher when we're having students all over the world, some in very different conditions. My experience teaching at San Quentin has made me really understand the range of places people might be right now and the situations they might be dealing with. And so it makes me much more sensitive to that as I'm, as I'm trying to teach. So let's see, I have a lot of questions. Another one just came in. The one that came in is, how do you bounce depth providing more service to those you work with versus breadth reaching more people? So that's really interesting. You know, from day one, we decided that we wanted to prove what we did worked and then scale it as far and light as we possibly could because of the systemic issues in society and how we could make a change. So having more people in a specific facility versus having as many facilities as possible is really our goal because the ripple effect of the work is just something that is just community focus, changing families, changing communities, role models, Ray is a role model in his community. Guys who've come home and women who've come home who have jobs as software engineers, no one in their community ever even had a computer or was on a keyboard before and here they are being role models. So those are the types of things that make us believe that scale is so vitally important and we continue education once our students are back in a position where they can attend boot camps or continue their education. So it's more about reaching as far and light as we can right now, being the best we can everywhere we go and having the model just keep expanding. One thing we have done going deeper is we've got much deeper in reentry. So in job placement and there's programs like Next Chapter that we've helped spawn and we've had support from folks in the Valley like in recent Horowitz who want to cultural leaders or fund. So those things are going deeper educating inside. It's really important for us that we had pre and post gate in a sense where we continue that relationship. So that's going deeper for sure. So Ray I'd love to have your thoughts on this. I mean obviously you have this program in prison and then you go out. Do you think about what kind of programming is would be helpful to you as you through that transition but also afterwards. I mean Chris you mentioned there are some new opportunities. How does TLM fit into the larger ecosystem of support for those people who are reentering after after being in the system. So if I understand your question right, it's like what type of support do I think TLM could provide? Different support is that correct? So if that's the question I think they're working on it with the reentry piece. There are specific things that the guys need. I want to say get out. And people are taking different paths. Some people are going out. They get the coding education and they're finding jobs or they're looking at starting their own organizations to become entrepreneurs. I think there's different needs that different folks have. So just creating this network we're casking and communicating with each other and then sharing the resources that they learn on their own. Because if you're out, I would suggest don't just rely on TLM or if you go to Stanford, don't just rely on what you learned at Stanford. You still have to go outside and venture out and figure things out. There's a world opportunity out there. Don't limit yourself. But as far as I TLM, build this network so people who do find other resources can use those resources as well. So that's my own. Great. So I want to ask the last question to Beverly and Chris. And that is, you know, 10 years you've been doing this. Why would be your vision in your goal for this program for the next 10 years? 10 years. Yeah. So as Beverly said, scale is important. I mean, we have a short-term goal with the next four years who want to be in 50 classrooms. And we want to make that, you know, within at least 10 states. But we also want to have a broader program as I mentioned, we have three programs that we have or are launching soon. So the goal really is to become the de facto platform for education in prison. Because we do have a platform that we built a lot of it, what we've done for proprietary. So we've used a lot of tools. But, you know, the security and of the system and make sure that we don't have breaches. We put a lot of time and effort in IT that's specific to prison. That's, you know, it's taken us five years, we constantly iterate that. But that's a really difficult thing to do. So really it's growing what we're doing. We really think that other programs could build on top of what we're doing. So almost in an open-source environment that other programs could build on top of our platform. So yeah, so that's really how we see the next 10 years. So today we are in 21 classrooms in six states. So in 10, getting to 50 in four years, we think is highly achievable.
