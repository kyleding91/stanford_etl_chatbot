 You were listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. So we're super lucky today to have a double bill. It's very rare that we get both the venture capitalists and the entrepreneur in the room at the same time. So we have Mike Moritz, who is a legendary venture capitalist on his own. And one of his favorite entrepreneurs, Lisa Sugar, who runs Pop Sugar and all the brands associated with it. I know most of us women who spend a lot of time on it are excited to hear from her. I wanted to start today by asking a particular question inspired by Mike's book called Leading, which was published in September 2015. In your book, you say that leaders know that success comes from making a few big decisions correctly, rather than spending a lot of time being involved in many small decisions. So I wanted to ask both of you to introduce yourself and talk about some of the few really important decisions you've made in your life that have made you who you are. Oh, I get to go first. Oh, unless you're all right. Never being fast for long, these sorts of topics. I'm happy to go to the first piece. So I think whether you're running an organization or whether you're trying to wind your way through life, as you look back, there are only a few things that matter and I grew up in. I work at Sequoia Capital. I've worked at Sequoia for a very long time now. When I think of the things that mattered in my life, they're probably professionally two decisions I've made that helped bring me to this classroom today. The first was deciding to emigrate from the United Kingdom and come into the US. The second was being fortunate enough to be hired at Sequoia in the early 80s and everything else rippled out of those. If I had done neither of those things, none of the rest of my life would have worked out as it has. How did you make the first decision? It was probably very, this about leaving Britain. It was probably very similar just looking around the room at the decision that lots of people in this room made and certainly the decision made by the gentleman who gave the money to finance this center, Jensen Wang, which is that there was far more opportunity in America than there was in our respective home countries. Very good. How about yourself? Hi, I'm Lisa Sugar. I started Pop Sugar with my husband. That is one of my big life moments was actually finding the man I was going to spend the rest of my life with who I then never thought I would actually work with, but starting the company with him. I would say also moving to San Francisco because we were born and raised on the East Coast and that's in our blood. Being now here over 15 years, I wonder what life would have been like if we did not come here because I don't know if Pop Sugar would have ever existed. I think it was the opportunities that were out here on the West Coast and seeing the entrepreneurial spirit and the opportunities out here to be able to start a media company on the West Coast was because of where we were and that move. So knowing that you have a media background as a media buyer and then just love of writing these articles that eventually became your passionate company and knowing that you have a journalism background as well having written two books, one on Steve Jobs, one on Leo on the other. I love it for sight. That is a very sexist way of asking the question. Our decision about Sequoia's decision to invest in Pop Sugar was like every important investment decision that we make where at the beginning I think when we first met Lisa and Brian it was just two or three people. It was trying to imagine what would be possible if good things eventually happened and that's always a huge leap into the unknown and a decision to get into business with founders who don't know all that well at the beginning but who you hope and expect great things off and we had some experience in the sort of media related businesses on the internet and so that certainly helped inform our judgment. But it was a gradual process. It was not instant but there was clearly at the time that Lisa and Brian started the company an opportunity to create a new internet based property that was tailored to women sort of in the 18 to 40 year old demographic and so that's what and we thought there was a big opportunity there and so that's what led up to the decision. Cool, cool. And yourself you must have been looking for multiple different partners for your series and I think it was a how did you decide upon Sequoia and Mike? Yeah I think for me it was a little more love at first sight. I think knowing his track record and hearing wonderful things about people who have worked with him but the media thing was huge for me. This was my dream was to build a media company and to know that Mike's background was in journalism and that he had core attachment to that and then just even coming from New York and media is everything and the celebrities there are the editors and chiefs and the people who run the TV networks and knowing that Mike had known a lot of these people it was something I kind of looked up at that and so it was great. You were a first time entrepreneur when you were raising a series A. Yes, my husband was not. Yes, so he had had- He was a serious miscrease. He had some early successes which was great. So in the beginning we really- we were just writing and building and I started Pub Sugar on my couch and I just felt there was a void in the marketplace for a really fun, female, friendly, always updated, always needed something new. I was like addicted to writing really really fast and I knew that our audience was coming back often so I wanted to give them new content constantly. So the more I saw the numbers going up the more I kept writing and it was Brian who had come from great companies like Kmart and J. Crew and S.D. Lauderd and he saw how fast Pub Sugar was growing and he said okay I'm putting my other job and let's go you know- But you started it, it just by- Was a home and writing to you as a free friend. I wanted to get in the habit of writing every day because I loved media, I loved getting access to TV pilots for free and every magazine for free but I really wanted to start getting my own opinion out there and started to write so it really was fun for myself and to train myself and in the beginning I wasn't even telling my friends I was really doing it so when I was finding this whole audience coming to me and I knew it wasn't my core group of people that I knew who I was doing this, it was very flattering to see how quickly it was growing and it just fueled the fire for more. So you saw the market opportunity, what did you see in Lee Sun, Brian? What character traits did you see in that gave you the confidence to invest? What we see in a lot of other successful founders which is a real sense about the product or service in this case that they wanted to build and a real connection with, in this case an audience but other times you'd say customers or consumers and so that they had a real sense in purpose and they were able to explain as Lee suggested the sort of product that they wanted to build, why people would and why they were confident that there'd be lots of people that would care about. I'm going to ask a slightly more pointed question. You write about finding the people who are obsessed. How do you determine if somebody has an obsession? It's a good point and it's one that I wrote about with Alex in this book and I think it's a characteristic of the most successful entrepreneurs which is that they certainly at the beginning of their company and often for a very good long time are able to shut out the rest of the world. And just devote themselves to what they're really interested in doing and shut off all the other distractions because there's really only one thing that they care about and that care is deep and it's genuine and it's the sort of thing that they go to sleep thinking about and they wake up in the morning thinking about. Do you agree? Our first tagline for pop sure was insanely addictive and after some marketing team folks came in and said no one wants to be insane or addicted. But we just felt it really worked and I think it was what fuels just to be able to write about all the other verticals to keep going and figure out what people wanted to hear from us about and what we weren't covering and what we had in our sight and vision from the beginning and add new things that we added in along the way as well. So it's been ten years. Yes. Congratulations. You played many roles from being a founder with two or three of you in a room series A with a lot of people now and many, many more brands and now you're the president of pop sugar. How have your roles changed over the years and how have you maintained that flexibility and how has Mike guided you through those transitions? Yeah. I think what I love about it so much is it has changed. I think actually getting away from the writing was the hardest for me personally because I really enjoyed writing so much in the beginning but once all the sites were launched and we were getting bigger and we were launching a sales team and marketing and getting out there doing things like this. This is making sure that I get out and I'm not behind the scenes all the time which I really like to do. I like the nitty-gritty of deciding what the next show is that we're going to launch and who the talent is. But those are the new things. Video was something we didn't launch with and adding video to the business and learning all about how the studios work and how to create content for various places that people are going to consume it. It changes every year. It's changing for us. So it's the combination of wearing the different hats and working a lot with the different departments beyond just the edit team which is really still where I spend a lot of my time. It's still near and dear and the strategy that I want to spend a lot of time with growing that team and keeping the sites growing the way they have and growing. What have been some of the tough spots along the way? Yeah. Last ten years. I would say we were definitely slower to adapt to mobile. I'd like to always say that probably every board meeting Mike would pick up his phone and be like, what's next on this? We're like, well, they're already reading it on the phone. But really being a mobile first, mobile centric across the board. So whether the site is easy to read, whether we have a subscription box, that's a monthly subscription box, whether you can purchase that really easily. All the integration into our shop style site and making it easy to shop from the phone, as well as the editors thinking about grabbing you with that headline while you're running down on your come-on commute or going to get lunch or in the elevator getting all your news, really adapting to thinking about mobile first. I think it's probably the biggest, we're a little slower to that. But we're now 70% of our audience comes from mobile, so we're figuring that out. But early on, we had a distribution partner early on in the company that sales and distribution partner and then making the decision to build our own sales force. That was a tough and wrenching decision. Yeah, why was it a tough and wrenching decision? Well, we were really excited about concentrating on the content and building the audience. But then you want to have revenue, right? And we really wanted to be a profitable company. And so we wanted to bring sales in-house. And that's an expensive undertaking to build a sales team. But one that has been wonderful for us and we are profitable. So it's been for five years. And how has Mike, what has your relationship been like? Because we oftentimes don't talk about, we celebrate when around is raised and then we celebrate that. What has a relationship been like in the past ten years along the way? It's, there Mike is a wonderful partner. So it's the first time we meet here. Right. That is lying. We're an important meeting yesterday. We're all actors. No, it's been great. We have lots of board meetings. But not too many. And Mike is always there in between any official meeting for advice that we need helping recruit talent, helping connect us to people that we want to work with. All wonderful ways. But no mistake about it. This is Brian and Lisa's company and they deserve 110% of the credit. He's very supportive. That's important. So what's next? Ten years, what do the next ten years look like? Well, I turned in a book today. So that is a big project that I was very excited to be working on. And again, seeing how Mike has been successful with his books and talking to an audience of 1834, the women and the needs that they come to us for, you know, we wanted to get a book out there to talk to them about a lot of the stuff that they advice that they want. So it wins that coming in? Hopefully by September. Title. We're still working on it. It's same ideas to this. Yes. Aiming on work hard played nice. Which is kind of our mantra. And you know, basically how to power your happy. Power your happy is another theme we talk a lot about. Our content powers a lot of people's happy. So kind of that how to find your route to living your best life. And yeah, so the book is a big thing. Video is still really big for us. So looking at other places to have video distributed, creating scripted, going on Netflix, something down that route. We have another business called Shop Style, which is an amazing search tool. If you guys are ever looking to buy anything specific, you go to it. You say, you know, black and white pumps. And I get every shoe from SACS, Nordstroms, Forever 21, Neemans, J Crew. And then you can get sale alerts. It's very, very easy to use. For men. For men. For men and women. Yes. And children and furniture. Pretty much anything. So. And we have excellent retail partners. We send a lot of traffic to the Neemans to targets of the world. So building out that business and making it even easier for you because we all know we want the InstaCarts and the Amazon Primes and that instant gratification. So making it even easier. And also our editors are writing stories all day long about what you need, whether it's the latest gene or some new hot trend that's happening. So just to integrate it all in and make it seamless is our goal. Tell me a company that you really admire. Oh, I love Disney. Disney is one of those companies I just think going back to our mantra even of powering your happy. There's a lot of overlap there. And I think what they do, whether it's the experience of actually being in the park or them creating content, to merchandise, they figured out lots of ways to make money and keep their stay true to their vision and their mantra and their values. And I think that that's a company that I look at that does a great job. I love what you had to say about work hard and play nice. How does that get implemented day to day? Like you're the founder, the head of this company, you and Brian have run it. And how do you make sure that that is lived out? I mean, we're in it. We're in it with everyone. We sit with everyone, Brian's favorite thing. I would like to think it's a nice family vacation, but it's really a hackathon. I mean, if you sent him away to just go and code, he's the happiest man. So really just being in it with everyone. And as we grow, we're 450 people now. And really still trying really hard to have a company culture that feels like a family when Mike walked through the door 10 years ago. Our daughter Katie was born like the first day. She came two weeks early, which was really the first day of training at our house with our founders. And I went into labor. And she came to the office with us for the first three years. And so that whole family culture that we have and the fact that Brian and are there together every day, we really try to have that feeling go through. But at the same time, we are obsessed with this job and this company that we're building. So we are always on and working really hard and we expect the same from our team. And finding people who are really passionate to join the team and be a part of it and help us grow. I also read that Pop Sugar is 60% or more women? 75% women? Oh, I'm sorry. We are a lot of ladies. Yes. Our 75% women, our exec staff, is for 50-50 engineers or 30% women. Women have a longer time with us. They're the 10 year with us longer with us. So yeah, a lot of girls. Poor Brian, we have three daughters, a female dog. And he gets to work with the 10 year pregnant women. So one of the reasons we changed our colors from pink to blue. But I'm just wondering here, hope some dreams for Pop Sugar in the next 10 years. A little continues, at least it's doing what it's doing. And as it's done very steadily and predictably for a good long time, carving out a larger position in the evolving landscape of media, focused on the demographic that companies long been dialed into. You've acquired a lot of companies in the last 10 years. How do you look for great companies to acquire to be, come part of your family? That's a good question. Brian is definitely more, that's like a more fun project for him. I would say than myself. But it's finding same things that Mike had mentioned earlier, finding people who are really obsessed about something, feeling a need that we might have. So whether it's great technology on the shop style end and finding engineers or doing great things from the shopping search capabilities to we bought a company called Circle of Moms years ago, because our audience is really young. And we knew that the mom audience is really great for sales. And so bringing them into our fold was a great audience builder for us for moms. Awesome. Yeah. Before I open up for questions from the audience, I have one more question for you. You have 500 students sitting in the audience. Think back to when you were in college. Many, many years ago, like me. I couldn't get credit just sitting through a monthly afternoon without a note pad, checking out my Facebook feed. Not good. To Shay. If you were sitting in the audience, what would you tell your younger self? If you could go back to that time and give yourself a piece of advice. Three words. What's that? Three words. Three words, all right. Follow your instincts, which is very easy to say, the incredibly difficult to do. A little more context. Everybody, when they're wondering about what they should do after college or after university, you have the weight of expectations on your shoulders. You have college bills that you might have to pay. You have parents who have expectations for you in a particular direction. And whether you like it or not, subconsciously, you carry all that stuff with you. And if you want to go in a different direction from what you've been spent your, the previous 20, 25 years of your life, almost being programmed to go and do, that's a very difficult thing to do. How about you, Lisa? I think for me, it's more that it's just okay if you don't have it figured out yet. I mean, you know, when I left college, the internet barely started. So the job that I would create for myself, there's no way I would have known that that's what I was going to do. And I didn't know 100% what I wanted to do yet. So I think really it's also, it's trying new things and just getting yourself out there and experimenting and figuring out what it is you're gravitating towards and liking and then follow that direction. Thank you. Well, I'm going to open it up to the floor for questions. Do we have a mic? So how it works? Okay. I speak loudly and clearly. Let's start with the program. I have a question for you now. So I believe pop sugar, we want people to be really engaged with that website. You want them to come back. You want more people to come back to your website, right? So internally, how do you figure out the user behavior? Like how can you keep them more engaged? Yeah. How do you internally figure out what's the mechanism? How do you figure that out that 20% of the audience, like this kind of stuff, 30% like this? How do you figure that out? I think, you know, we definitely do a lot of deep dives on content. We're looking at what people are excited about when they come. But then even just engineering the page appropriately to have related stories and bubble up content around that they would be interested in having never ending galleries so they can go right into one story to the next. We also have more of what we're calling a push strategy this year as opposed to a pull. So a lot of us are getting a lot of our audience to come to us through search and through social. So we're pulling them in. But now we want to push out to you. So, you know, email has been around forever and existed. But even just like push notifications. So getting more people to download our app so that we can, you know, give you news alerts throughout the day on your watch and your phone is something that we are constantly testing now, actually. I think a more particular question would be, do you guys do big data analysis on the comments that user make on your website? Yes. So yes, so we do. We need to question. You want to know if we do big data analysis on the comments? On the comments. So I would say each editor is looking at all aspects of their story and they will go in and look specifically at what people are reacting to and will follow trends. And we have lots of ways that we can look at that. On the shop style side, we can definitely play more with the big data and what people are searching on and where they're clicking and go down that. Okay, so you manually actually do the big data analytics. If I wrote an article, you manually do one check it. Like what people are commenting, right? Something about that. Sorry. Yes. If it's a story. Thank you. Good. Uh, question for Mike. Sequoia aside, what's, what do you see the role of like metric app was tweeting and posting on social media and that takes into that activity to the firm's success? Uh, question is the connection between eventually firm being active on social media and its success. It'll be quite a long time before anybody's going to be able to answer that question because social media is a marketing platform is fairly recent in the grand scheme of things and obviously Sequoia was around a long time before. The web came along and the social media and mobile and everything else. I think it's easy to get distracted by the sound of the trumpet and what matters eventually is the quality of the investment decisions that are made. And the acuity with which those are made. And it's somewhat similar to, you know, the analogy that people used to make when newspapers were read more frequently than they are today, which is not to get sucked up into believing your own headlines. And so I think, especially in this sort of today's era, humility also goes a long way, particularly in a business as humbling as the investment business or the venture business, which if you don't make the decisions correctly, can hand you out to a right royal spanking no matter how high your public profile. Excellent. Let's do the one in the back, red shirt with stripes. Loudly. I'm not going to solve for your Stanford, but I was intrigued that you, that you, that this needs a company that you admire. Our firm is at a 30-year-old chip with Disney, Ashley Ann Swini, who is the spuis, and if no Ann or not, she's actually my daughter's godmother. If you'd like that introduction. I'd be great. I'd love to meet with you. Thank you. Thank you. Let's do one more from the back. The wild cards. The young man in the white shirt. You mentioned that culture was late to mobile. It sounds like you're pushing to go there. Are there any innovations or trends you'll see that you've been pushing media companies to get on? Do you have a relative you can introduce me to? Well, one thing we talked about yesterday when we all met, Pao Chug is what we're doing to address this. Huge phenomenon of, you know, Twitch game streamers. And there's a big, you know, that is not a masculine preserve. And so that's an audience and an activity that is enormous and growing. And I think Lisa and the other editors agree that we could be doing more on that. So I think staying alert just as the companies are done over the last decade and not getting blindsided by a new trend like this. That just seemingly comes out of nowhere in the last 18 months and getting on it very quickly. And just remaining, the most important thing to do is to remain vigilant about these new sorts of opportunities. Because it's easy to fall asleep at the wheel as they pop along. Cool. Please. Professor, yes. Tom Kostnick, Michael, thank you for everything that you've done for the Valley since you came here. I'll say no more than that. I met Michael the first time when he agreed to be interviewed for a case of a Yahoo. Accepting his first round of capital and then him dazzling. Masio, she saw and who said, well, how much do you think Yahoo is worth? And Michael said $500 million. And Masio, she's son was a flabbergast. I guess these days people say $500 million is at all. But you have been guiding entrepreneurs for a long time and I just want to thank you for that. Thanks, Tom. It's not me, it's Sequoia. I'm lucky enough to be part of Sequoia. But now could I jump to Lisa? Did you go to see yes? I did not. Brian, my husband did. I went last year. Who's writing the Uber? Because there was somebody who looks like it might have been you writing the Uber. No, no, no, no, no, Uber. Erby, erby, sorry. It's a little electric scooter. It was definitely not me. The general question is when you were trying to think about what's happening, is CES interesting? Yes. How do you figure out what's most interesting? Because the article that you wrote was quite interesting, right? So we have editors. How do we think about CES when we go, and is it interesting to us? Yes, it's a consumer electronics show because that everybody knows that. Yes. So the consumer we have covered it from an editorial point of view. But how do we look at the consumer electronics show? Is that something that's important to pop sugar? And we look at it two ways. We send an editorial team who is covering the trends and the products that are there, and how they would relate to women 18 to 40, and how we'll be excited about new things that will be introduced in our lives. So female journalists there in a predominantly male space. And then we also go from a corporate perspective where I mean, it's now just a meeting ground where all CEOs and teams are meeting about trends and doing panels and so on. So Brian and I sort of divide and conquer a lot of times there are key things that we do go together last year. I did go with him, but this year I let him. That's like you go to see a share, so he handled that. Let's see. The lady with the red and black shirt. This question is, I guess we're both going to put some early on this. What are some of the ways you've navigated the challenge of running a profitable media company in the Internet age when the mentality is that high quality content should really be created? Yes. We are definitely, we like to still run like a startup, which I know is hard as we are as largest we are. We have a wonderful CFO who actually attended this school. And he likes to, he's cautious and he wants us to be able to take risks and invest in stuff. But there are times when we definitely have started a project and realized this isn't for us. We shouldn't go down this route anymore. And let's just concentrate on the core, which is the content and our great shopping tool and make it as wonderful as we can for our audience. Try not to ruin the experience by taking too many ads. You don't want to ruin the experience for the reader. On the side, yes. I think I have any disagreements as we see as an entrepreneur. What's the general vote? What has been the power they have to give to you? And how did you resolve when you first disbanded? Well, it's two against one, so there's no right to necessarily do that. No, I think it's been very antelicable. Okay. Let's go to the back. The man in the light blue shirt. I believe it's happened to us. Yeah, so I just have a question for you. Do you believe that there will be another Steve Jobs that will happen in the next five to ten years as life? That's it. No. Any more than I believe there will be another Larry Page or Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates. They're each very distinctive personalities. Now, if the question is, is there somebody that whose name we don't know today, who 20 years from now will be very well known because of the company that he or she started? Absolutely, yes. So, earlier, you guys talked about big decisions that you've got, right? I'm curious. Could you tell us about the big decision that you think you've got around? Big decision we got around. Well, I can think of investment decisions, like you've got around. Too many to... As far as, like... I mean, when we started the sites, we had an original vision of 12 sites that we wanted to launch. And we realized shortly that there were certain burcles that weren't an everyday read. So, I would say that there were certain things that we restructured to make the content package the right way. That's not really. Actually, I'm curious. Mike, if you would talk about an investment decision that... Oh, I was going to say... It's like Web Van, or... Thank you for bringing that up, family. It's a two-syllable company that's going to hold... You know, Web Van, we invested in this company, Web Van. And sometimes, you know, people say, well, you know, what's going to happen in the end? I always tell people that I'm going to get cremated. And they say, why are you going to get cremated? Because I said, I don't want to have a tombstone that reads, Heal lines, the idiot who invested in Web Van. Yeah, so that was, fortunately, however, we got one thing right in the Web Van investment 17, 18 years ago, which is the incredible, insatiable consumer demand for delivery at home for groceries. And fortunately, have recovered from that. And now, many years later, very, very happy investors in a company called Instacart, which serves this area down here. And if you haven't tried it, you should, because it's everything that Web Van wanted to be 17 years ago. And as Lisa, who is a very happy customer, said softly just then, and far more, because of the acuity of the founder, but also the advances in technology. But Web Van is the investment that will always hold. So when you say that not all this bad decisions are bad, there's a silver lining to some of the bad decisions that were made. There's learnings. There are learnings. Yeah. There is nothing worse to invest in Zia than this has been a learning experience. Because what that really means is this has been a really costly and expensive experience. All right, in the orange shirt. Thank you. I'm Lawrence. Thank you for being here. Lisa, what do you think about the new generation, the generation Z? And Mike, what are your challenges, what do you think, or what would you like to do better? I love the next generations. I love hiring youth and studying them. I think that. I think that. Huh? I think it's fascinating. I think the idea that they consume a lot more, they share a lot more. They're just very fast, instant gratification, relatability, personalization, all that stuff. A lot of that is a lot of the core of what Pop Shrugger started with when we started. And wanted to be, you know, a in the know source that came across as a girlfriend. And not in the know. And or not, you know, know it all. So in the know, but not know it all. And I think that that's how they want to be talked to. And they want, you know, I love how diverse it is and how open people are to all shape sizes, colors, everything. It's great. And I think that, you know, it's only going to get better. So we're totally embracing it and love it. It's like. Red Stanford hoodie. Hey, thanks for the top here. Michael, I'm wondering what would you say are the less obvious reasons why Sequoia is still the top of the venture capital world. And by obvious, I mean, correct and found wrong, but maybe you would say team and network. Are there some other reasons that you see that he's the QIA up there? Well, that's a very nice question. Thank you. A question was, why do I think Sequoia is the preeminent venture firm? I don't. I think I think I always feel we're always one step away from going out of business. And that we can never take anything for granted. And that we're only as good as our next investment. And we can never be good enough. You have a lot of fans. Second row. Thank you. Question. So a question came up earlier around what is the next 10 years look like. And how do you what what happens when a company a wildly successful, profitable company wants to remain private and independent. But for a venture firm that has a 10 year life and has to return capital to its needed partners. How do you think about that next 10 years if you've been involved already 10 years? The question was does a company like Pop Sugar where we've been an investor for a long time. Does the design of a 10 or 12 year venture partnership mean that we have to sell our shares? Fortunately, the investors in Sequoia, entities that we call limited partners, they're very relaxed about it. So if we feel that there are companies of which where we want to continue holding the shares inside the partnership, they're very comfortable allowing us to do that. And we've done that on a on a number of occasions because I think all of us, the limited partners in Sequoia, realize that pressing question was what happens to venture funding when interest rates go up. It's no accident that in the world of alternatives doesn't matter where you look, it can be the oil and gas industry, it can be the venture industry, it can be the real estate industry. The flood of capital into the private portion of those businesses since interest rates have come way down has risen because everybody, everybody's looking for returns on their investment. As interest rates move up, the capital will retreat. And if you're asking me when is that going to happen, I have no idea. But obviously as interest rates go up and people feel that they can get reasonable returns with far less risk or perceived risk, then the money will retreat out of the private markets. Okay, I'm going to have three more questions. So second row. Yes. Hi. So you've always advised college freshmen and pretty much everybody to follow their instincts, but do you think that's more of like an intuitive thing? Or is it something that can actually be pushed up with experience or taking risks? The question was the advice I offered, I don't know whether it's good or bad, that people should follow their instincts, whether I could say a little bit more about that. I think it helps if you try and enter an environment where you think you can learn a lot. And whether that's inside an organization, doesn't have to be a company, it can be some other organization, or around people that you particularly admire that you can learn a lot from. And I think that just helps expand one's horizons and also gives the individual a sense of what excellence is really like. If you pick the right setting or the right set of individuals and done right, it's a transformative set of experience. I think that that, yes, surround yourself with great people and try new things. Absolutely. Right, round the purple. Thanks, Sarah Michael. What would Silicon Valley executives learn from Sarah? And by first. And as I got to know him and as we were writing the book together, it struck me that the sort of attributes of leadership that he has and demonstrated for so long, a very, very similar to the attributes that you see among the very best company founders in Silicon Valley. And it was also pretty apparent to me. And this may sound too bland for everybody. I wish there was a bigger surprise that the characteristics of leadership is embodied in an individual. Whether you're running a soccer club in the north of England in the rain or a technology company in Cupertino in the sunshine. And a very, very similar. There are some differences, obviously, I think hiring people in his pursuit is, or retaining people in his pursuit is a lot easier than it is in Silicon Valley, his business. The business of soccer is a much slower business moving business than the world of technology. So there are some differences. But I sent the book to, there's a very, very famous, he's one of my heroes called, he was an early, the leader, one of the leaders of the first generation of venture capitalists who invested in Apple and Intel. And he was the first, you know, first investors in the early investors in both of those companies. And he's a young man called Arthur Rock. And he's in his 80s now. He wrote me a very sweet note last week. And he said, I just finished the book. And I would hire, Alex Ferguson to run any company in which I was an investor. Very cool. All right. Last question. In the white. Perhaps it fits you specific question, but based on your experience, how realistic do you think for us start up to be able to do VTC and VDB at the same time? And this is an early step. How realistic is it for a company to do VTC and VDB at the same time? I'm sure there are examples of companies that have pulled it off. And I just think right at the beginning you have to concentrate on doing one thing super well. And once you've done that, the second thing becomes easier, particularly if you're dealing with... It's one thing to sell precisely the same product to both audiences. And if you can do that, bless you heart. It's a good thing to do. But I think it's very... if you've got to tailor the product differently, I think that's a very dangerous thing for a company to do right at the start. You know, it's no coincidence, obviously, that Apple under Steve Jobs was not prepared to compromise, to change and alter its products to please corporations. They would build products and if corporations wanted to buy them, so be it. They weren't going to come up with special products. And it was an approach that obviously served them very well. And then there's, you know, there are plenty of examples of other companies that have over time succeeded in with two different sorts of distribution channels. Plan two. To the two of them separately. And we'll see you next week. You have been listening to the Draper Fisher-Jurvis and entrepreneurial thought leader series.
