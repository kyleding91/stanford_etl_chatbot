 You were listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at edcorner.stanford.edu. What I'd like to do is welcome two entrepreneurs who are alumni of Stanford and who are entrepreneurs who really have got a project that I think is one of the coolest things happening on the Internet. It's called the Experience Project. Now Arman, who is the founder, is a Mayfield Fellow. He's an alumnus Stanford and a very wonderful guy. He even took my marketing class and survived. And the success of the Experience Project has nothing to do with the fact that he took global entrepreneurial marketing. We're glad you took it. And we're glad you're back. In addition to Arman, employee number two of the Experience Project is another Stanford grad. Julio, if you look at his background, you'll see that he's quite a global citizen. He's worked in various parts of the world. He got his undergraduate degree at a pan, at a wonderful program that they got there. Went to monitor and then came to Stanford to graduate school of business. And then was doing some entrepreneurial things before meeting Arman. So Julio and Arman, I hope one of the things you do as you kick off is explain how YouTube guides met. That's all always fun. And I'm going to get off the stage and let you all take it away. Julio will be interviewing Arman as part of this. And we're delighted to have you here. So welcome back to Stanford, both of you. Thanks. Thanks, Tom. It's really a pleasure for both of us to be back at Stanford. We're really looking forward to this session. I think we can learn a lot from you and your questions. So thanks for having us. I think Tina asked me to be kind of the guest interviewer today because I started a podcast called I Innovate when I was back here at Stanford. And through that, got to interview a lot of entrepreneurs. And I think that Arman really was someone that stood out from a lot of the people that I met. And I really wanted to come here today and share the story of experience project through Arman, who's really one of the most passionate and devoted founders I've ever met. We initially met through one of the advisors of experience project, a great woman by the name of Fern Mandelbaum, who has been both a great coach and advisor to Arman and the experience project. And we met back in the spring of this year at a Starbucks in Redwood City where Arman really first told me about the experience project. And it was just one of those, hey, you guys should just meet. You should get to know each other. I think you're going to hit it off. We never thought anything. Or at least I didn't think anything was going to come of it. But really, I think I ended up kind of that one hour chat really thinking, this is where I want to work after I graduate. There's kind of no other startup that I think is as interesting and other founder that I think is as compelling as Arman. So it really is a pleasure to help Arman share that story with you guys today. So hopefully we can try to replicate a little bit of what that first meeting was. Just a chat and hear the story of what Arman went through, hear a little bit more about the experience project and a lot of the things that he learned as a first time founder here in Silicon Valley. So welcome, Arman. Maybe you can start out by telling us a little bit about what is the experience project? Okay. Before I get down that path, I just want to go a little bit of this. Thank you for having me back. It's a really great honor to be back in this position. I took him any finals in this class. I felt asleep many times in this class. Very comfortable, Jared. So I hope to avoid that. But I think one of the unique perspectives that we'll bring is, you know, a young entrepreneur that's gone through the very same things that you've gone through, in the routes, the classes, the mentalities, the questions. And as we're talking about the items that we'll talk about here, I want you to be thinking about, you know, what are the things that you're facing as you think about entrepreneurship and how it might impact your life. I feel free to bring that up in the Q&A and certainly afterwards, I'm happy to take any questions. So getting back to Julia's question, thank you for the flattering introduction. Extreme-Rise project beyond being a very, very long domain name, but it has all of its vowels. So we avoided the Web 2.0 stigma there, the price of arthritis that we picked up, typing it in. But it's a site essentially based on experiences. What we do is we bring people together based on their shared life experiences in order to build very customized support groups and friendship groups around people. So there's a lot of abstract terms, what does that really mean? It's probably best given by a visceral example. So just in the last two weeks we had a woman join the site. She was a young mother. Her husband is in a military in Iraq, so he was deployed and she was diagnosed with breast cancer and she was undergoing chemotherapy. So this is a woman who felt very isolated. She has a series of things going on her life that were all experiences that had basically let her do, you know, in her social circle. She was blessed to have people around her, her friends and family. They cared. They gave her what I would say, generic compassion. You know, you know, will be there for you. We'll help you through this. Really what she needed to do is talk to people that were in her exact shoes. She came on the site, she signed up, she shared a few of these experiences and that's really the architecture of the site. And within hours she had people around her that weren't just military wives, weren't just cancer patients, weren't just mothers, but all of that combination. She met up with them essentially on the site. She was able to know one. She's not alone and two to draw strength and support from people that have the most credible possible interactions with her because they've been there. So that's what we do in a very generic way. So maybe you just tell us a little bit more about how someone actually uses experience projects. Kind of what does that look like when someone shows up at the site? What do they do? Right. So when you come to the site, anonymity is a key characteristic of our site. We talk about all about how important that is in the end. But what people these they sign up, we take very, very limited information from them just to get them participating. And you don't want to have just drive by anonymity. You do want them to register on the site just because people take ownership and they're less likely to misbehave in that sense. But we just take some broad demographics, are you male or female? What is your age range? And then we just say what are the five things that you consider to be definitive of you? Right. Maybe you're a Stanford student, maybe you're a law student, maybe you're battling a particular health illness or a relationship issue, and you express those items out there. And then those form essentially the network nodes of our product. So on Facebook or Myspace, you know, I know you, you know another person. People are the nodes on our site. What we do is we have the experiences form the nodes between people. So someone is a multiple-square-osus patient and they happen to be a single mother. Those form different nodes. We use those to interconnect people that are more similar. So essentially what we do. One of our advisors and investors is Steve Blank. Some of you are taking class with him. The interesting thing he says when you're designing a product is you really don't want to recreate, or you don't want to create something brand new on the internet. When you're building a social site, particularly, you want to do sort of echo what's been going on in human nature since caveman fire times. So since the fires, people have always been wanting to connect with people to understand them. That's just common sense why we get together, dinner with friends. And over time, what you want to do with us is make that process more efficient, more fun to bring people together. There's a thousand people you passed by today. Any one of those people could have been a very good friend. Had you known which one of those people to talk to, what questions to ask, and how they've been comfortable enough answering those questions. So what we do is we essentially make this whole system this need to be understood, this desire to connect with people to get us a simple and efficient. Alright, so we got anonymity. We have experiences as nodes. We have people connecting in a community meeting new people that they wouldn't otherwise have met. Sounds like something that was pretty unique. I think that's definitely the first reaction I had when I heard about this. How do you come up with something like this? What are the idea of experience project come from? I think for most entrepreneurs, it's got to be driven by passion. Here's this over and over again. But entrepreneurship will just completely take it out of you. Every last good out of you said, it has to come from something real. For me, about five years ago, I found out someone very close me was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. So hopefully many of you know very little about this illness, but it tends to strike young women in their early 20s. It's a disease of the central nervous system and brain. People get inflammation in their brain, the central nervous system. And it can lead to paralysis, it can lead to cognitive issues, it can lead to nothing. I just sort of wear the so-called look at the draw where you get these inflammation happening. So this person was diagnosed and prognosis was just sort of, well, you know, best time ever to have MS better than 10 years ago, but we really don't know what's going to happen to you. I think that was just a really huge burden to put on someone. I wanted to help. I'm not a doctor, but I am really good at using the internet. So I was able to find a database online called PubMed.gov where all peer-reviewed research gets piped into from college all the way up to the biotech world. And neurology and in particular MS is a huge treatment opportunity. MS strike young women, so you have a 60-year treatment horizon. It doesn't affect lifespan in general, it affects life quality. So it's a monstrous opportunity, if you're looking at it from my perspective. So dozens of studies are getting published every week. Of those studies, most of them 98% or really mouse model, petri dish, long time in the future. Nothing that could impact a patient, you know, perhaps even in their lifetime. But there are a small set that people could actually implement in their lives in the near term. Could it be a vitamin regimen that improves fatigue? Could it be an exercise regimen that improves festicity? I started focusing on those things, pulling them out, educated myself on what those were. And I rewrote these medical abstracts, and if you ever played around with these abstracts, I've written in jargon for almost no reason besides being in jargon. And so I was able to just turn them into more about stories that a patient might understand. And I was like, why not just share this with the world? I created a website called ThisIsMS.com. And I just started writing about four or five times a week about the things I was finding in the research world with the charter that I would inspire hope and MSP patients by knowing about what else was out there besides what the FDA was approving on every five, 10, 15-year horizon. So as time went on, Google brought traffic for the content. I was using a software packaging solution, sort of these for two of the things that happened. I was using a publishing solution that had a form attached to it. And I thought nothing of it when I was building the site out. It was all about the content, and I thought. And as people came for the content, that was interesting to them reading these stories, was helpful. Really the power of the site, though, was unleashed on that forum. Because MS, in particular, is silent illness. People don't even tell their close family members they have it. So for them to come onto a community where everyone else understood their predicament was incredibly empowering. They could talk about their symptoms, they could talk about their struggles, their psychological issues, dealing with this kind of burden. And that was amazingly powerful. It brought people together across gender lines, across international lines. People were checking in on each other after appointments. And he was amazingly powerful. And it was by nature anonymous. It wasn't by choice. It's just the software was really limited. And the anonymity allowed them to talk. That was a good part of it. But over time, I started to see how this actually could also be very negative. First of all, these people, young women in general, had so many things going on in their lives, right? The perhaps started your jobs, new careers, new families, et cetera. Yet this site was all about MS, and the fact that they were an MS patient. I think it's very unfair for any illness, any relationship, whatever, just say you're a divorcee, you're a cancer patient, et cetera. There's more things going on. And I thought that could actually enrich the conversation. So I think on any forms, it's sort of endemic. And that the topic of the form is what people will discuss, make sense. And then the details that actually might add richness to the conversation, you might find out another woman with MS in your neighborhood, that would be buried, like, you know, through at 57, you know, post 63, it might be very repetitive as it keep being brought up. So it's being left on the sidelines. Another thing that really bothered me is that as hopeful as we try to make our community, based on research, it should have been very hopeful, it's still skewed to the negative. I think any health community skews to negative because who's posting on health sites is people who are not feeling well. If you're doing well, one, you're probably out doing something besides sitting in front of a health site. And two, perhaps you don't want to be the survivors syndrome kind of thing where you're there going, hey, I'm doing great, you know, it's terrible to be you guys and you're predicting what I'm doing fine. So I was frustrated by those things and I started to gel the idea of everyone in their world faces a so-called MS in their lives be it a health issue, be it a relationship, issue be what school to go to, we're talking to another person that's been there and has many things in common with you can inform that decision and discussion. And so why not start pulling away from just focusing on health and just let everyone express themselves the way they want to express themselves and bring that same connection and the depth that was missing, the depth that was missing from the MS site to basically pocket with the large. So at this point, what's going on in your personal life? You know, what are you doing and how do you make the step from whatever you're doing to actually decide to go out there and start experience project and start this company? So as Tina mentioned, I'm actually Tom Mitch and I was a Mayfield fellow and so I actually ended up working at my Mayfield company full-time which was actual incorporation, I was a phenomenal incorporation and to show you how small the world it was, my boss was Tina's husband. So it's pretty amazing. And at a great time there was an amazing job, I was a product manager, I launched a product from paper to hundreds of thousands of units shipped that traveled the world Amsterdam and New Zealand were my areas of work so not a bad time at all. And the MS site was in the background, I was working on it just on weekends and nights and my primary responsibility was to my company. But as I was working on an experienced project and I just started to join around with the code and building it out, I saw the potential here. So this is a massive business opportunity. It's also a massive ability to help tons and tons of people, many times exponential to what the MS site had done. And I had to start coming to grips with the idea that I might need to leave this amazingly great job. It was not a quick job, I worked my butt off. But it was, you know, high paying and I got traveling, I got to go that. So coming to the decision was actually extremely difficult and I think many of you will face that. And I remember, you know, the day that you finally come to grips with leaving a good job is when basically, as Stanford students we always fight to keep all doors open, right? Opportunity is the most important thing to us. We kill ourselves to make sure all of our options are open to us. And you have to realize when you're about to start a company, you're going to violently close almost all the doors in your life and you're just going to chase one of them. And that's not really much of an exaggeration. It's the day that you come to realize that the door you chase with your passion and with your company is actually more valuable and the doors it will open is more valuable and outweighs the doors that you'll be closing that you can actually figure out and see is the day that you can leave your company. So with that being said, it sounds wonderful. But the moment I was about to walk into Microsoft as I had panic attack basically, like, am I really going to do this? I ran to the parking lot and I called up a good friend of mine, Lucas Ryan, who is now a co-founder of another company called Mogad. He had just left his job very similar circumstances and I literally had like a child's conversation with him. Lucas is this going to be okay? Am I going to be all right? Am I going to be able to eat? I'm going to move into my parents. Like, what's going to happen? And he was like, you'll be fine. It'll be okay. Not a very emotional guy, but a cool company that started. And so I walked in and I basically said, this is what I wanted to do and Mike was amazing about it, understood. He had been an entrepreneur himself and it's one thing you'll obviously is entrepreneurs love other entrepreneurs because it's, hey, you share that experience, you have to share that mentality, to share something huge. So it's a hard decision once you've committed to it. It goes very quickly. So you were asking, Lucas, am I going to be able to eat and we're going to feed myself? When you get to that point, you have a great idea, you're really passionate about it. You know, jobless and you don't have any income. How do you now take that and make it a real company with employees and office, you know, post box, whatever else you need to have? How do you raise money? What does that look like? Right. So that's a far reaching type question. I think the first thing you face when you leave your job and your paycheck and your health insurance is, how are you going to fill in that gap? Right? Because some people will take the stance that running out of money and depleting your bank account will spur you to work even faster and harder. I'm not necessarily of that camp because I feel like I would worry so much about that issue. It would outweigh any benefit I got from driving myself harder. So I actually was lucky enough to be offered a consulting position at my old company. And I can never be thankful enough for what that was. I would just go in once or twice a week and help them out with some of their marketing initiatives. It paid some of my bills and gave me some peace of mind in that sense. But also it's a trade-off and I'd love to talk about this, perhaps, in the Q&A session. It's a huge trade-off because psychologically you're still now splitting your mind across two different things. I don't think any of us cut corners in this room. So you have to face that demon. In my case, I'm really happy with the way it worked out. So once you do that, I just had enough runway to start working on this. And I worked on it by myself, literally in a room with a laptop, a $400 laptop that I still have for two years. I just plugged away, plugged away and coded, made sure it worked. Bit by bit, I would release it, get feedback and roll it back into the main product. And I pushed this all the way to about October of 2006. And sometimes Fortune strikes you. I was at a party that happened to have a reporter from CNET there and I mentioned what I was doing vaguely. The next day he wrote a two-page article on it without letting me know. So suddenly people were coming to this very, very, very pre-alpha site. And it was exciting and amazing. And I think the email that I sent out forwarding to everyone had 4,000 exclamation points in it. Like, check this out on one CNET. But at the same time, that goes very quickly and you realize I've got to actually back up what I've built or I could blow it. So at that point, I decided to double my team and bring on another person who is a Nilshath, who's a great engineer from Stanford. Actually, the SCS, MSN, MSN, as many of you are, too. So he joined me in October and then we just basically decided no more publicity. Let's make sure this product works before we get another round of press. And then we pushed as far as we could without payment until April of this year actually. And at that point, we decided to raise a small angel round. So what was that fund raising? Like, what is it like to raise money from angels? Any advice you have? How did that work? So the fund raising process is always lengthy, right? We had a really hot product and people really liked it, but it still takes much longer than you think. And you end up meeting tons and tons of people and having lots and lots of meetings. So it's a really intricate process. I was, you know, one of the things you'll learn is that Silicon Valley seems like this really huge place, but really it's about 150 people that make all the decisions and have all the money and have all this way. So if you can meet one of them, one of them believes in you, they'll introduce you to all the rest. Honestly, everyone knows everyone else. And it's a great checks and balances system as well because that 150 is just a cream of the crop type of people. So I was introduced to a friend I'd actually worked with in a internship early on when I was a freshman at Stanford. He knew an angel investor by the name of Mike Mabel's. Some of you may know him as a rising star. He was behind Dig, Congregate, aggregate knowledge, and a great guy. And we had just met very alone when I had the idea for Experience Project. And then when I was able to go back in April, I had a product and I had a bigger team. And showing that credibility is all the difference in the world. One of the things that you struggle with as a first-time entrepreneur and a young entrepreneur is credibility gap, credibility gap, credibility gap. As much as you think you're the smartest person in the world, and you got a great idea, the fact is all investors see tons of ideas on a daily basis from really smart people. And you start to value the participants, the team, almost more than the idea at times. Sometimes you can make a really bad movie and if a really famous movie stars in it, it's still going to make money, right? Or says a brilliant artsy film. And that's one thing that you have to constantly overcome is that credibility gap. The fact that we had a product, the fact that we had achieved something, and everything that we had said we would achieve, and then some was able to get us to open the door to Mike who then introduced me to, in the end, seven other investors. And many of them, you guys will know, Audrey McClain, who just here, Steve Blank, Ron Conway, who's invested in Google and PayPal, Julie Constantine, and the list goes on and on. So, I had the privilege of meeting these people, explaining the product they all love what they saw, and they saw the potential on it. And then we closed that out in April and had a small war chest to go after, building out the company. So, one question that the investors most surely asked you is, how is experienced project going to make money? So, what's the business model behind the company? Right. So, it's one thing to be a visionary and be really passionate about improving people's lives, which is what we do with our product, but you also have to obviously gird it with the fact that can this product make money in a sort of exponential fashion. So, the business model for experienced project is not just eyeball as necessarily. It's an interesting demographic. It's 75% female in the site, and it's about a million people a month. So, it's a significant audience. You got a branding opportunity there. Beyond that, what becomes more interesting is the fact that the site is all based around experiences. So, we have a depression group, we have a water scheme group, we have one cancer group, and these are things where social proof doesn't help. On Facebook, for example, a month ago, everybody was joining the Freemianmar group, because there's social pressures that join these groups. Did everyone really want to freemianmar? No, they're actually going to do something about it? Probably not, right? But on our site, it's all about, well, you're anonymous, and there's no benefit to signing up for things you don't believe in. So, you're actually reaching a genuinely interested group of people within each one of these experiences, and often, many of them, particularly from the pharmaceutical side, are highly monetizable. And then you extend it one more layer beyond that, right? We know multiple experiences about our users. So, if you are a smoking cessation clinic and you want to reach 30 to 40-year-old women who live in San Francisco, who have perhaps one serious illness and smoke, or we can give you that set of people, we sort of have infinite number of focus groups. And funny enough, we just constantly get harassed by casting agents and by writers and people looking for, you know, like last week, we just placed someone in Prevention Magazine for a 40-year-old woman who was, you know, dieting with a diet buddy and had lost more than 40 pounds in the last year, and we were like, here's your person. So, we are really good at that. And, you know, Google's built an entire trillion-dollar business off of the fact that when people see advertising this relevant to them, it's okay. It's not going to be offensive. And we've always been very, very cognizant in fact, not making it creepy and not overextending our boundaries. So, once you actually are running the company now, there's obviously no playbook about this stuff. You know, how do you find out, what are you supposed to do? How are you going to be successful? Who do you talk to? Who do you get advice from? So, Stanford is a huge help. I could say, I mean, I could just really brave about this university until the Cowscom home. The fact that I was in the Mayfield Falls program helped a lot because, well, I had many mentors. And the word mentor, which is keep you coming up as well. I was assigned to a mentor, a client or Perkins, by the name of Tetchline, a partner. And when I was working with him, that summer, he let me sit in on a client or pitch. And that was phenomenally powerful when I went in for my first pitch, because I knew exactly what to expect from a top tier firm. But beyond that, you know, Tom's class, Tommy had to do the case study method and basically face adversity. He mentioned a lot of scarring things that could happen in GEM. And Tom Matino, with Mayfield training us and introducing us to people, you get that sense. You get the grounding, you have the credibility of Stanford. But then beyond that, you really need to work with people that have been there and done that. It's what experienced project is about the woman that's helped me a lot is actually standing in the back for a Mandalwam, who is a mentor capitalist, which sounds like a cheesy word, but actually means everything that it implies to mean. Someone that's been there, an entrepreneur that's faced these same struggles. It's an emotional roller coaster. Little every day, you think you're on the top of the world and the next day you think you're going to go bankrupt. And so you need someone that can actually just say it's going to be all right, zoom out for a second, you know, we'll get through this meeting, you know, get your next set of things going. These are things you should be worrying about. So I think it all comes back down to using the networks that you've got, you know, we're all very, very privileged to be here. And the people in this room have insane amounts of ability to help you and desire to help you to get attached to the people that can guide you and mentor, mentor, mentor. I can get you through some of this and lead you down to the path. You really don't know what you don't know. And it sounds tripe, but it's very true. One of the things that also struck me about Experience Project the first time I went on the site, which is how positive and supportive everyone was, which is very different than a lot of these online communities and forums that I had seen before. And I'm curious, kind of from the community building standpoint, if you think about how to grow a community from one person to 100 people to 10,000 to a million people, how do you grow that community and maintain that culture that's so important? So, critically important question. I think my background working with a health site had taught me very well that, you know, when you're the custodian of people's vulnerabilities, you have to take that very, very seriously. And you have to approach that from the perspective of this person is not just a CPM or a cost per action, but this is a person who's coming to a site because they have a need. And so I've been very cognizant of that in design of the site. And then beyond that, I consulted with more people that knew what they were doing, right? So one of the, my favorite conversations ever was with Catherine Affaick, who started Flickr. And I just sat down with her one afternoon and three hours and 20 pages of notes later. I mean, she taught me many of the things that had made Flickr the success it was, right? It's very easy for a picture posting site to turn into pornography center, right? And they did a very good job of making sure that it didn't go that way. And really the gist of what she said, no, she doesn't mind me paraphrasing her, but really it's for the community builders to spend a hell of a lot of time on the site and instill that community at the very early stages. So the first 10,000, 50,000, 100,000 users, you have to be there all the time interacting with them. And I still do all the customer service, sort of like in the create new mark model, because it keeps me very close with the community. It's not very scalable, as you know. But it does let you interact and set the tone. And then after that, you can start building some tools that help the community police things. Again, Craigslist is a great example with the community flagging. Things don't stay up for more than five minutes that shouldn't be on Craigslist. The same thing with our site. And then so you have us, you have the community flagging. And then after that, you still have to go one layer further. And we have bots that just kind of troll the site, look for certain keywords. And people I'll tell you get very creative with how they spell things and try and get around these bots if you grab the patterns. But you can still find content that is inappropriate with those three layers. And really it comes down to the culture of the site that's set at the very beginning, I think, by the owners. You talked a bit about how in the beginning the importance of building out the team and having the right people around you, not only to gain credibility with investors, but also I guess for your own well-being and the success of the company. How did you approach hiring? How did you pick people? What advice do you have for the group on that? Yeah. So hiring obviously is a hugely important thing for a startup. You're really marrying the people that you hire. And it's really the way it works out. You spend way more time with them than anyone else. You start their face for 20 hours a day. And you expect them to be able to jump in and fill in the gaps, right? So Neil and I ended up building a lot of furniture together in the early days, finding an office, setting up the health plan. Like there's a lot of stuff that goes into building a site and a company irrespectively and actually your product. So going with friends in the very beginning can be a very powerful thing because you can trust them. You can open up to them. You can say, you know, this is actually really hard, but I'm going through. You don't have to put on a happy face. Not everyone has that privilege. So I think when you're building out, particularly at internet type site, finding the person that has a combination of both computer skills as well as marketing skills to that BSCS, MSMSNE degree is actually incredibly valuable because there's someone who can actually help build something and then actually see the big picture while they're building it, doesn't need handholding. There's no time for handholding in the startup. So sort of who you look for and then how you find them, your investors will not help you find these people. Investors are really, really good at finding VPs and CXOs, but they're not going to help you find a great developer. So you end up just talking to as many networks as you can, developers are in high demand. And so your networks, I met you through Ferd Vendable. Again, through the mentors who know people, young up and coming people, Tina, Tom, see some of the best of the brightest, right? Those are people to talk to as well. Do not use Craigslist. You end up finding the weirdos of the world, which we did. So yeah, and really it's going to be through your networks initially because you do have to have that full faith. There are recruiters just as an aside, if you are looking for developers, there are definitely recruiters that find PHP developers or Ruby on Rails developers. And I was surprised to find that I thought recruiters were really exclusively for executive class, but it is so hard to find developers you can actually go through a recruiter, and that's much better than monster Craigslist or posting to the alumni list. Like the fact that you mentioned the Craigslist example, I think we run into a bunch of funny situations with that. Someone actually at once told me that if you're hiring someone that's looking for a job, they're probably not the best person to hire for that job because everyone that's really qualified or as a great employee is probably already employed. So you really want to be employing people that kind of are already have a job and kind of take them away from that job and join your team, but that's kind of my little aside. I'd love to hear also just some of the big challenges surprises you had as you were starting the company and also any advice that you have for those out here in the group and out in podcast land that might be looking to one day be where you are. So I think in terms of surprise and challenges, this is a joke that runs around the Mayfield Fellows Group, which is, you know, it is an entire program dedicated to entrepreneurs, very few of them, if ever, any start companies because they realize how hard it is. So starting company will take it out of you. I mean, again, it goes back to that passion thing. If you don't have the passion for your product and believe in it, you are eventually just going to get exhausted and spend your wheels and get tired and give up because every single day, people are going to be questioning what you do, right? People are very supportive in Silicon Valley. If you leave Silicon Valley and you go to, for example, LA, I'm from LA, every time I bring up the topic, you know, someone wants to be smart and come up with, oh, well, is it going to work in this way? Is it going to work in that way? You're constantly facing that barrage. So if you don't really have a debt-deep passion, I think you might be in a little bit of trouble. We talked a little bit about fundraising. It takes a lot longer than you think, no matter how hot you are. So you always have to count for that when, you know, you're basically seeing what money you have left. And beyond that, I think I have a bunch of tips that I would, I've actually took some cheat sheets on because I think it's a really important type of question. When you are raising money, you spend what you raise, right? So you really shouldn't raise a gargantuan amount of money because it didn't end up getting like the color copier instead of black and white copier. I mean, you will find ways to spend it very quickly and your expectations will be that much higher. There's also a flip side to that, which I think is something that was surprising to me when you're valuing a company, right? It always sounds great in tech crunch and, oh, I'm in all this, when you hear about companies that have these enormous valuations attached to them and everyone just scratches their head and goes, why the hell is that company worth $100 billion? And it sounds like it's a success, but then you also have to think on the other side. Like, does that just now limit their exit options, right? Does that limit their next round of funding? So Facebook is now $15 billion dollar company. They must go public or their employees will never be able to cash out, right? So hopefully they'll be able to do that. But as an extreme example, other companies that you see raising $10, $15, $20 million in their seed round or having valuations of that, they're going to constantly have to increase that and that just limits with a hundred X return that a VC expects how they're going to be exiting. So that's something keep in mind that's been surprising to me. Another thing to notice is that you think you're the center of the world because you're just focused on everything that you're working on, but you're part of a very large flow, right? So like I mentioned a little bit before, when you go into CNangel investor or VC, you're definitely not the only person they saw that day and that seems obvious, but also what's not necessarily obvious is there's relationships that exist beyond you and after you, where for example certain angels feed companies to certain VCs. And you might be seeing simply because you're part of that flow and they want to see the company after you. So you need to keep that in mind as that goes forward. It's not something that's immediately apparent, is that you're one of many, many, many and there's a lot of pre-existing relationships that you're walking into, particularly as a first-time entrepreneur without that savvy. And then I'll give you yet another one which is the value of an established entrepreneur. You've heard this a million times in your classes about how the team is important to the VCs. Again, someone who's actually been there from inception all the way to exit is worth an infinite amount of not just money, but you know affection because they can be there and guide you and have been there once before and again it doesn't almost matter what kind of company they did, but that's just infinitely, infinitely valuable. So just one final question we definitely want to get to Q&A and hear some of your questions. There's a lot of people in the audience here that want to start a company either right after graduating or a little bit further down the line. What advice do you have for students that are sitting in the audience and are looking to start a company? When's the right time to do that? How do they do that? Yeah. So that's the eternal question. So my personal perspective is that the path I followed actually worked out really well. I took a job at a company where I was paired up with a lot of people who were much older than me, had been through many different cycles before. It was more of an established company, had actually gone public and you get to learn by watching and interacting with them what the right way of management is, what are the pitfalls that they've avoided in the past. I mean that knowledge, learning it on the fly and learning it by fire is great and it works for example for Mark Zuckerberg, but not necessarily everyone has, I think that gift. And I don't think that you can underestimate the value of having some experience in the corporate world with people and again in terms of the connections that opens up and the strength you gain in your own ability to make decisions. That being said, I think there is a sweet spot in terms of forming a company right because if I haven't stressed it enough it takes it all out of you. So the more attachments and the more responsibilities you have in your life, obviously the harder it gets to take that leap of faith because now you're pulling other people with you. So had I been married, had I had a mortgage, had I had an expensive car, whatever, it would be that much harder for someone to just say I'm going to forsake that paycheck, forsake that healthcare, etc. and go and now chase something that not only maybe they can make up the gap for that salary, etc. but psychologically you're now going to form another relationship with something that's going to always be with you. And so there is a time in your life that I think it's worth, it's easiest to take that gamble. I know tons of people that have taken this gamble in the 35, 40, 45 range and done phenomenally well because they have ways of overcoming that. I perhaps overcompensate by just working more hours versus someone who might be more efficient because they've done it before. But I do think there's a bit of a sweet spot to consider. But I don't think necessarily rushing out of college and starting a company is the best path because you'll have more and more questions, you'll have more inefficiency. But really what it will boil down to, are you passionate about something enough to dedicate the next three years your life seven days a week to and constantly go to war for it. Thanks, Armin. So I think we're going to open up to questions now. Also if time runs out and you guys want to talk to us later we're both happy to stick around or feel free to shoot us an email. We're happy to talk about anything you want. So any questions, I'll just repeat the questions for the mics. Yep. What a question about when you said it was just you and Latfa a bit of time and you're getting some feedback. How did you balance getting feedback with any peers or giving away your idea and is you selectively think certain people have some ideas on over how do you handle that? So the question was kind of when you were by yourself and you wanted to get feedback but at the same time could be a little nervous about giving your idea away how did you balance that between getting feedback and making sure your idea was safe. I think that's a great question and you'll face that. The idea of going stealth unless you have a patentable idea, I don't think stealth really works. If you have a web idea or social idea the most important thing to do is get it out there and get people using it fast and first. Okay because you're going to find out a lot from all the people using it how to make it better as opposed to disappearing for a year and an island somewhere and coming back with a product that nobody wants or the wrong audience wants perhaps in a way you intended. So what I ended up doing the strategy I followed I was a compartmentalized different sections of what became experience project. So the island of themselves no one featured gave away the whole power of the side or the vision but I would build that out and then I would buy traffic just to that section and you could do if you're looking for something very targeted you can go ahead and use Google ads to get that for 10-20 bucks get 50 people to the site using it you don't need large numbers get that feedback and then roll it back into the main site so this is various strategies that you can do and also just from the perspective of search marketing etc. Getting the site up and out there earlier is better so I say don't be as afraid of someone ripping the idea off in the end it's execution and it's product quality it's going to make the difference and that's worth it. Back. So what's next for you and what's the plan for EP for experience project? The question is what's next for Arm and also what's the plan going forward for experience project? So we're scaling up rapidly now we're a team of six we have an office in downtown and we've established ourselves for that first year we've got tons of people using the site the next step that we're going to take is the entire site right now is user generated content which is really really great and we're proud of how it's come together but there is a need for people to see more editorialized content so Julio actually has been working on a lot of these things himself these agreements with people that have wonderful things to say they may be luminaries in their field and may be authors but also balancing essentially the user generated the UGC content along with editorialized content we are very very low to call anyone an expert on our site because well what's the right diet what's the right way of dealing with depression there is no one right way but it is great to see different opinions of people who have degrees and who have the experience in the books to garner some attention and people love seeing essentially some digest easily digestible data so we're moving it towards that direction in this next phase yep good question how many numbers do you have and what's your plan of monetizing these peer-to-peer or peer-to-peer right-minute app advertising? Yeah so we don't give away our exact member number and so we reach about a million people a month so if that gives you a little bit of a context and then in terms of monetizing peer-to-peer I'm not quite sure your peer recommended ads? Oh peer recommended ads no we actually we're not taking that model we were basically trying to utilize the fact that we can hyper target people from that perspective as opposed to recommendations on the site so this is an interesting model to explore and I think Facebook will pioneer a lot of it with their social ads as it goes on and we'll definitely be watching them but our model in the near term is to allow ad publishers to go ahead and figure group with people to target and do it that way. So on the two-year by yourself a lot on thing what made you decide not to bring in money or focus on someone else? Yeah that's an excellent question glad you asked that so it's a huge struggle right whether you're gonna build a team out very early on if not or not there's issues yes with equity and so forth but that's not the really interesting thing for me I actually come from a very conservative family and like I wanted to prove out things so as much as I'm an entrepreneur I'm risky I still have this constant nag in back that I've got to be sure got to be sure you can never be completely sure but for me I didn't want to involve any of my friends on this crazy endeavor until I figured out are people gonna use it or people gonna like it or people gonna form strong friendships on the site is it gonna provide the value that I think it will is gonna create the business opportunity so I had to take it to that point where I felt comfortable off with that leap when I saw the feedback essentially is after that publication the CNIP publication where I saw that those things yes they would work out they all weren't perfect on day one but I definitely saw the path to making them near perfect and it was at that point where I was able to involve particularly good friends on something because you are really uprooting their life you know they should be excited they'll jump in and they did to their credit but you do have to consider that other people's lives are now becoming intertwined with your own yep can you discuss the privacy issues that you've seen with your targeting and how transparent you've been with your users so the question was around privacy issues and hyper targeting and how transparent we've been with the users yeah so obviously very huge concern and any sort of site that deals with anything help related we begin to mitigate the issue from the beginning because we try not to get personal information from people that would identify them uniquely we do ask for an email address we encourage people to use free email addresses right we don't want to know what town you live in your zip code so one layer of separation there and then as time goes on we don't export our data out right so we're not interested in us doing capturing all this and sending it to another publisher and on the site we do want to start with the model where you just target people based on a particular group that they've expressed an interest in right so if they've gone on the site they've seeked out the fact that they you know are having a difficult marriage you know seeing an ad there will not be a transgression of their privacy particularly if it's relevant it might even be accepted as a good thing so I don't know if that answers your question completely basically I guess yeah have you seen any issues I know it's a huge deal right now because you do not track list right it's been out there and any issues with your users actually discussing that with you and saying we don't want to be tried sure so in terms of trying out there's different technical ways of approaching that right so we don't cookie them and follow them across the rest of the internet so that's one step so it's sort of when they come to experience project that is the limit of their interaction about these items we have not seen any sort of community of revolts or worries about the privacy issues except for the fact that the robot spider things right so to their having concerns that have come up every now and then about well my stuff could show up on Google or what happened then if someone searches for it and finds it and what we find is well most cases personally identifying data that would bring this back to you specifically doesn't that anything to a story naming someone's name or a city or whatever have you so usually with simple intervention there we tell people how to keep their stories anonymous and how to prevent revealing exactly who they are we've been able to mitigate that problem further right here at the front you mentioned finding somebody a specific age or any specific city in a category you put an ad in general category and you said that you're asking for that city in that age right how did you you mentioned finding some new various specific so you want to repeat yeah you had mentioned before finding a very specific person someone a certain age range in a city in a certain category question was how did you find that person to put an ad on a paper or how how does that work and how do you protect their privacy right so essentially the targeting happens and that we can do filtering on the site with the various experiences that people have said and we figure out who that group of people is we can then message them on the site we don't transgress into their personal email or whatever and we present them with an opportunity right which is okay for example this prevention writer is creating a story about xy or z would you be interested in participating at that point we then act if they're interested and they oftentimes are very very interested we then act as a middleman until we're comfortable and so we don't reveal their personal data to the other side until this person fully understands what they'd be doing and then we never link their username on the site with their personal data that we pass on to the reporter so we're trying to do a double blend wall to you so arm in yes what keeps you awake at night what's the biggest challenge going forward uh so I think the biggest challenge uh you want to see I just asked what's the biggest challenge will keep you up oh it keeps you awake at night yeah I keep cutting Julia off he's trying to make sure this stuff gets recorded so I keep you awake at night three hours that I sleep uh it's it's not a worry about competition it's a worry about making sure people find out about our site we get literally hundreds of love letters a day from the people using our site and Julia was seeing the entire team season all the time I forward them on like a little kid um they're just gushing love letters because the site improves people's lives finding out that you're not alone finding another person that gets what you're going through isn't incredibly empowering thing and it can change lives and in some cases it can save lives we were in last uh last month's cover story of Forbes because one of the women on the site credited us with saving her life um so what keeps me awake is the idea of how do you get the word out about this site how do you make sure people find out about it how do you make sure the culture continues to stay the same and very healthy and supportive sort of Oprah not Jerry Springer um it's very important to us um and you know building traffic and building awareness is it is a very very complicated task right we don't have the viral aspects going for us that my space does where you just invite 500 new your friends because you want to up your friend count and be popular uh that doesn't necessarily work on our site you know we talk about the things that you wouldn't necessarily express on a my space or Facebook along with the rest of your uh personality so for me i'm just constantly trying to figure out ways to get the word out um and in the right way right you know i want to just blast out you could give away a card tomorrow and sign up a million people that might not really be uh the right audience for you might actually destroy your community so we have careful measured growth on this site you know with with it it's a very strong community meeting so again don't bring in a million people overnight that i have nothing to do with it but you still got to grow uh in order to make your advertising model interesting and create enough liquidity in that market and so forth so i would say that that's the biggest thing is just how do you get the word out so it seems like all entrepreneurs have this type of mindset how did you develop it so my question was it seems like all entrepreneurs have this type of mindset how to develop this through college and what exactly my mindset like thank you i might turn red um so no i don't know i i would say i think Jeff Bezos says it really well you know you're an entrepreneur when you're taking a shower in the morning you're thinking about how to improve the shower head and how to make a water come up right so i think that might be sort of a natural inclination to want to improve things and so i built this ms site that was just really great right and i might have been content with that because i had a great life going and everything was fine but i kind of wanted more i saw a different way to help people um and i think in the end entrepreneurs want to improve if you're never satisfied with the status quo that might be the very core trait of an entrepreneur and then you also have to be amazingly stubborn and tenacious to just keep pushing because as i said people are just going to keep trying to shoot you down for whatever reason they're going to try and do that um and you're just going to have to be stubborn and go through it and believe in what you're doing and obviously being intelligent enough to know the way you're you know spouting is actually sensible uh i can prove it but i think that might be the core thing so just one more clarification on that two years about the laptop was that before you put your job out question was uh the two years uh along with the laptop was that before after you quit your job spilled water on myself that was good uh no it was definitely after so i when i when i was working as shlon i was working on the ms site as sort of a hobby and i was a very limited site limited reach limited group of people and so that was something that i could manage on my own but when i started rolling with experienced project and after the first couple stages and i saw that this is going to be huge and it requires all your effort and you also see that the window is closing if you start working on something you see the opportunities there from the business side and from a user-based side you've got to throw your time into it so that's when you kind of make that decision cut the cord um and then continue on like i mentioned before i had the benefit of having some salary coming in because i was able to consult but that probably extended you know if i hadn't done that maybe i would have finished in a year in a quarter or something as opposed to two years i'm going to pre-content with the way things worked out Jeff so when the when you uh convinced your second business partner to join you how to persuade and to sort of stop what he was doing and work on this full time he's how they paid uh uh question was uh how do you how did you convince the kind of business partner of second persons to join on Neil to stop whatever he was doing and uh join the team smoking mirrors no i wish he was here to answer that himself um one is i'll speak for him he has to trust the person that's presenting this opportunity that and he knows maybe we've known each other since freshman year we lived just down the hall from each other in otaro um and so he knew that i wouldn't present this opportunity to him unless i was really really sure that this was going to go somewhere interesting also from perspective of a job i mean uh you know you had been working at Accenture he had worked at Microsoft he had seen some interesting corporate experiences this is a chance to really expand out um and i think that is very enticing for start early term started employees you're not going to make as much you know you're going to work a lot harder than you're taking a job at Google or um Microsoft but you're also going to take on a ton of responsibility and you wake up every day knowing that the successor failure of x-wire z project or company is really on your back right i think julio's probably a good person to answer that as well if you want to chat with him afterwards do you have any regrets or what are some lessons that you've happened to learn along the way and things that you would not do again but perhaps have gained positive knowledge from question was there any regrets anything that you would do the second time around or anything that you learned along your way um it's a great question i think the uh the regret i would have was trying to take so long by myself for so long because it's just an immense task load um we were just been talking about when do you bring on a friend it's sort of a counterbalance of how comfortable are you taking that risk with another person um i wish we had built out the team earlier because it's just infinitely helpful having brilliant people like julio and niel as part of my team that i can count on you know it gives you the chance to maybe go away for a saturday and not worry about the site um because somebody else is keeping an eye on it that kind of thing so i would say that that would be perhaps my biggest regret was not involving more people early on um yeah yeah so you think you brought on your friend without paying me without paying me that how many people did you bring on before you got that money when you did like how much money did you pay all right i'm not at liberator share all these details um well when you have no money to pay someone you use your equity right and your equity is worth something um what is worth is a long discussion especially for any sort of web property that has a revenue stream in the future uh it's really hard to put a valuation on it but there are again leading through your mentors talking to them figuring out what would someone with this experience but this run way of no cash payment what would they get and then you know you try and give maybe a little more than that actually um to balance out a little bit of the risk so you know and in terms of what you pay yourself if you're a first-time entrepreneur i can't answer this directly but if you pay if you're first-time entrepreneur one of the things you always want to do is prove yourself out before essentially accepting too much in terms of the way of payback so you pay yourself subsistence wage and that's actually not that much you can actually get by with quite quite a little money yeah um you've virtually mentioned a lot like uh what are you um marketing strategies in the beginning of the marketing strategy? the question was what were some of the marketing strategies you used at the beginning to grow the site um serve an eternal question we used the fact there's a lot of other large sites that you can parasite off of right so before the Facebook platform my space was very very open right you could just write anything you wanted to run on my run on my space um and so we did build widgets from my space very early on that tried to integrate some aspects of our site with them um and that brought a lot of pretty good traffic although younger traffic uh it doesn't again get the site stretching its legs a little bit trying to use search engine marketing um is not usually the best method for sort of a broad site and we took the hard tact first right we're not a health site we didn't pick like one particular vertical to go after which makes life much easier when you're launching it because you can describe it in one word you figure out where to advertise you know your keywords and we had this sort of broad we wanted everyone to be their whole selves so search engine marketing is almost excluded from that except for particular tiny bits of your site so really i would say it was trying to parasite off some of these larger sites that you could another thing that helped a lot was you know being on the front page of dig a couple of times i was really helpful from page of delicious was really helpful um stumble upon is a godsend for any new site i don't know if you guys use it but it's just cool sites and then people say this is a cool site brings more people to your site um and can start quite a bit of vortex so the sort of the social uh recommendation sites can really help out broadly interesting sites to be going with and that really helped us in the beginning and i would say stumble upon probably more than anyone else. I had a question on this a little bit earlier but can you be a little more specific on how uh like i don't want to say secretive but how carefully you are about telling your idea and they're really just telling people and like you tell that to we just tell the end of that couple friends yeah question which is a little more specificity around how secretive you were in the beginning who would you tell your idea to would you just tell to anyone or friends that's your capitals. Certainly among friends you need to tell them i mean like keeping secrets from your very close friends would drive you insane trying to tell your family they had no idea what you're doing right so for most people so don't worry about it with that um yeah i think my mom just a month ago said i finally know what you're doing um satisfying after three years so don't worry about that when you talk to the investment community that is a really relevant question so the wonderful thing about starting a company and working with angels angels are usually former entrepreneurs that really want to help young companies succeed okay so they know the risks the balances they're not as concerned with you know um vcs are generally bankers right so they know bottom line they know revenue etc um and angels are also more selective about building out their clientele so to speak. Reputations are very very critical they can't just be you know damned if you you know don't like me etc like they know that you're going to go talk to 20 of your other Stanford friends and tell them not to go to this angel if they screw you so talking to angels is actually somewhat of a safe thing to do if you pick them out um you're not going to talk to a ton of them they can't do as much damage they just don't talk to as many people as vcs they don't fund as many companies as the vcs does um and again they understand your predicament quite well talking to a vc is a totally different scenario when you're a seed stage company and you just don't have that much particularly if you're a first time entrepreneur um most vcs seem pretty legitimate some are sharks as they say right and there's entrepreneur and residents that randomly shows up at your meetings and you know what is that person's job it's to listen to cool ideas and eventually build them out inside the company so proceed with caution with vcs um they're not I've met honestly I'm very lucky I don't think I've met a bad vc um but I've definitely heard the horror stories um and also one thing that you learn very quickly most vcs will meet with you right it's not a big deal actually to get a vc meeting even at the top tier firms because it's an hour of their time to hear a really cool idea from someone who's either going to start this company or ten other companies in the future so they'll take a lot of your meetings you need to be very selective on that it's just a little bit of a rush when you're like oh my gosh you know a client or wants to meet with me you know you have to maybe stop for a second to say is this really something in their sweet spot am I realistically going to get funded by these guys or am I just going to go and educate someone about a really cool idea um and so you keep that in mind but I think starting with the angels is a bright step for a seed stage company and then after that you're strong enough you've got your backing you have people behind you we're walking into if you see isn't as risky as it was when you were tiny you can ask that right and then you know did something else for a while right right in between there can you tell me a little bit more about how you can connect with the effort to help you to go to the network and the prizes and how you initially formed more advisory relationships you left Stanford did something else for a little while somewhere in between you decided to start this company um question was really about how was your relationship with Stanford having been here help you form that network of advisors sure I'm at the UN here really has translations same language though we kind of ought to about that um so I think that's a that's a neat question uh I left I was still tied to Stanford would come back for a lot of entrepreneurship type events um and particularly Tina Ceeley is incredibly helpful and Tina actually introduced me to Furn um so when I had the idea and I was ready to sort of come out to the Stanford community with it I emailed Tina and she graciously met with me and then she introduced me to Furn which then led to so many other good things so it's basically keeping in touch with the professors that you really really respect and have the they themselves know everyone right um and don't fire your bullets if you don't have them right I mean wait until you have something interesting that they can actually help you with and if they do help you with you're not you know perhaps hurting their credibility kind of thing if it's too early stage but you have this community don't neglect it they really care about you and they really believe them what they're teaching with Tom and Tina really believe and seeing their students come out and become entrepreneurs and they're really willing to bend over backwards to make that happen you mentioned that your advisors are very helpful in keeping you grounded and helping you to see the big picture can you talk about how angels help you make your decisions and how involved in hands-on they get with your company right question was around how do how do the angels help you make your decisions and how involved with it with the company so angels bring a different skill set to the game they are not going to be as tactical like they're not going to tell you oh you should really pursue hiring this person versus that person they're much more okay this company is at this stage it's raised this much money this is your valuation your future potential is you know x-y or z you need to raise this much at this point these are people you need to start talking to right they're very helpful in sort of setting the timeline of your company and introducing it to your next round of funding that's their goal right just to get you basically established they could also introduce you to people that will fill in strategic gaps in your company so if you need someone to dive in and really be a chief marketing officer for a month or a couple weeks because that is a problem you're dealing with for example a positioning issue and you need someone really expert to come in your angels can say you know what I brought this person and he worked at my other companies and again why is it the angels is working with these people why is that important because the people they'll bring in understand or at least age companies right they understand the not only the renumeration but also the team that they're going to be dealing with and the psychology of it so they can help very very strategically from moving you forward and again those issues they might help with are going to be on the path towards getting you that next round of funding or selling your company or whatever have you in that sense because mostly financially running to you how did you decide how much money to raise from on your angel round so you as entrepreneur will probably underestimate how much you need to raise because you figure out well I've been doing this on ramen noodles for the last two years or whatever doesn't cost all that much money and your angels will actually help you push that number up and that happened in our case where I wanted to raise one number and they told me to raise a higher number because why they've done it before and they know how much money it takes how much your lawyers are going to take out of that first chunk of money you raise which is an enormous amount by the way so hard to write those checks and so I think you figure out one how big is your team have to be how much you're going to pay them what are your obvious I mean simple spreadsheet type things and then there's a buffer zone that you need to meet with someone that has started a company and has raised around a funding that knows what that margin is on top of that and then I would say even on top of that raise a tiny bit more because the fundraising process is so time consuming and it takes a person out of your company to basically go do it the next time you run out of money and so having the right amount of money can be a huge help whether you hit or miss in the field.
