 Who you are defines how you build. This is the Auditorial Thought Leaders Series. Brought to you by Stanford E Corner. Welcome YouTube communities and Stanford communities to the entrepreneurial Thought Leaders seminar. I am Ravi Balani, a lecturer in the Management Science and Engineering department at Stanford University and the director of Alchemist and Accelerator for Enterprise Startups. This is the kickoff for the new year for ETL and ETL is brought to you by STVP, the Entrepreneurship Center in Stanford School of Engineering and Basis, the Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students. I can think of no better guest to kick off a new start to a new year than Justin Khan. Justin has jumped head first into entrepreneurship without having a filter like few people I know. So when it comes to starting something new, we are blessed to have the master of starting bold endeavors, Justin Khan. Justin is a serial entrepreneur. A few people have experienced peaks as high as Justin has on the entrepreneurial journey and depths as low as Justin has. And few if anybody is as honest and unfiltered about the experience. If you don't follow Justin, I highly encourage you to follow him on a variety of different social media outlets. You will have a better and more interesting and informed life if you do. But let me give you the formal introduction for Justin. So Justin is a graduate from Yale where he studied physics and philosophy as an undergrad at Yale. Then at age 23, he started with fellow Yaleies Emmett Sheer, Michael Sybil and Kyle Voitt, Justin TV, which was famous for being one of the first and anchor lifecaster platforms where a lot was centered around Justin. And a lot of it was centered around Justin's 24 seven streaming of his life. Justin TV gave birth to two other successful startups, social cam and most famously Twitch. Twitch ended up getting acquired by Amazon for just shy of a billion dollars and is arguably today worth 15 billion dollars. Justin has gone on to be a serial entrepreneur and investor. He also famously started atrium, which was a legal tech firm that raised 75 million dollars, but ultimately shut down. He's also been a press and investor. He has funded companies like alto, cruise, bird, reddit and many, many others. And today he's the general partner of VC fund goat greatest of all time and the host of the quest podcast. So without further ado, please welcome Justin con to Stanford. Welcome. Thanks. Well, amazing intro. I'm glad we recorded that. I'm going to play it for myself every morning. It is really on it is really awesome to have you Justin and I know we're going to have a lot more stuff to cover than we're going to have time. So just thank you in advance. Just to start off, I want people to, you know, people know you as the co founder of Twitch and maybe infamously with atrium and also being a former partner at YC and other things. But just for the record, can you tell people how many startups have you founded? Would you consider yourself a co founder of in your life? And could you give the scorecard of if you had to break them down in terms of wins, draws and losses, what would that look like? That's a good question. I don't know. It's probably like. If you include the ones I'm working on now, maybe like eight or nine, which isn't good. You know, I think if you're a good entrepreneur, you probably stick to one thing that really works. There's a little bit of luck in that. So maybe like you start two companies want to really work. I think I've had a couple wins. You know, we had Justin TV, which are Twitch. We spun out that out of Justin TV. We had a couple of spin-offs, spun out this company called SocialCam, Autodesk, hard for $60 million. And then more recently, I incubated this company, Alta, that's doing really well. I got sort of my house. And so there's maybe like a couple of wins and then there's a lot of like, there were some like draws. I started this company called the exec that was like a, basically we end up selling it. And then the acquisition people made a little bit of money. Those are very successful. And then sort of another company, whether for a very first company, Kiko was like kind of a draw. We like end up selling it on eBay for some amount of money, which was okay. And then like numerous numerous losses and companies that just didn't work out. But do you really believe that you should have that it's not it's a it's a vice not a virtue having started all these companies because I think there's. And I want to ask you this sort of honestly because there's sort of two schools of thought one is, you know, you find something you love and you stick with that as your mission. And I think the other school of thought is more than entrepreneurship is about resilience and testing and trying and experimenting. And I think many would argue that you wouldn't have, you know, stumbled upon the altos and the twitches without having that appetite to be okay with failure and starting many companies. I'm curious what guidance you're going to give the next generation the emerging young 20 or 20 plus year olds about entrepreneurship. Do you think they should just find one thing and stick with it or do you would you espouse the path that you took. Yeah, I, I mean, I think it depends on the personality, right? Like it depends on the person for you know, I friends are much, much more successful than I am and started one company. So they like started every and B or coin base that they just was something that they really cared about. They take the right idea and like they scaled, you know, as the company scale, they also like kept learning and growing and scaling with the company. And my personality is more like, you know, I love the start and new ideas out of learning. And so entrepreneurship is kind of a vehicle for me to learn and grow. So I think, you know, my personality is suited to maybe explore many different things over time. And so, you know, it's, it's, I think economically it's probably like lower expected value, but it's just what I love to do. So here we are, you know, but isn't that the ultimate thing that it should be driven by who you are. Yeah, you are not, not yet, not right answer. Right. Right. There's not one right answer. I think I might have my share of success. So, you know, it's great. Like I think I've, I've just discovered the like version of entrepreneurship that works for me. Yes, but I don't think you should be self deprecating about it. I guess that's where the division is. I think you should embrace that. That's your virtue. But let's, let's dive into that. So I think a few people, I think one of the upsides of having done all these experiences is a lot of people will comment about what you need to succeed or what you need to avoid to fail. I know a very few people who've actually experienced it, who've experienced successes, you know, at the order of magnitude that you have and failures at the order of magnitude that you have as well. And so I'm curious if there's any durable lessons that you know for sure that are required now that that that you know of now having gone through the failures and the successes that are required for success. I'm sure there's a lot, but I'm curious if you could share at least the top most key durable takeaways that you've had from those experiences. Sure. Yeah. So, you know, I had this billion dollar outcome. Like you mentioned in the intro. I also had the you know, raised 75 million dollars for another company and completely failed. And we had a returning most of the capital investors, the mostly like we lost money. And so, you know, where the lessons like I think they're all the obvious ones that people probably heard a thousand times like you really have to focus on differentiated product. I think if you don't have product differentiation that you know that's a new and novel and useful product that's 10 times better than whatever else is out there. Like it's really hard to grow something in like hyper growth, you know, it all stems from product. And I think I tried to ignore that at various times. I didn't focus on it enough and those were like really the root causes of the failures. And just to I don't want to take away from the others others, but just to make that clear, you know, you have a differentiated product when it's a tonics. And you have product market fit you feel like you're rolling the bulls are downhill right most of the startup is like before you a product market fit you feel like you're rolling the bulls are pale you're begging people to use your product you're like, you know, begging people to try it and give it a chance and eventually if you discover something that's really useful and differentiated, then people start to come to you and you feel like you can't make it fast enough. You can't keep the servers up whatever, you know, that is for you. You know that you feel like you're rolling the bull are downhill you're just running after it and I think that's the difference. And you know, you can I think it's really easy and Silicon Valley to cargo coal all the things that successful founders do that aren't working on your product, you know, like, oh, I need to hire like executives or raise a lot of money. But those things are relevant, you know, the downstream from having a product that everybody wants right there, they're pretty much irrelevant and actually detrimental to you discovering product, you know, something that works. That has product market fit oftentimes if you know, but it's easy to get distracted by them and I have in my career, you know, so that that was one probably the most important lesson, you know. And are there any pitfalls? I mean, this is sort of the converse of the same question, but are there any pitfalls that you can advise founders to avoid now that you didn't appreciate before. Obviously, the one on product market fit differentiation as or it is key, but are there any other any other pitfalls? Yeah, so so for myself, you know, like another lesson learned or like necessary ingredient is like to work on things that you actually care about doing, right? Like not I think it in the past I've been at times like really mercenary like I was a good business idea, so I want to build it. Because I think it will be successful and make money whatever it is. And I think having really spending time to work on, you know, it's been a time to think about what do you like actually love to do and what do you care about? And finding things that, you know, a space that you could where you could work on something that you love to work on in some way, you know, it doesn't have to be in every way, right? But in some way, something that energizes you, that's what's going to keep you going when it doesn't when it's when it's hard and I think oftentimes, you know, no matter who you are and what kind of entrepreneur you are, what kind of background you. It's always going to be hard at times. And so, and just to, yeah, product, you know that company or market that are founder market that, you know, yeah, and I love, and just to dig in on that then. So let's go through, I would love to talk about founder company fit for Twitch and atrium and maybe alto. But when you were going into Justin TV, I guess, even the precursor to Twitch, what was did you have an in, well, first of all, did you have a vision when you started Justin TV, or was it there, I think there's also these two schools of thought one is is that you have the entrepreneur that has the bold vision. And then they manifest that through the art of entrepreneurship and then there's another which is that no entrepreneurship is really about the process. And the vision will just unfold and you just need to focus on design thinking iterations working with people that you love and let the future tell you what the future. I would say there's like two kinds of entrepreneurship like the where the first kind, you know, vision based, the second, which is like you are. You are that you're on customer right or you really deeply understand the customer, maybe you're not your own customer, but you probably worked with your customer or like are very close to somebody in your customer. That's how you know about the idea. And with Justin TV, that's a perfect example where you know it sounds surprising, but I actually was it was both of those things right like when we pitched that idea for Justin TV to PG, you know, Paul Graham in the very beginning was a founder of like combinator. We were saying, hey, there's this, you know, this could be a new form of entertainment on the internet and I think in a way we were right like people, you know, my core core, the core idea was like people want to follow people, this is 2006 before social media, right. Really happened. So so we were like people want to follow other people to interest in other people's lives. And I think that has been that's a core insight that's been born out actually. And we thought we said this is the vision of this is like it could be all these different types of people we didn't see this like social media at the time, but like where anyone could just sign up, but like we thought there would be hundreds of streams of different people where you could see live video their life right and people would want to watch that. So there was like a big vision around it and there's like a new form of reality TV. Obviously, like it didn't play out exactly the way we thought well actually I would say it actually did play out exactly what we thought like 15 years later, we're now like IRL streaming this huge on Twitch. And that is actually happening where you have hundreds of not thousands of people are streaming their lives in various ways on Twitch. So so there was that big vision, but then the second thing part of it was like it was also what I wanted to do right in and what I mean is like I was actually the customer I wanted to stream my own life because I wasn't very popular when I was a kid and I was always looking for the attention of other people. And as a way to like get their approval and so that was manifested as my I was a young adult and I was like okay, this is you know I want to create I thought like if I can just stream my life to you know that I'll be popular or something is like a subconscious process right so. I actually was my own customer right like I and we built that very first version of Justin TV which was like a live video and chat. And so with my own use in mind right like we were creating our own show and so actually it did it was you know both and I think that's why it was so successful in the beginning you know and so you had the vision and you had this intention to and was that your was was was the intention driven by economics. Yeah, I mean part of it was like yeah we want to start up and we thought it was a good way to make money but it was also like exploring on curiosity right but would you step okay. Oh sorry there's many motivations right like part of it was like yeah I mean I have my friends that read it like started company they got paid very quickly I was like go I want that I want that right so there was an economic motivator but there's also a there is like a curiosity right like I really love new ideas and like new technology ideas applications of technology on culture and. And so for me that was like a it was kind of a novel idea and it was exciting to perceive that. So you I'm going to come back to to twitch and Justin TV but I want to stay on this thread of vision and intent for those who don't know twitch got acquired for $970 million you are you know your bank account was not empty after that you are you know it was it probably had a couple more zeros then you were used to sing. And then you go and you decide to start atrium. Can we talk about vision and intent with atrium and and how that might have been different than Justin TV and twitch and if there are any takeaways from that did you have a vision going into atrium or was it more driven by an intention then the vision and was that intention and can you add color on on what was going into the process. Yeah there I mean there was a vision well I would say it was it started off as like a you know kind of like a business model innovation right and a business model innovation was like. You can create this new type of corporateized law firm where you know it's run more like a business right and it could be more efficient for the customers. And the you know the problem I would say where rented which I think is true actually like that's like a that is it I think that's like a reasonable angle of attack there's like the problem was I think in the execution and probably the founder market where you know I thought it was a really good business idea but I wasn't really our own customer and I mean I was kind of like in that I was a founder who wanted to like start a company that had legal spend but I didn't really care that much about solving that problem from a company. I was telling that problem from a product perspective and I think the problem with that is you know was it was consequently we didn't create sufficiently differentiate in a product that like representative product market fit so you know like I was able to scale a lot of organization infrastructure and fundraising and stuff like that but it really doesn't matter at the end of the day unless you have like a really substantially differentiated product. And what was the intention then so why I understand there is this vision of a new business model but why spend your precious few days on this earth after having made you know more money than the top half of the top half of the top half of the top half of the top one percent of people in the world what was the intention behind spending your time on something that you didn't necessarily care that much about. I think that for me you know I want to make a lot of money more and I wanted to be more successful because I like I it with there was a you know after we sold Twitch I was like okay now what like what's the point like it kind of got the you know caught the car dog chasing the car and I caught the car is like now what you know I didn't really have a perfect feel like a sense of purpose and so for me it's like falling back on what I know like I know about entrepreneurship like what sort of bigger company maybe the goal is like not to start a building. One billion dollar company it's the sort of 10 billion dollar company. Here's a vehicle by which I can start a 10 billion dollar company and so you know I seemed like a reasonable path to pursue at the time I just don't think it was like particularly a self aware of like a lower like insight you know there was a lot of wisdom in there. And was the goal to chase the the former high from Twitch to try to like to where the goal post just shifted and you just wanted to rechase that experience again. Yeah I think I in the past that like experience goal post shifting a lot right like I remember when we first started Justin TV you know which turn it to which I was sitting with my co founder and I was like hey you know we could make each make a million dollars in entrepreneurship like because our friends that right ahead sold right it for like 13 million bucks was going to make that they made like single digit millions. I was like we could make a million dollars each and that idea blew our minds right like we were like if we did that would be set and then obviously when we sold. Twitch it was like a lot more than that and so but then like by that time it was like oh now I have friends who are like starting at Dropbox or Airbnb or you know whatever so like there's a long way to go to the top you know it's easy to like no matter who you are there's always someone who's doing better than you or got more than you that's easy to look at them and be like oh I got you know I should be doing better. Human beings are very comparative you know creatures by nature. Yes but then have you do you have any takeaways now about where happiness resides in the entrepreneurship process because it seems like after Twitch you would have been the poster child of any aspiring entrepreneur who's trying to make money you made you know you didn't make a million dollars you made probably two orders of magnitude more than that and yet you still. Thought I need to go even you know I need to have 10 billion. And so in these processes when is it the most do you ever feel happy or fully content and say and say did where there's not this desire to even do more maybe that is tied with happiness during in that entrepreneurial journey and if so where is that and when is that. Well I think there's two answers one is is that you know there are like whatever you do whether it's entrepreneurship or anything else you know there are hopefully ways like the experiences that you have of life. Being in a flow state right something where you're like very present and you just are love what you're doing you know you have joy you find joy in what you're doing you can just be fully present with it so for me like there were moments of that in. You know building a product or programming right like things that I just like really love to do there are a lot of things that like I didn't have a flow state in like managing people are like worrying about the sales or you know whatever there's like tons of things but we're about fundraising stuff like that. So that was like well there were punctuated moments of happiness probably like you know varying degrees over time like depending on what always doing and what my responsibilities were on the entrepreneurial journey. So you know like I would encourage people I guess if they're like looking for what to do like you should think about like what is the thing that gives you joy to do every day that's what I think about every like now it's like what do I love to do every day. And what would I do if nobody paid me for it if nobody was watching it if it was just for my own edification right right and so you know that's why like making content on YouTube it's like I love storytelling so like making content for this YouTube channel like it's never going to be as big as like people are making like really compelling content it's just like a little niche around entrepreneurship but it's it gives me joy to do it so so. And you know I do it. And so are you past that feeling before so right now when you see the coin based founders and because everybody is like Justin Khan he's the man and then when you see whoever is you know that next goal post for you do you still have that feeling and if not can you explain where you're at right now in life and yeah so yeah so right so like yeah I don't I let it go right like I let go of my like comparison to like other entrepreneurs but it didn't happen because I made any more money over that anymore successful. Like I had like tons of comparison and like beating myself up over oh we should kept going with which or whatever whatever like it's worth more like I should start a new company like that was all happening even after we saw Twitter right and then you know what change was for me I like kind of woke up one day I like went through a series of life events where I realized like oh I am just I like this is like this is a treadmill that I had done a treadmill that can last forever and I'll always be satisfied and maybe happiness doesn't come from external things it comes from the internal right like even like in the past like I've achieved everything I've bought and then there's just been new goal posts and then like another treadmill of like another hamster wheel of like unhappiness or dissatisfaction I should say and maybe instead like I should focus on like how I can be satisfied every day and like what are the things that give me peace every day. So there's a lot of things like you know it sort of take you mean a gratitude general every day started exercising every day started meditating every day and basically reprogram my mind to be like like let go of a lot of these attachments to like other you know outside sources of reward or achievement. And and are there and so you do you find yourself then more in that flow state that you were talking about before where you are getting more joy now than you did in the past or was there another moment in the past where you felt it was the pinnacle of life pleasure. No, no, no, no, now is the pinnacle of life for sure like now is the pinnacle. Okay, like for me it's like yeah I'm more in the flow state and more doing the things that give me joy every day because I'm just choosing the activities that do that and the funny thing is like from the outside it looks like I'm pretty much doing the exact same thing. There's this concept my meditation teacher speaks about in Buddhism where like the final stage is like a wheel of like progression and then the final stage. The image that represented is represented is just like the shopkeeper in the town square or whatever and he's just living like a normal life is just super at peace like free of attachment right but he's like gone all the way around in like from the outside you never know. Yeah, and I feel like the thing is like people are like oh you just on YouTube on social media making content and like investing and starts and keeping starts like it's exactly the same thing you were doing. Three years ago five years ago 10 years ago whatever but the difference is like today I just do them from a place of joy where I'm like less concerned with like where I'm not concerned with like the outcome and it's more about like am I enjoying the process of this and I'm working with people I like am I working. Am I doing the things that I think are my talent instead of the things that I don't think are my talent you know I think I'm good at fundraising I think I'm good at like. Ideas I think I'm good at mentoring and coaching and like maybe I'm not as good at being the CEO of these companies or whatever and so. You know I just like focus on the thing that things that I love every to do every day and it happens to look like a lot of the things that I was doing before but just part of them the part that I love and not the part that I don't love. It's such a good lesson Justin and I so people are going to say of course you can say that Justin you made a hundred million dollars or whatever and now you have the luxury of you know doing what you love but I can't do that until I've had my first. Twitch exit my first Justin TV or social cam exit. What do you say to founders that say that. I mean if you like go to Silicon Valley I might get a job at Facebook or Google or whatever you have like more money than you actually need right because you you know you can eat out. You can go on vacation like those are the things that are like really you know kind of like the. Basic building blocks of like contentiveness right that you don't have to worry basically you have like financial security everything after that is just like. Your new ramping up your costs to whatever you know your lifestyle costs like whatever your your means is at the moment and. You know so like no matter where you're at you can make a hundred million dollars and be like oh I can't buy the private jet that my friend bought you know like. Because that's 30 million bucks or whatever right like so it just scales infinitely like your needs your potential like things that you think you need can just scale up infinitely. And so I guess the only way to be free of that is to this like for your mind of attachment. And while we're on this theme of understanding what gives you joy and energy and can we talk a bit about resilience so you know across these nine startups you've had one huge well to huge break out successes but. The majority were draws or fails and you've also had your own strife during all these moments as you're going through and and going through these journeys. Any lessons on staying resilient that you've learned that you want to pass on as durable lessons that you advise other founders to adopt. Yeah I mean there's okay so what's that probably talked about some of them right like I think a meditation is really important like being able to find ways to be present with your experience and not every sorry I had to be. Every day but like what I do is a relevant that's that's kind of like a relevant right to you the list or like you should just find what work for you. But how many minutes do you meditate a day just I feel like that's like kind of a red hairing right like like people are going to be like oh I need to do a judge I need to do more. I need to do more. If you say very enough minutes I need to do 15 or 20 minutes is just 25 minutes I need to do 30 minutes. Fair enough. That's not the point. Okay. The point is that like before I was very not able to sit with things that weren't going well like experiences that I were uncomfortable right so like could be physical discomfort but also like you know emotional discomfort including anxiety over what was going to happen with my starter so if I was feeling that way I would go and like have I would have to escape from that experience and I had many different mechanisms of escape right like one was like I would get go get super fucked up into rank a lot or another would be like I'd watch like a whole season of Netflix and one night or something just to keep my mind off of like ruminating. The power meditation or there's many other like modalities that you can use to become comfortable with these uncomfortable experiences is that it like helps you sit with it and you can be present with the experience of oh something's going badly but not have to escape from it at least that's what really helped me and when you feel that way then it's like what that you're not ignoring your problems anymore it's much easier to like actually take the challenges of life had on so I mean that was like you actually become more resilient right so that's one thing that really worked well for me. You know another kind of resilience you know like one of the things I've done for resilience I think you know like partnering with the right people I think is really important so like finding the right co-founders maybe mentors some extent like the people who are going to be around you to give you encouragement the right time I think is like you know is invaluable I would never have like gotten nearly as far as I could be. As far with any of my projects without like having the right people around me and so like finding those people where you share values. You have a line values and people you can really rely on that's like I think that's really critically important. Are there any unintuitive insights there because I think you also have tons of experience with having gone through so many different types of founding teams. Are there any unintuitive insights about when you know you have a co-founder that is a high affinity fit that you should say yes to. Yeah I think it's and first of all how sacred is it to have a co-founder in your opinion versus going in going in it solo. Well I mean lots of people go in it solo and arguably like some of those are the better companies but like I think in my opinion just knowing my personality having co-founders really important I like to be around people and work with other people and so. I think for you know the the insight there is like it's all about values more than anything else I think values alignment that's where you get into conflict is when you have values misalignment and values aren't necessarily like. There's one set of right ones right you know like I remember one of my co-founders and I like argue because he didn't believe in FaceTime at all and I believe a lot of FaceTime right and he was like more like I want to be efficient and you want to work when no one else is in the office and I was like no we got to leave have an example for employees or whatever. No one's right it's just a cause of conflict because like we just have different values right and so. I think values misalignment is like super important. If there's anything else that you're that you're that you were going to share you're welcome to on on resilience hacks but it sounds like it's it was meditation teams. Taking care of yourself is really important like so you know it's sorry sorry marathon sprint you know having spending the time to make sure to take care of yourself for the long term oftentimes it's easy as a founder say oh I'm going to do that I'm going to like sorry working out after we get to this milestone right like right now I don't have time after I go. Fun rays and like it's like I got to do 80 hours a week or so I don't have time to take care of myself or you know like I'll Like you can easily put off everything that you've needed want to do for yourself But like in order for it to be maximum sustainable right like you have to make sure that it's sustainable for you right like it and it has to be Like a sustainable lifestyle and I think that's really important and something else gets overlooked. Now I'm not saying like don't work hard because like I think a lot of people swing too far the other way like Like if you guys are you know this is a class of Stanford students right so like you don't have any skills yet right like you probably don't have that much money. So like the only thing you have right now is like your ability to work a shit on but has to be like sustainable right so you're going to be better off and sustaining that ability to work a lot if you you know take care of your mind take everybody etc. But you know I think many Stanford students and Yale students as well have gotten to this point because they're pretty good at numbing themselves to pain to endure you know to endure through long things is there is there a tactical way where you know for yourself or for others when you're not taking care of yourself and it's time to really step back Is there a whisper before it comes before it comes like it's just like how you feel every day right like I you know some days I don't feel that You know I'm like oh I feel like shit because I ate unhealthily or I didn't work out or whatever and just like getting yourself back on the literal treadmill sometimes right or like Peloton or whatever to go work out like go to sound like I know that signs of like I like I know what sets myself out to be productive right like it's like if I meditate if I exercise if I Go for a walk whatever then I'm like prime to like have productive time if I like don't take care of myself And I'm like not prime to have productive time But just even feeling a little bit off is a strong signal that's something where you should say Get me just like people should spend more time You know one thing I love about meditation I mean like you know people probably take this with a grain of salt or whatever because like it's kind of like sounds Blue blue but like the thing I like about meditation is that it helps you understand your own experience better Right to get in touch with your own experience whatever it is your experience is like you know I feel Withhargic today or I'm like excited or whatever you're an emotional experience your thoughts It's like just gives you more sensory clarity. I'm like what is going on inside of consciousness? And I think that is helpful to like Make changes right like you might Before like I went through life like very subconscious like for example When we work on Justin TV We'd have pizza for lunch every day. It's like very unhealthy and I would eat pizza for lunch like most of the days And I'd just take a nap in the afternoon on the like fall asleep and I thought I'm just a sleepy fucking guy You know like I'm just like a sleepy guy and I never really Correlated like oh like when I eat pizza like all this like a high fast carb meal or whatever I feel terrible afterwards and like I just am tired And like I you know that fastened capitalism and like you know High glycemic index foods don't do well for me. And so like I just like didn't realize that for a long long time And then when I became more conscious of my experience. I was like oh like Like if I you know there are things that I can do to like make myself feel better And prime myself for like more productive hours and you know, I mean that's not really the point Like it to be the most maximally productive, but like the downstream effect is yeah, it's more productive And so I don't know I just feel like Be more conscious about your experiences never bad And can I and because you've been so open about talking about your relationship with alcohol and other substances Can I just create space for that? I know you've already mentioned it a little bit but um You know there are some people that would say that having Ex there's a whole movement right now with biohacking where people are microdosing with hallucinogens and doing things that allows for mental plasticity Um, I'm curious about and I know you're a curious soul Which is why I'm at and an honest soul and so I'm curious about what is your relationship to External substances And what's your viewpoint now and how is that evolved or changed or anything that you want to share on that? Well, I mean, I think psychedelics are really interesting because they're a way to give yourself some real plasticity and Like break your context, right? But I think there's a little bit too much focus on like psychedelics specifically Like I think that I'm interested in like anything that like breaks my existing context to give myself like Fresh perspective and so you know, I it's like anything to do that like just taking a day and doing a meditation retreat or traveling or You know, I fast thing for extended periods of time or breath work. There's like Infinite modalities for like things I can break your context and like make you see things from a different angle And I I think those are all you know, very interesting psychedelics. I mean yes like I I'm a you know recommend them, I guess, but like I think that there's a little bit more like I'm I think there's like one tool and like an arsenal of things that you can do for yourself But to be clear with alcohol do you view that as a tool as well? I mean alcohol is a tool right? It's a tool like numbs things for you and it's just like an out of very good one That's not very good for you right like so I was using alcohol as a tool for a long time. It's like Kind of like ibuprofen or something but worse right like I'd be like oh, I have feel terrible about something Right like my startup or my relationship or whatever something so like what's the remedy? I'm gonna like go drink a lot and then I like not think about it right now And what was the moment that changed that when when did you come to the moment where you knew that I didn't need to do that anymore I mean a couple years ago. I mean, I just realized I had 10,000 hours in or probably tens of thousands of drinks And I realized like it's not doing anything for me. I just feel bad afterwards and You know, it's that I've kind of exhausted every possible angle of like trying to you know, fix things in my life without All and it's like it doesn't work and I You know, there's some like health consequences. You know, I wasn't like that bad off there, but like That's not you know, wake up feeling horrible and I occasionally do something incredibly dumb and like this is not Great lifestyle like I'm not a great person. I'm not the person. I want to be one drinking Thank you, Justin I'm gonna go to Q&A in about five minutes, but just one so gang if you have any other questions start posting them Justin one of the themes for Stanford this year is a focus on principle driven entrepreneurship And what we mean by principle driven entrepreneurship is having a value besides just making money to dictate the decisions on how you on on on building new ventures What's your view when it comes to principle driven entrepreneurship and how important is that to you? Yeah, I think I'm primarily interested in principle driven entrepreneurship now right like everything I'm working on because it's and it's It's like what are the things that give me joy that I'm excited about doing like I only want to do those things and so You know with all the startups that I'm creating now You know working on now. They're like connected to Something that I like care about in the world And so Justin just play devil's advocate. How do you reconcile that with you know many people would argue that twitch is As phenomenal as it is is also Responsible for a lot of mental unhealth because it's it's it's it's it's Twitch has created a very addictive platform For built on this monetization engine when you look at twitch do you feel do you well? If that's true and you can let me know if that's not true, but if that's true How do you perceive your relationship to twitch do you feel proud of it? Is it mixed? Any comments or I don't feel that way about twitch, you know like unlike Instagram or something like that or Facebook right which I think is Questionably good for the world, you know like I think twitch is is Fills a need and it allows people to connect with each other in a much more human way like it with twitch You're not like presenting you're just your best You know face right because it's like live and it's alive for hours and hours So like people are seeing you in like all different contexts And I think that it's like a lot more human and a lot more connected um So I and you know with twitch we've allowed all these people to You know were like have this as a career or where you know it's something like they were doing something that like they wanted to do much less before you know I remember one guy like Early on he was like working at McDonald's or Walmart actually any quit Walmart to like become a full-time twitch streamer And I was like that's amazing, right? So I I feel very proud of twitch What I will say is that I think that the first wave of entrepreneurship Of which I was a part of this like internet entrepreneurship was about Creating platforms and using technology to Create something that of value prime where most of the value accrue to the platform right so I think I have Facebook and Instagram are like the Ultimate examples of that but twitch is in that vein as well Like when we thought about like notifications and you know how to get people to stream more It was all like centered around how do we do that for our own sake, right? Like and incidentally like with twitch especially like we were trying to you know by empowering streamers We knew that was on our benefit right, but it was like at the end of they were powering streamers because it's ultimately to our benefit And I think there's an opportunity of entrepreneurship that's possible where now we use the same tricks and technology uh, you know technological devices to Empower people to like live their best lives and like to do something in service of the user And so I'm like very inspired by you know apps like headspace or calm things like that where um, you know where we can that are like much more at service of the of the end user And like you know, I sort of this app called kin habits, which is like a It's like a habit tracking app like a social habit tracking app Which is you know obviously have formation is something that's really important to me and With this like this app is like all you know that that's why I started as like I could build something where I applied the things I learned from building social apps right and social sites to like how people be the best version of themselves You know be on the you know on their one asternity and so You know, I think that I see a lot of entrepreneurship in that direction and that's very encouraging It is it is um just I'm gonna go to the student questions now um the first question is there's uh an a question from an anonymous attendee Which is when is the right time to give up on a startup um, how do you know when it's not working the what what considering It's not working the way you want to when do you know to give up Yeah, I think you know people give up When they run out of ideas of what to do. I don't know if that's the right time or not But like that's what the practical you know the practical answer is like people give up when they run out of ideas and so um That's probably when you will give up Let me just ask you core. Yeah. Yeah. Oh no keep going keep going just no, I don't have it. That's my only Okay, well that is a good insight, but um, but just so with um You know twitch got born out of Justin TV When did you know that twitch was get what was the moment when you knew that twitch was gonna be big Yeah, so what we did which I think was pretty good was Internally people were not convinced which was ever going to be big Because it was like you know, there's 10 years ago Gaming streaming like is that gonna be a thing obviously gaming was really big on YouTube So there was like some hats hint to that but streaming. I don't know so Two of the co-founders of a company were like that's not gonna be a thing we should work on it and Em it was really when it was driving it internally and what he you know, what we did which I think was really smart was We agreed to set goals a priori so we were like okay if it grows x percent amount 15 percent a month for the first 12 months and 10 percent a month for the next 12 months and We think it's on track to be a really big thing, you know, because it was gonna be as big as game trailers.com Which is like the biggest video game video website at the time at 10 million m.a. You And so After six months we agreed to measure and we Measured and we had like well, we were measuring the whole time But we like saw that we had been beating those benchmarks every month and that gave us the confidence to say like oh, we should go all in on twitch Okay, and when was the moment that you knew that and and just to underscore that at that moment you guys it was it's easier It's easier to say yes to go on on to which then to say I'm gonna kill Justin TV Yeah, is that fair to say yeah, we had killed just Justin TV was like funding the whole Yeah, yeah, so we didn't kill it for until four years But I will say that's the easiest way to pivot is just to say yes to something instead of having to say no to something that you're Yeah, so I had this I had this call with my friend But you know, I was in person I with my friend with pivoting and start many times name was Matt Sanchez he started this company called same. Yeah And we were like how do you decide a pivot and he was like well, I you know Justin TV the business was right making like millions of dollars a year. We're like He was like well, I wouldn't kill that business. I would just work on this other thing Just have a team work on this other thing internally and then set these milestones You know, he's the one who gave us the idea for saying these milestones If you get the milestones then go you know work on this other thing and I think that's really what gave us a confidence to go for it Okay, and with Atrium when was the moment that you knew it was not gonna take off? Well, the problem was like it was kind of the same thing I ran out of ideas like that this it was I mean the tail yeah, we were generous. It was a pretty like we were generating revenue It was like generating like 15 million dollars a year revenue But the problems of margins were terrible on it and I was like there were everything we tried to do Improve it was like not working And then like the term was like it meant so it was like this is not a scalable venture business It's a business of some sort But it's just like not one that I would invest my own venture dollars in and so like then it didn't feel like You know, I felt like I was just kind of Making everyone do this Chinese fire drill but like you know until we ran out of money to like figure it out But like it wasn't working so it was like I don't and I didn't have any ideas on how to make it work anymore So at that point I was like we should we got a you know, we should do something different Okay The next question is how did you know it was the right time oh to sell twitch Oh, how did you know it was the right time to sell twitch? Do you regret selling twitch based on its current valuation people now say it's worth 15 billion or more What were your thoughts Justin on? Yeah, well, I made a YouTube video about it. You can go check that out on my YouTube channel but the you know when when I like I At the time like we had tried to sell some secondary shares for like $200 million valuation in January and so you know When we kind of went through this whole process of selling potentially to Google and then to amazon and We ended selling it for like nine or seven and then you know That seemed like an outrageous amount at the time compared to like what our internal valuation for was of course like turns out That was like a pretty good deal for them But at the end of the day like I have never regret about it, you know, it like the Journey that I've been on But the success and the failure I feel like I've gotten so much about it like from that those learnings personally that like I wouldn't have it any other way when like I said like You know even if you if you whether you have 10 million dollars 100 million dollars Even start lower whether you have 500 thousand dollars 10 million dollars 100 million dollars a billion the dollars like you can always have like You can always feel rich or you can always feel poor you feel content you can feel this content has nothing to do with the amount of money out of the bank There you go gang there you go. We're going to move to the next question, which is What are your thoughts on evidence based entrepreneurship versus intuitive entrepreneurship i.e Ideation execution based on customer discovery research iteration versus the oft romanticized knowing that your idea has potential even when others don't seem to agree Well, I think generally in the latter case when you know your idea has potential and other people don't agree Hopefully it's because you're your own customer right like but sometimes it's because you just believe in that idea so much But you're not really the customer and it's easy to confuse those two things So I would you know if you can't get anyone to agree that it's a good idea um Or or to try it like let's say you're like trying to build a prototype and you're like you know We'll try it then like and you can't find anyone that's probably not a good idea You know like even Justin tv which sounded like a horrible idea we got people to try it We got like people were like oh, this is cool like you know some like weird internet people you know internet weirdos would try it But like somebody wanted it and like Well, you know, maybe all the investors thought it was stupid which they did but like some set of people thought it was like a good idea Right and so You know if you can't you should be able to find some you know It could be very small set of people but you need to find some people who think it's a good idea I thought it was a good idea. Yeah And this story for the like class right like Robbie was the one who pushed Tim to make our you know That series a one investment which basically saved the company. You know we hadn't gotten that money from Tim we would have you know Tim Draper we wouldn't have gotten Our existing investors to come in with like a much bigger slug I think and and Kind of give them confidence so you are Indirectly responsible for twitch existing I think in some way I'm honored to be the catalyst. That was just the catalyst. But yeah, thank you Next question Justin is how would you say Justin.tv evolved to become twitch.tv and what was the process of changing feet? What was the process of changing features like Were you were there features that changed that you really had enjoyed or others that you were added that were added that you disagreed with I mean, I think the process like with Justin TV the problem was like we didn't talk to our customers very much and then Emmett was like hey, we need to talk to our customers. They're the streamers that people are creating content and We're gonna figure out what they want which was Kind of obvious and retrospect that we should do but like he was very innovative for us to do at the time Because before that we just built all the features that we thought we wanted and we were like not building anything that actually like anyone used And so with twitch like That was the that was the method and we just it was at first it was just a part of Justin tv's site It was just a gaming category, but we build like gaming specific features and You know like a lot of them internally were not with skepticism, but they Were important right like one of them was like having a partner program where we paid people for their streams At it totally were like what we weren't barely making money ourselves How can we afford to pay people any meaningful amount? It turns out like for a lot of these gaming streamers They didn't need to make that much for it to be meaningful at first And so you know By talking to our customers we really learned what they wanted and started building those things and you know Yeah, there was disagreement, but at the end of the day one of the things I think we did really well was let Emmett be the product person for twitch and he You know he figured it out and we kind of deferred to him Next question as you develop brainstorm new ideas How do you know if it's worth pursuing what do you do to determine if the product has product market fit? Well at the brainstorming side you probably don't know if it has product market fit or not So it's really just an idea right you really have to like have some version of the product out there to like really know if people really wanted right because people say That's a cool idea or they'll say like no I don't care But you don't really know until you like have it out there and so um I think that like you know for me. It's a lot of it is Exploring do I like this like what do we think about this idea talking it through with smart people? You know testing it talking to talking to potential customers and seeing what they say and then prototyping something and trying to get it out there and iterating you know in public So if it thanks Justin next question What is your advice for fostering and maintaining meaningful relationships? I so love that question. I love that question. So for me, you know, I spent my whole Life wanting like meaningful deep relationships with people, you know when I was a kid I felt like I was an outsider right and so as I'm adult I was like if I just become successful then it will attract people to me and To some extent that's true But you know, we mean that people want I don't want it to know me or talk to me like well I was you know after becoming successful you didn't invite me to speak it there, you know Technology entrepreneurship class or whatever But at the other end of it like, you know, they mostly want something from you right which is A little different of a relation it's not bad necessarily, but different And what I learned more recently is like, you know, in last couple years is like oh I could just have what I wanted which is the meaningful connections with people all along if I just I'm curious about people like I if I view people through the lens of curiosity If I just like talk to them about instead of just the world of ideas or what startups are investing in or building or whatever I'm just like curious about who they are as people and view them as someone I can work from and you know like I mean It's kind of a lame story, but I started doing that and then do my relationships got way better right like so I guess my advice for for that is is You know, it's all about It's all about developing and genuine curiosity for people around you And you know, what's interesting is you can learn something from anyone Like you you know, you from like the person who driving him around in Uber or like you know Your barista the coffee shop or whatever like there's something to learn from anybody if you just Listen, you know, and that's what I like ever since I started Adopting that attitude. I like feel like my relationships have become just much more meaningful the other thing I would say is I've like invested in just you know Thinking about who are the type of people I want to be more like you know and Surrounding myself with those kind of people, you know, everybody I want to spend time with is somebody where some part aspect of the behavior Something that I want to model in my own life And I feel like that has improved my relationship a lot And Justin you are intrinsically curious soul to begin with because I what I'm curious about isn't the is the other lesson Also that you've allowed yourself to lean into being who you really are and you know who you really are right now And you're allowing that out in an unfettered way Yeah, I think that's probably a good lesson Yeah, I think I've always done that in some way But I think I really have embraced it probably turn it up to you know the maximum level now Yeah, I mean again, I think Justin can be very cavalier But I think he's one of the most curious souls and real students of business that That I know and he does a real service even though It may be belied by all of his actions, but I think it's I think he's very curious I say that just because the lesson is to do what is you Justin is curious and he's and that's what I think what fuels him so But I don't want to interject Next question What do you think is the value for stem skills slash knowledge in starting up? What does someone with a non stem background need to keep in mind in terms of navigating a tech-centric startup landscape? Well, I mean like so obviously technology That like basically Tech is the innovation that's power a lot of like Silicon Valley startups right a lot of like the Silicon Valley ecosystem is like Connecting things with the internet and like you know enabling new business models by the internet and like websites and mobile apps and you know now crypto currencies or whatever right so you know That's like the obviously if you have the skills to build that stuff like that is kind of like a core foundational thing for any like technology product and Obviously there are other startups that have sat on top of uh innovations that have happened in technology like the whole D to C revolution and like all these people selling all birds or whatever That that's enabled because people have been able to market in a different way on the internet right through you know Facebook or whatever and So there's you know there's you don't have to necessarily have just a stem only You know, there's like lots of opportunities for entrepreneurship that don't involve like learning how to program Um, but if you do not program. It's like a very useful skill for you to you know Sort of company that's in the technology space Um, actually I think it's useful in general to like you know Even if you're starting company not in the technology space because it's it programming gives you a framework for how to get leverage on Your time right um by building programs and do stuff So You know, I think it's good you should learn it um If you don't but if you don't want to and you don't where you don't it can't You know, there's lots of other skills that are necessary and startups like I don't program things anymore like what I'm good at is I'm a great storyteller. I'm great at fundraising and recruiting and you know stuff like that Those are new things that are necessary and startups of like figure out what is a genuine thing that you are great at And you love to do and you know, there's probably a place for that and starts like I mean even art right like someone now like what everybody's making NFTs right like and there's always like NFT Communities that are basically startups from you know startup crypto projects and like that's Very fueled by the art out in it, right? So like there's something for everybody That's in the world of starts and technology We might have temporarily one more question and there's two that are tied so I'm going to exercise my prerogative I'll ask the other one if we have time to um, but the question is Do you think if you had started with your current self no compare that is no comparisons to others You would still get to where you are now isn't ambition and comparison the driver of success I think ambition and comparison is a driver of success Um, I also think curiosity and joy can be a driver right like I'm still doing things that I think are going to be successful and Probably economically successful. I hope Um, but I'm not doing them because I'm like oh, I'm gonna make as much money as X or I'm gonna like you know I've got to buy a buyer like how to feel this accomplished It's more like because it's curious You know, it's like I'm interested in seeing what the world like when these things exist And it's something that I like to work on it's and it's a creative pursuit for me. So um, I actually think I would have been more successful if I Had been more comfortable with myself and with what I was good at and not always reaching for something else And my direct example is with twitch You know, Emmett was running the product he was really the product visionary and really the driver behind twitch So like since for the last 10 years or whatever I'm just been credit for claiming Emmett's like success really Emmett gets all the credit You know, we had but but like At the end of like I end up starting another company and kind of moving to like just be on the board of twitch after a couple years And what I should have probably done from an EV perspective just like to maximize if I was interested in maximizing outcome was like I should have probably just stuck around And helped him raise money because I was really good at raising money and he was like hated it And Consequently because it was hard to raise money. That was one of the factors in selling So, you know, it could have been the case that like maybe I just let my ego go and I was like oh, you know It's okay if I'm not the CEO of this company. It's okay if I'm like have a job that's less important or seemingly less important Then my friend who's in my co-founder and I just like you know Work for whatever a month or two months or three months of your raised money and then like I don't know hang around the company or sit on the beach or anything And like that might have been like made me much more successful, you know at the end of the day But instead I was very ego driven. I was like oh, I got to like be the man. I'm I mean to be number one And so then I was like driven to do something that ultimately you know was not that successful But it's all good like that's a learning, you know The entrepreneurial thought leader series is a Stanford E-Corner original production The stories and lessons on Stanford E-Corner are designed to help you find the courage and clarity to see and seize opportunities Stanford E-Corner is led by the Stanford Technology Ventures program and Stanford's Department of Management Science and Engineering To learn more please visit us at ecorner.stanford.edu
