 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these elections online at eCorner.stanford.edu. On today's episode we have Carlos Watson, an entrepreneur and Emmy Award-winning journalist based in Silicon Valley. In 2013, Carlos co-founded Ozzy, an online magazine offering originally crafted news of the world. He previously anchored shows on CNN and MSNBC. He's also a graduate of Stanford Law School. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. What wonderful welcome. I'm super excited to be here. It was fun talking to Tom earlier and thinking back to, I know a number of you are undergrads and thinking back to being in the class of a guy named Martin Kilsen who was my favorite professor in college in cold weather, Cambridge, Massachusetts. And in many ways was the guy who encouraged me to go the entrepreneurial route. But I would love to share with you guys a little bit of what has taken me on this journey. Some of the things I've learned, good, bad and other. And some of the things I still wonder about because hopefully I've got a lot more ahead of me. And then at some point I'll stop and would love to get questions from those of you here. I often say I didn't start life off headed down entrepreneurial path. I probably was more likely to be a teacher. I like to joke that I'm related to more teachers than anyone you'll ever meet. Parents, siblings, aunts, uncles, grandparents. I come from a long line of teachers. And so that seemed much more likely. And in my family there was a very earnest hope that I would become a lawyer. I know you know in many families, lawyers and doctors, sometimes engineers are kind of particularly prized. And I think growing up, particularly for me in the 70s and 80s, there was a sense that lawyers often did really good things. Often were involved in important causes. It had been a meaningful part of the civil rights movement. Third good marshal who later became a Supreme Court justice. And so for my grandmother who was from Jackson, Mississippi, her most fervent hope was that her grandson, the one who used to break her chandeliers and cause trouble and make her wonder if she had one grandson too many, she always hoped that I would go on to become a lawyer. That was on the brain, leaving teaching behind and maybe going on the law school, it was on my mind. But my sophomore year I took a course by a wonderful guy named Martin Kielsen. And any of you by any chance have heard of Martin Kielsen? Any chance? Martin Kielsen was a wonderful professor at Harvard. I was an undergraduate. Now to look at him, you might confuse him with a homeless gentleman. You may not know any different. He used to have a little ragged hat that he would wear. And his clothes were always rumped and he couldn't seem to quite find his way. But I tell you what, Professor Kielsen was one of the most thoughtful, interesting eye-opening people I ever met. And as I took his course, which interestingly enough was not an entrepreneurial course, but was actually a course on politics back in the fall of 1989. Professor Kielsen challenged me in lots of other students, not just to think about law and politics, but to think about becoming entrepreneurs. And that doesn't seem very remarkable today. And that certainly probably doesn't sound very remarkable sitting here in Silicon Valley, saying that to you. But sitting in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1989 and having this rumpled professor say to a group of students, it included myself that as opposed to thinking about the politics that we were so focused on that maybe part of the good change in the world might come from entrepreneurs was really unusual. Entrepreneurialism wasn't as broad-based as sexy. There weren't incubators or an accelerators. And so it was the first time that someone had put that in my mind. With that in my mind, I decided I wanted to learn more about it. And Harvard really didn't have undergraduate courses. And so I started to wander around. And I went to the economics department and wanted to see if some of the professors there would offer some kind of independent study or course. They said, now we won't do that over here. And so they sent me over to the business school. They said, now we won't do that. Interesting enough, they sent me over to the Kennedy School of Government. They said, now we won't do that. They sent me back over to the business school. And as I was walking, dejected from the offices of a nice guy who was the dean, Bill Salman, who I don't know why he allowed this undergrad in his office. But I think he didn't know any better. I probably slipped in the door quickly. He finally said, well, I have one other idea. There was this lecturer here who normally teaches at Babson. His name is Jeff Timmans. He's an entrepreneur. And maybe you should go talk to him. And man, oh man, may he rest in peace. Jeff Timmans was an entrepreneur who had done really well with the beginning of cellular phones and also the cable industry who had decided to teach. And Professor Timmans said, why not? Why not? Do an independent study. He mainly talk courses at Harvard Business School. And he said, why not? Why not? Allow this undergrad to do an independent study with me to sit in all my classes, visit lots of interesting businesses. And so I began a little journey with Professor Timmans. He would have me go and meet with different small business people, a t-shirt maker, guy alone, a couple of pizza shops, someone who owned a radio station, and ask him about the good, the bad, the ugly when it came to entrepreneurship. And that really was the first thing that, again, kind of took Professor Kielsen's kind of a seat of an idea and took it further. And I think part of what I heard in the variety of people that I ended up talking to was that it wasn't easy. And that was probably the most obvious thing. Go forward a little bit. I graduated from college. I'm thinking, man, I would love to try something entrepreneurial. My dad, who as I told these to teacher, my mom was a teacher. He was not that excited about his boy with a Harvard degree going to do some kind of startup. That wasn't exactly on his list of plans. And I had this crazy idea that these things, anyone here ever eat buffalo wings? Before they were big, your friend said they were going to be big. And my dad was like, nah, that's a bad idea. Don't do that. No one's ever going to eat them. Why would anyone want them delivered? And I was like, Dad, I'm telling you, these things are great. You don't always want pizza. These other things are good too. And low and behold, for better or for worse, he talked me out of it. It was a good lesson though. And it's a lesson probably a lot of entrepreneurs learn, which is that a lot of times you're wrong, but sometimes you're right. And sometimes when you're right, not everyone's going to be able to see it right away. And while you've got to be thoughtful enough to listen, you may not always follow even the advice of those closest to you, namely your dad, whose name you borrowed, because I'm Carlos Jr. So now we are five or six years into it. And I still haven't really stepped out and done the entrepreneurial thing. I do go to graduate school, here at Stanford and loved it. Love the son, love the people, love the openness. This was kind of the early 90s. And so while there still were memories and kind of legend and lore of Hewlett-Packard at the time and Steve Jobs and a handful of others, it wasn't as at least to my mind as robust an entrepreneurial environment as there is today. And it wasn't immediately obvious that those opportunities were out there. Not just for kind of entrepreneurial opportunities, but even I remember when one of my buddies who graduated in the mid-90s got a job in venture capital right out of business school that was considered quite unusual. So the environment in my mind wasn't as rich and as interesting. But I still, I had thoughts in my mind that I wanted to do something, but I took a safer out and decided to go work at McKinsey and Company. Any McKinsey or ex-McKinsey folks here? Okay, there's one. A couple good folks. And so that was a wonderful opportunity. It was unusual because I was coming from law school. So I wasn't part of the business school tribe, but I was one of the folks who came from science or medicine or one of the other places. In my case, it was law. And as I went into it, a good friend stopped me and she said, you have to promise me that you're not going to stay longer than two years. She said, I know you want to do something entrepreneurial. And I know if you get in there and you don't go in with the mindset that this is limited, you'll end up looking up and it'll be 10 years, 20 years later. And so that was another tick along. So I go into McKinsey and actually she helped me a lot and say that because I went into McKinsey not just wanting to do a good job in general because I'm my mother's son and that's what she wants you to do. But also because I started to think about it more practically. I started to think the better I was for my clients, maybe one day the better I would be in advising myself and my partners and my investors on how to make whatever I started grow. So again, slowly these things are building up in my head and I'm spending time at McKinsey. Wonderful opportunities, some here, some overseas. Finally in the later 90s I decided to go for it. And along with a good friend from college and one of my sisters I decided to start an education company called Achieva. And actually I take that back. It wasn't called Achieva. Originally it was called Sierra. It was called Sierra College Prep Services. And why Sierra? Sierra just sounded peaceful. Sounded like someone who could bring you joy. We ended up changing the name because it didn't make sense to anyone. But at least at the time we started. And as I, the way I ended up doing it, I spent a bunch of time thinking about it right in a business plan, putting all that together. And then with that I went to go talk to a guy who had kind of become one of my mentors. And he was a super wonderful guy named Mark Jones. Any of you heard of Ares, a wonderful internet of things company. If you don't know Ares, not only is he a wonderful company but it's run by one of the most wonderful people in the world, Mark Jones. I get teased all the time for saying everyone's nice but Mark is certifiably the nicest guy who's ever been created. But Mark, I want to go see Mark to tell him a little bit about this idea that I had for a college prep company. And Mark listened dutifully, asked a couple of tough penetrating questions. And then Mark went away. I was like where did he go? Because he kind of disappeared a little bit abruptly. And when he came back, he came back with a check. He came back with a check for $15,000. And I realized that to some of you that won't sound like very much. But for this kid from Miami back in 1996, that was a huge vote of confidence. And Mark came from kind of a similar family of teachers. And he said, I know how hard it is for someone like you to think about walking away from a McKenzie paycheck to start something. And if I can be a little bit of an encourager along the way, if I can be one of the people who pushes you further down the road, then I want to do it. So Mark handed over that check. He didn't say this was alone. He didn't say I want X, Y and Z for it. He said go forth and do the best you can. And so at that moment, I was committed. I was into it. The next call went to my favorite uncle. I have a wonderful uncle who looks just like my dad and has the ability to be more fun because he didn't have to put up with my problematic side. And I called my uncle Dunbar who had never gone to college. My uncle Dunbar passed up college so that his other two brothers, which included my dad, could go to college. He worked at the equivalent of, he worked at a big oil company for 40 years as a technician. And when I called Uncle Dunbar and told him what I was thinking about doing, he, and at the time, I just, I was not smart enough to really understand and appreciate what he did. But Uncle Dunbar had about $100,000 in his 401k and he wired the whole thing to me. And to my sister. And that was his whole savings. That was everything. And he wired it to me a couple days later. And so with that, my good friend and my sister and I thought we're on to something. We're about to win. This is going to be good. And we began what ended up becoming a five, five and a half year journey, which was neither as easy as maybe I would have thought. And not as straightforward. Lots of interesting surprises. But we ended up building a nice company, achieve a college prep services that help high school students prepare for college. So not just the SAT prep, but what college should I go to? Am I going to pay for it? What are these things called essays that they want? Who do you ask for a letter of recommendation? Offering all that kind of advice and a comprehensive way via software books and workshops, not just to individual families, ultimately to big school districts like Miami and Chicago, Detroit, and others. We ended up selling it years later to the Washington Post, which owns Kaplan and a bunch of other education companies as well. But it became a big part of my learning, a big part of my growth, a big part of kind of shaping who I was. And I'm going to come back to that in just a minute and hopefully tie a number of these things together. While at achieve, I was on TV a couple of times and talking about achievement and what we were doing. And so I ran a call from a guy named Elliott one day who said, in effect, he left a voice me on, he said, I saw you on TV, wondered if you'd ever think about doing more of that. I'm in charge of what they call development, would you consider talking to us? Well, I didn't believe Elliott was really called a couple of times. And that's because I have a very good friend named Rachel. And what Rachel loves to do in this life, and Rachel, if you're watching, I'm talking about you, Rachel loved to play pranks on me. Back in the day, Rachel lived in LA and she would have people call me and say, is this Carlos? Yeah. Were you just at this party in Hollywood? Yeah. Look, we've got this new movie coming out. We need someone to star opposite Halle Berry. We think you'd be great. Do you want to have breakfast tomorrow? And of course, I was dumb enough to say, oh sure, of course you're calling me. Of course I'm ready to do this. And Rachel would call back a few minutes later. She said, hey, you want to have breakfast? I'm like, I can't have breakfast. I got some for it. She's like, why? Because you're talking to someone who sounded like this? And so I just assumed this guy, Elliot, was just another Rachel prank. I ended up talking to Rachel and it turns out that this time it's not her. And I got so upset with her. I said, see, you've caused so many problems over the years that I'm now looking at GeForce in the mouth. Luckily the guy called back ended up having an interesting conversation and I ended up a couple months maybe a year later beginning what became an interesting career in television. First starting out as a guest host. I don't know if you guys know it, but it turns out that there are groups of people who work for TV networks that are scouting for talent all the time and often look for people who've been guest appearances and think, could you do more? Could you do more as a talk show host? Could you do more as a regular host? What have you? And so I ended up spending much of the next several years in television at CNN, at MSNBC, doing various kinds of shows, often kind of interview shows and really, really enjoyed it. But a few years ago, sadly, while I was in the midst of that and living in New York, my mom got really sick and she was living here. And so after a little bit of back and forth, I left that and came to move out here to take care of her. And while I had never had anyone in my life who I was really close to, who had gotten that sick, she actually had a late-stage cancer. And so probably for the first time, I don't know if any of you are like this, but I definitely, for whatever reason assumed I was going to live a super long time. My mom's mom had lived to 102, both of her grandmother's had basically lived to 100. And we used to always joke that she was going to live to 125. I was going to get to a buck 50 and we all were going to go quite the distance. So I was, as was she, was obviously surprised when it turned out that she was sick. And so it really made me, and I realized it still sounded a little hokey, but it definitely made me rethink life a little bit. It definitely made me appreciate that it may not go as long as I expect that it could end sooner than I know. And so really kind of pushed me to ask what would I love to do? What would bring great joy? What might I be good at? And so began doing a fair amount of soul searching. And she was part of it. I was often driving her to doctor's appointments and starting to think and she would pepper me. And she was a teacher. She was a teacher, as I said, for kind of 40 plus years, teaching everything from kindergarten to college and she would pepper me with questions about what do you really want to do? What do you love? And I realized that there still for me was a hunger and a desire to do another startup. That as much as I had learned and enjoyed, and as hard as I'd worked and as many hours as I'd put in and as much weight as I'd gained, working seven days a week for a five and a half, six years straight, that I wanted in again. And I wanted in with something that I really cared a lot about, which for me, I had always I think in no small part because of my dad, I'd love the news. And I'd love figuring out what was going on. And it was less just an intellectual exercise of knowing kind of what's happening when. And more, my dad always introduced you to the news whether you were listening to it watching it, reading it as a way to kind of expand your sense of what you could do. And so when he would read something in the paper or hear something on the news, he would translate it to that conversation you were having with your buddy, Billy, or that school project you had or that thing you told him you wanted to do. And so I started to think about where the news was at that point, which was a couple of years ago. And I found that I in love it as much. I found that it would become a little predictable in a lot of cases. Meaning that whatever the handful of big stories were around the world would be the same story you'd see in most publications. And so even though I had more choices digitally in terms of where I'd get my news from than I did as a kid, I found that often they were repeating or emphasizing the same four or five stories. And so I started to think what would different look like? What would magical look like? And I started on a journey of talking to folks at Huff Poe and Vox and Buzzfeed and The New York Times and NPR and other places. But then in LaGuardia Airport, I bumped into a wonderful guy named David Neeleman. Any of you ever here of David Neeleman? Did he? David Neeleman, the founder of JetBlue. And also I guess a zool. Now any of you guys ever fly JetBlue back in the day? I love JetBlue when it first came out. And I remember meeting David Neeleman in the airport and saying to him, Mr. Neeleman, how did you make an airline that I have an emotional reaction to? That I actually love. That I kind of look forward to. I go out of my way to fly you guys. I'll change the time I'm going to fly. I'll change the location from which I'm flying. How did you do that? And he said, across I spent a lot of time studying the business. In fact, he'd started an airline before JetBlue that he'd sold to Southwest Airlines. He said, been in the air and I kind of trusted my gut and what I loved a little bit. So here was a guy who was kind of slightly tall, not super tall. Tired of having his knees banged and made sure that everyone had a little more room. And I can't remember how many kids he had, but he said, Carlos, you know what happens? Ten. He said, Carlos, you know what happens when you have that many kids? You know what you want more than anything else? I said, what? He said TV time. And so I don't know if you guys remember, but JetBlue was the first to put TVs on the back of everyone's thing. So I say that only to say that part of what David Nealum and did for me was say that as I started to think about trying to reimagine the news. As I started to say that as much as I loved the New York Times or NPR or USA Today or any of the other places I'd gone a lot to, if I really was going to think about trying to creatively reimagine it, it wouldn't just be doing a McKinsey competitor research review. That in part it would be kind of following my heart and asking myself and maybe others I trusted. What would you love? What would you like to do for a new, you break habits and start to try something new? And so as much research as we did, my partner, Samir and I, wonderful guy named Samir Rao, decided, okay, well let's stop and actually ask ourselves that question. What would it take for us to fall along with a new and different kind of news site? What would it take for someone to do what, and we were inspired a little bit off to tell you by Apple and HBO and Tesla? What would it take for us to reimagine a space that already seems plenty crowded? And I say that meaning that for those of you who don't remember, the computer space was pretty crowded when Steve Jobs returned to Apple in the late 90s. It wasn't immediately obvious that anyone needed a new and different computer company. And yet still with that little colorful iMac and a lot more, they managed to reimagine what was possible there. And for those of you who like me give credit to HBO for kind of kicking off this golden age of television. Many of you remember that when HBO finally started getting hot with Sex in the City and a bunch of others, it was not at a time where there were three or four TV channels already by then. I had dozens of choices. But HBO still kind of colorfully re-imagined what TV could be. And so in our mind we thought as crowded as this space may be, there may be a chance to kind of think about this whole thing differently. Four things stood out for us that we thought we had to do in order to become for our target audience, which we often call the change generation. Not the only place that they go for their news information, but we hope they're first in favour. Most of what we thought we have to do a good job of catching you up on the big stories of the day. Right? We got to do a quick, we got to do it fast, almost as though you were the president. And hence we created something called the presidential daily brief, which some of you may see when you look right here and hope some of you are readers of the presidential daily brief. But once we caught you up, we thought the second thing we could do, and maybe the more important thing we could do, is vault you ahead. Could we introduce you to the new and the next, whether that meant new people, new places, new trends, new ideas? Not a minute or an hour ahead, like might happen with Twitter, but could we introduce you to people in places and things three months, six months, 12 months before you normally might see it on CNN, or you might read about it in the times. And so, not LeBron James or Cheryl Sandberg, but maybe the next LeBron or the next Cheryl Sandberg. And we were inspired in part by Wired. Any of you remember Wired back in the day when Wired First got started? Any Wired fans early on? The Wired First got started. You would read stuff in Wired. I used to sit in Borders bookstore for anyone who remembers Borders bookstore on University Avenue. I used to sit in Borders bookstore and you would read stuff in Wired that you would only end up seeing in mainstream publications a year or two later. There are any music fans here. I would say that's what the source and pitchfork used to be, like a little bit, where they were clearly ahead of the curve. So that was the second big piece for us. Could we not only catch people up but vault them ahead? The third thing is we thought the design and style and flavor was no longer just a nice to have but it was a must have for our target audience. That part of what Apple had done was say that, you know what, for new generation of people, like whether you've got headsets or thermostats, whether you've got a TV show or a place to eat, they want some style and flavor. And so, how we designed, how we wrote, how we filmed, how we edited, whether we sweetened with music. We thought all of that was as critical to us as it was to HBO to Tesla to others. And so we thought that was the third piece. And then last but not least, we thought not only did we have to catch you up and vault you ahead and do it with style and flavor but if we really were going to win over our audience, they would never want to think that they missed out on something because Ozzy was really narrowly focused. That Ozzy was only telling them about the new and the next from the US. They'd want to believe that Ozzy was telling them about the new and the next period. And so, Ozzy from the very beginning was really global. And you spend time on Ozzy, you'll end up seeing stories from Morocco and Burkina Faso and Bolivia as well as from Boston and San Francisco. And so those were kind of the four big pieces that we set out with three and a half years ago and hoping that we would build for our target audience, which again, we called the Change Generation. Not the only place they would go for their news but we hope we would build the first and favorite. Now, take a moment on the Change Generation that I refer to. Often, when people hear me say that, they think I'm referring to millennials and as my mom would always remind me, it was more, she said, the Change Generation is a mindset. It's more of a psychographic than a demographic. It's people who aren't just okay with things being different, but people who actually often think of different as a positive connotation, different food, different clothing, different candidate, different person to spend time with. And so for those folks, we wanted to become their first and favorite, which might mean largely millennials and gen-exers, but not only. And so that was the journey we began on about three and a half years ago and give you a little bit of a demo. The presidential daily brief, as I said, we produce it every day and it's meant to say here are the kind of top 10 stories, but here on the right and on the left, you'll see usually about a dozen stories each day that we hope introduce you to the new and the next. And whether that's an opinion piece or whether that's a rising star, whether that's a piece from the world of politics or even what we call good shit. We hope that we're the place that you get a chance to discover the New Daily Show host a year before he's chosen or the first pick in the NFL draft or maybe the first time you read about a new book or a new TV show. We'll be on Ozzy. That's part of what we hope to bring to you. Ozzy is grown. Today about 25 million people every month will read us or watch us or listen to us. Slightly more women than men, about two thirds here in the U.S. about a third outside of the U.S. We've got about 75 people on the team, about 25 here in the Bay Area, 25 elsewhere in the U.S. and 25 around the world. And as we sit here at this moment, I probably would tell you that there are four or five things if I were talking to my younger self that I would say Carlos probably would surprise you about this journey. The first thing I would say is that at my first company when I started, I later on said that maybe one of the most important hires and the hires that you don't appreciate the value of as much is your head of finance, sometimes called your CFL, that until you have a really good one, you never realize how much money you can blow through and how unfortunate that can end up being. But I will tell you that one of the interesting challenges and opportunities that I've learned about this time is in many ways the importance of HR. The importance of the people who are in charge of people in culture is critical. And I'd say it's even more difficult today than it was when I started my first company. When I started my first company, very few people were entrepreneurs. You didn't have TV shows like Silicon Valley. You didn't have movies like the social network. You didn't have 500 startups. And so I think there at least was a little more mystery to what a startup was about. Today I think so many of us see kind of a handful of companies that win and do well. And we assume a lot of times that it's easier maybe than I think it is. And as a result, we see the good food and the cool drinks and the games that we assume that that's at the heart of it. And I would say that it has been humbling to realize that one of the most important things that I have to do as a co-founder and as a CEO is really help people appreciate how much hard work is going to go into it. And that no matter how much hard work we put into it, still relatively few of us are going to end up being meaningfully successful at it. That doesn't mean that we won't try hard. It doesn't mean we won't have a good idea. But I'd like to say they call it 500 startups for a reason because there's one Airbnb. And the other 499 or 400 who knows how many are people who are going to put a ton of time in and probably aren't going to end up exactly where they'd like to be. And so that actually was the first interesting thing which is that it became really important for us to get some help in helping our team think about what it's like to be part of a startup, what kind of commitment they're making, which may be different than what they see on TV or read about or hear about elsewhere. And so that was one of the surprises I would point out and then I would say. The second thing I probably would say to my younger self is a lot of times when you hear startup, we talk about the creativity that's involved. We talk about the energy. Sometimes we talk about the old nighters. We talk about the push. We talk about can you find terrific investors. I would say that one of the skills that I think is absolutely critical and that at least I didn't hear anyone talking about was the importance of being incredibly organized. It's funny, I think a lot of us think about startup and we think chaos and I think the reality is it's hard to get stuff done and it's chaos. And yet those places I think that are better organized that actually follow through that get things done that as simple as this sound have agendas and have follow up items and actually tick those things off, I think often disproportionately those are the ones that end up winning. I remember years ago talking to a guy named Bill Campbell. I don't know did Bill ever come and speak here as well. Bill who was advisor to a lot of terrific CEOs from Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Page to Jeff Bezos used to say that the biggest transformation he had seen in the last 25 years of advising CEOs was the number of visionaries who would become superior operators. That is he said they came to realize that no matter how big and cool their idea was, if they couldn't actually implement it, if they weren't really organized it on top of it and the kind of person who could bring it to life that it wouldn't come to life, that they couldn't simply hope that someone else was going to do it. And so I would say that would been the second thing that I would have emphasized and it's not a skill that you here talked about as much but I would say that probably was a second surprise. I would say a third thing that I probably would have surprised myself with a little bit is the beauty of a great partner. Who here has had a really good partner before in sports, in love, in life, in business? Who's had a great partner before? I should have known it. I should have known it but I had good partners at my first company but I learned it all over again. It's what's been interesting about this time around at Ozzy is in effect. I really feel like I probably have two partners. One partner is Samir Rao who we started the company together. Samir is from the Detroit Michigan area. Originally, a younger guy, we bumped into each other again. We had known each other a little bit but we bumped into each other in the parking lot of a Chipotle and there began something really good. And our other partner has been a wonderful woman named Louise Rogers who until recently led a kind of billion dollar digital company in the UK that just got sold a little bit ago but started life off as a waitress. We've been good partners even though I'd say maybe because we have very different approaches. I'd say if you gave Samir and me kind of ten scenarios and said you guys answer what you would do in these cases, I bet you Samir and I are answers even after four plus years together would only overlap six times. And with Louise I think we probably would only overlap three times and that's even after we've worked together a lot. So very different approaches and yet we have been I think we've been an incredibly effective partnership. I think there's been an openness to debate and I think we've been very willing to allow for lack of a better term silver bullet. So if it's clear that this matters to Louise and we can argue about it forever but the reality is that that's kind of where she is and this one really matters to her we're going to go in that direction same with Samir and hopefully the same with me. But I will tell you that finding that partner which I don't know that I can really say I can think of as a science and I don't know that I could give you great advice is to where to look for that because it really was a wonderful happenstance in the case of Samir and I coming back together again in that parking lot of Chipotle. But I will tell you that a great partner is a blessing and my wonderful fiancé says that as I was starting to think about what became Aussie I would complain a lot until the day that I bumped into Samir again. And that the minute I bumped into Samir that the complaining stopped and the progress started. And so I probably as someone who was driven and eager and confident I probably underestimated or as former president George W. Bush would have said, mis underestimated the importance of a really good partner and so that probably was another one of the things that surprised me. Last couple of things I will share with you that would have surprised me and then I will stop. I don't think of myself as someone and maybe it's come. I like to think that I'm open and I'm thoughtful and that there's not a ton of hubris and yet after our first year we had as good a first year as someone could have when we first got started. We felt like we launched with a good product. We brought in wonderful investors. We opened with partnerships with NPR in the USA today where we got to do very interesting things with them. We got a call from Bill Gates's chief of staff a couple months in saying our boss really likes what you guys are doing and can we send people down. We had all sorts of good things that started to happen right away and our audience started to jump really quickly in terms of size. Before the year was over we had on top of the angel round we had raised. We managed to raise a $25 million round which was fairly unusual at the time and fairly significant. We had a great year and then we punctuated it by absolutely and I don't know if you can add that. Absolutely just fucking up. As great a freshman year as we had and maybe some of you guys can relate to that we had a horrible second this sophomore year. It felt like everything that could go wrong did go wrong. We cared about design so much that we decided to redesign our site and our look and we did it in such a bad way that it literally screwed up our back end analytics and really messed up our traffic growth in really bad ways. Not dimension kind of pissing off our users. We went into the market and tried to hire folks who we thought would really elevate us to the next level and on paper these really accomplished people and I know in a lot of other circumstances they had done well and I'm sure still will do well but those turned out not to be the right hires for us so we made some hires that set us back and on and on again and so I think another thing I would say to my younger self is the minute that year seems too good to be true. The humble enough to appreciate that some of it was probably just good old fashioned luck and double down a fresh. The last thing I will tell you about my entrepreneurial experience and then I'll pause and would love to take some questions as well is I really like a blank sheet of paper. I know not everyone else does and I know sometimes it can be intimidating to think where you start and is this right or wrong but I if you like blank sheets of paper if you like getting to create something of fresh if that doesn't scare you but that actually kind of pulls you towards it and you love the idea of kind of building something new that wasn't there before then I will tell you that being entrepreneurs one of the most wonderful things possible there is nothing like going from a blank sheet of paper to a big win and whether that's the site getting launched whether that's thinking about ways to get people to fall in love and millions of people doing that last year we launched our very first television show meaning we took some of our digital series and turned it into a television show and sold that whether that's been creating an offline experience meaning a big festival where people who were reading and watching and listening to Ozzy could come in and enjoy all of that has been terrific and I think as much as I could have guessed that I would enjoy it I think for some of us there's a particular joy if that turns out to be you I think entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial opportunities could be terrific. So much more that I could say but I know I'm supposed to stop and take questions so that's a little bit about my journey about some of the things I've learned but I would love to take questions and go from there. So first of all Carlos you know thank you very much for your talk and it's very interesting to see you know like how you go you know from Stanford and to McKinsey to then working at TV and then like making the education startup and then now with the year with Ozzy. So would you say in your personal life has been like this red thread in your life that has been kept on waiver and constant? Yeah so so given that I've tried very different things from startups to larger places like McKinsey and Goldman to television to now Ozzy what would be kind of a a thread that brings it all that brings it all together. I guess this may sound a little weird but probably just a willingness and a confidence to try different things. I think a lot of times any of you guys have ever read Apollo Quello the author who wrote the alchemist a lot of other things he's got this great bit at the beginning of the alchemist where he basically says it we often spend so much of our lives trying to not listen to ourselves and to try and run away from it or to try and shut it down and whether we shut it down with alcohol whether we shut it down by going to graduate school that's not really for us but are for our parents whether we shut it down by doing something else that we're expecting to we spend lots of our life trying to not listen to who we really are and what we really want to do. I think for whatever combination of reasons I think for better or worse I was willing as I became an interesting most of us are interested in a variety of things I mean I think very few of us are interested in only one thing right like we could pretend that's true but like that's not really true right we all have lots of different kinds of music some of you probably listen to both Kanye and Sinatra right and and you don't think that's where you just think that's kind of who you are and that's kind of what you like and so I think I was willing to to try that I honestly think part of my willingness to try new and different things I often say I give credit not only to my dad but to my mom and and I've worked a lot with students over the years I think a lot of us aren't again we're making the Apollo quell are always encouraged to kind of pursue our dreams and really kind of believe in ourselves and there's a little bit of or a large bit of insecurity that I think that often prevents us from getting out of line right and so out of safety we kind of stay in line and we stay in the herd whether or not that's really right for us and I think my mom who had been a teacher she was she was a mother late in life so she got married late and then had four kids between the age of 36 and 41 which in that era would be like saying between 44 and 48 probably today so I think she's been a teacher for a long time and and I think she appreciated that people learn different ways and and she was a very affirming person and so I never take that for granted and particularly when I work with with lots of young people I realize a lot of people don't have that in their life so I know that's not exactly the answer you were expecting but but I think that that my willingness to to allow life to have some jagged edges and to not treat that as weird but actually maybe to say that that's maybe a little more real I think came probably from even though I didn't necessarily come from a wealthy background even though I didn't necessarily come from a family that had a lot of entrepreneurs a lot of people who had done TV or any of the kinds of things that sometimes would have made those feel safer and easier to do I think I think she just did a very good I mean a lot of things but but among the things is I think I was really fortunate to have a mom who just kind of saved like go for it and she often say like what's the worst that can happen she said I'm gonna love you no matter what she's like what's the worst that could happen and so again I'm very aware that not everyone has had the benefit of that and and I'm not saying that's the only reason why I ended up trying these different things but I'd say that that was part of it so I don't know if that is exactly the answer you were expecting or thinking yeah you know it's interesting some of you guys may have heard the wonderful commencement address given maybe a dozen years ago by Steve Jobs here at Stanford and you see the thing where he talks about when you look at your life and retrospect you know a bunch of things may come together from a calligraphy class to to other things in order to kind of make sense and obviously that kind of synthesis doesn't happen for everyone but but where it does happen that's that's a wonderful thing so I'll tell you that was that's probably it but a curiosity probably is the other piece too that I've always been that I've always been curious and and like good challenges and and like the sense that I'm learning and and probably felt like whether I was doing a startup or whether I was fortunate enough to be at a place like McKenzie or or whether I was hosting shows that I was that was learning and and I I am my mom used to joke they bought back in the day they had encyclopedias physical encyclopedias and they had a world book and people would come door to door and sell those and she and my dad made a big investment to buy them and they put them in my room and she used to say I've just read them for fun and so I think I've always kind of had this hunger for for learning more and and and and get a lot of joy out of that and so underlying each of these startups and underline some of the other work I've done that's a that's probably been a part of it when you were describing your first couple years we're watching the first year everything was fantastic in your eye top of the world and then you should hit the fan awesome everything was going bad but you stayed with we decided not to close the doors and something drove you through this really dark period and came through with something that's great what was it that did you ever feel that okay this I can need to change works totally and do something different or what was it that drove you through that dark period you know I'd probably say several things one just was a love of what we were doing so so I am fortunate in that that I actually genuinely love what we were doing and I and that's probably part of it and I always I still always feel lucky because I know that a lot of people work hard but never actually get to help start something and so as weird as that sound I always feel lucky and so even when that things aren't going well I realize it's not every day someone gets to start something probably responsibility knowing that a lot of people who wired real money to us a lot of people move from different parts of the country or world to come join us too so I realize that that can sound a little at worst paternalistic but I do feel like I have a responsibility to people who are betting on us and so I feel like I owe something to them you know kind of I'm naturally competitive but I'll tell you what you know what I've been getting a lot of motivation from even more recently sports I've always loved sports and the number of times and I'm not anyone here in New England Patriots fan I'm not a New England Patriots fan but those guys inspire me for those of you who aren't pro football fans this team over the last 15 years is one of the Super Bowl five times the only people who are in common not the only but the main characters who are in common are the owner the coach and the star quarterback now you could argue the star quarterback is the greatest of all time but last year they lose their second best player Rob Gromkowski right before the playoffs and do they give up do they wave the white flag do they say no moss no they get a guy who basically didn't play college football played lacrosse in college and put him out there and he's catching a half dozen passes in the Super Bowl and they're on their way to coming back and so I would say believe it or not all of these interesting comebacks in the last year whether it was a Cleveland Cavaliers I hate to say that here in the Bay Area but down 31 whether it's the cubbies whether it's in college basketball anyone in college basketball fans saw Villanova a year plus a go to Clemson and so that also has played a role to also the last thing I will say is that and when people used to say this to me before I didn't fully believe it but definitely being older has helped there are things that when I was in my 20s the first start up they would grind my stomach all night there'd be issues I'd worry about and I wouldn't get sleep for multiple days and I would just struggle with them and they would just they would just cause me the blues and I think that today with a little more experience and being able to maybe see things in a broader context they don't wear me down in the same way and so it probably is a little bit like a boxer who you know that same blow when that boxer was 18 or 19 might really ring their bell and now for better worse and so but but but also you know a number of times we've been really fortunate in having unexpected people on our team step up one of the best people we've hired was a guy you know we've we've hired a lot of journalists who came from classic backgrounds New York Times economist CNN we've hired some that have come from alternative backgrounds vice GQ but some of the best people we've hired are people I call cross trainers one guy had never been a journalist before he was a board lawyer and a small town in North Carolina and he is ended up no one else would have taken a chance on him he's the guy named Sean Braswell he's ended up writing some of our best pieces and in fact two of our first three television shows have been based on things that he's written another guy we just hired was an accountant for a restaurant chain in New Jersey and he loved what we were doing he pursued us for probably three four or five months he ended up writing about a dozen freelance pieces and when we finally met him we were like are you willing to take a pay cut or you willing to move or you willing to lean in and kind of learn this craft and make it work and he was and he's ended up being terrific for us so the other thing I think that probably also helped me get through was just seeing how hard other people were pushing and feeling like I mean I hopefully I would have done my part no matter what but but but definitely I couldn't let them do it and I'm not I'm not doing my part so up the things you've done that's the location you know Los Angeles there's a matter for the things that you're trying to do or you can do it anywhere and all that what's your assessment you know that's a great question so we're based here in Mountain View we're based locally and a lot of people have seen that as a as a bad idea a lot of folks have said as a media company you'd want to be with the New York Times and we're vice and vox and Buzzfeed and NPR and others are so likely New York or or DC or at worst you might want to be in San Francisco or Oakland and we originally were here honestly because my mom lived here and I needed to be to be close but I don't know I love Mountain View you know they always joke that I'm I should be president of the Chamber of Commerce because I'm such a big fan and I actually I I always wanted you know even after things changed and if I wanted to I could have I could have left the area I kind of wanted our team to be here because I felt like if we were in New York they would always compare themselves with vice and vox and Buzzfeed and New York Times and I actually wanted their competitive set to include Apple and Tesla and Snap and Uber and others and so I wanted them to really think big and to be open and I wanted the people who they were bumping into at dinner and at parties and at other places to include that set and not just the other set so I often admire what happened at ESPN which started in a little middle of nowhere no disrespect to Connecticut but Bristol Connecticut which is not exactly a bustling metropolis but that's where they built for what was has been for a time the most successful TV network and I don't necessarily think that's an accident and so yes I think a lot of times we would have an easier time recruiting um we'd have fewer issues with commuting and those sorts of things but I like being in Silicon Valley I like being somewhere different and I think in many ways it keeps us different and it makes us bolder and it makes us consider crazy ideas that turn into television shows or festivals or other sorts of things that I think we otherwise wouldn't have done because that's not what the most natural competitive set was doing I think we've been less followers and more leaders because we're called Mountain View the Wilderness but um but but we're we're not on we're not on the same path so I think that's been important one more question okay how does Ozzy make money and how does that compare to traditional media right so a lot of the folks you know whether it's the Huffington Post or Bleacher Report or Mashable or Business Insider or Vox or or others of the new digital media players have made money with advertising and they call it different things at times they call it branded content or sponsorship or they've got all sorts of kind of clever names with the bottom line is they're trying to get PNG and craft and other people to spend advertising dollars with them and I think that's a fine business and obviously Google and Facebook have proven that add dollars you can build a nice business based on that um we have uh uh done that and worked with a lot of good advertisers be they Netflix or Spotify or Hulu or others who who advertise on Ozzy but two other ways one as I mentioned to you before we started getting calls from Hollywood about a year after we launched and people were saying we like these series have you ever thought about them as a TV show or movie uh first time we heard that we got super excited and I went to go see some of the guys I knew at Vice and they were like calm down um I know you're excited but they whispered the same sweet nothings us and we didn't get our first big TV show for 17 years so it's probably not going to happen um but we still decide to go have the conversations with people and got really lucky and sold our very first show and uh subsequently have uh have sold two other shows and so television revenue is kind of a second way and then a third way is we do these pretty detailed reader surveys at the end uh of every year and within our first year we started to hearing from readers and viewers who said they didn't use this language they said I like I love Ozzy online but I almost wish I could meet Ozzy in the real world and um and so at first we started we started to think about doing small events in the way that fortune and the economists and the Atlantic and others have done recode tech crunch and so we started to think about doing small moments but a really smart woman who worked for the city of New York was like guys you're not being ambitious enough she said South by Southwest used to be this incredible thing it's become a little overrun little sprawly why don't you aim higher and build something of greater scale that not right away but over time maybe thought of one day as the new South by Southwest and so we made a five year commitment to the city of New York to build something called Ozzy Fest um which is a wonderful festival if any of you are in New York this summer in July uh the 22nd and 23rd it was described last summer is uh uh I think the times called it Ted Meets Coachella and so it's a really nice mix of musicians and actors and athletes and entrepreneurs and others and um and so that's become quite a revenue uh source for us so um there are three revenue sources for Ozzy uh so far which we're excited about which the only other player who's among the new players who we're doing that is vice that has multiple revenue sources most of the other ones from Buzzfeed to Huff Poe to uh Vox and Mike and Skim and those mainly are advertising and so we're hopeful that even though it was harder to really get each of these things going early on that we're hopeful of in the next four or five years it will be proud of the fact that we built good roots from the very beginning so thank you guys so much what a treat it was good to be with you I hope it was helpful thank you you have been listening to the great-for-fisher Jervison entrepreneurial thought leader series brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technologies Entries
