 Who you are defines how you built. This is the Auditorial Thought Leader Series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. Hello everyone, my name is Emily Ma and I welcome all of you to the Winter 2023 Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series presented by the Entrepreneurship Center in the Stanford School Engineering and Basics, which is the Business Association for Stanford Entrepreneurial Students. I am so excited to introduce all of you to my friend Elise Densborne to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Elise is the co-CEO of Splendid Spoon, a Director Consumer Meal Delivery platform that offers ready-to-eat plant-based meals. Elise was first introduced to Splendid Spoon as a customer. Over a decade in the finance industry, she joined the Splendid Spoon Team as a consultant in 2018 and quickly rose through the ranks in permanent roles as the Vigiant Finance and Insights, then CEO-COO, then becoming co-CEO in 2021. Since the decision to become co-CEO within Cole Centeno, they have expanded the menu to over 65 meal options, doubled the growth rate since 2020, and recently closed a 12 million series B-Round. Elise believes that food is the source for joy and connection and plant-based is the future for both people and the planet. Elise, welcome to the Stanford Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Thank you, Emily. Easy, easy question. Yes, your favorite smoothie. I have a favorite, but I want to know what your favorite smoothie is. My enough course fluctuates all the time, but my favorite right now is called Pineapple Passion Fruit. It was new in 2022, and it's just so vibrant and delicious. It's my far my favorite right now. So good. I am in the middle of drinking a raspberry cacao smoothie, so thank you. That's an oldie but goodie. Thank you for nurturing me so much. So now that we've gotten everybody's appetites went in a little bit. Tell us a little bit about Spundid Spoon. Maybe we could queue up the slides and you could show people some of this incredible menu that you have. Yeah, definitely. At this point, I just put together a few slides for context and sharing some of our visuals and our food. Just a little context for the problem we're trying to solve here at Spundid Spoon. So we know everybody knows and can feel right. It's a very high stress world roll strap for time. And people are more and more seeking food choices that have lasting impact. So these are a few tensions that we think about because they're pretty tough to solve, but they're pretty tough design challenge from a product and a business standpoint. And so just kind of like to tee up these tensions. So food that is both playful and functional, healthy and satisfying, convenient and high quality to eat and low impact for the planet around us. And we're all very at odds and opposing forces and that's what we seek to solve with our solution. At the same time, like Emily said, we've been around since 2013 and plant based wasn't quite where it is today as a movement and a trend. So of course we are loving where things are these days. And just obviously creates opportunity for a business, but also kind of like shows the shift in consciousness of sort of general society around the impact of plant based. So plant-centric diets are there becoming more and more mainstream. We have 87% of Americans adopting more plant based habits. And this doesn't mean completely plant based, but are interested in evolving their diets to include more plant rich foods. So what do we serve? We are just we view ourselves as food fuel. Excuse me, so not mouthful and ambitious and plant forward lifestyle. So all of our meals are ready to eat. There's absolutely no prep required. Everything is 100% plant based. So free from gluten and dairy. Our menu is very wide ranging. We're inspired by all global flavors and cuisines. And we really, really pack them with whole food ingredients and really thoughtful, balanced nutritional profiles working with our dietitian and our chef. What this means is we have 65 plus spews of nourishing soups, stews, grain bowls, noodle bowls, dishes, dinner trays or dishes as we call them internally smooth these juices and shots. So we're really seeking the sort of like take care of any moment in the day and really offer a solution for if you have sort of like a meal or just a moment in between meals where you're you're hoping to have a little bit of a plant plant based punch, if you will. All of our plans are super flexible. We do really responsive meal curations. We have algorithms funding or fueling everybody's unique menus. Definitely trying to have everybody enjoy our best flavors first. But then tailoring quickly to what people like and don't like. So what's our footprint and where are we actually ship all over the 48 contiguous states. So we have 200,000 customers 77% of which are outside of New York and California. So this isn't as an outdated couple years old, but it is a heat map of where we where we ship to and today we've sold over 13 million plant based meals. So we're super, super proud of that statistic. And a little bit about the business model and the e-commerce platform and how we approach innovation. So what sort of our tech enabled e-commerce platform. This business model design provides us is variety. So we have five new recipes per quarter with a really rapid innovation cycle. So for us that looks like six to nine months from concept to customer. And in a traditional retail environment that might be 12 to 18 months. So just to give a little bit of like context of of the opportunity there. That allows us to be take more risks with flavors and do it at a lower cost more sort of like agile way. And that way we can figure out what what customers like and love before we're trying to sit on a shelf. So that's definitely a competitive advantage for us. We also get feedback really quickly. So there's not sort of like a middle, like middle man between us and our customers. We are getting feedback immediately on what people like and don't like. And we can do so within about a 90 day period. We can understand if this is going to be a best seller or is going to be something seasonal or something that we just we didn't hit the mark and we need to potentially retire. Just a quick thing about the actual operating footprint because this is I think interesting and unique to how we do business that's one that's been. We actually have an entire third party manufacturing and logistics network. So we work with four different co manufacturers. We have these are manufacturing terms but hot fill bowl map tray and HPP capabilities, which just means that we have a different a wide variety of the way in which our food can be served to customers whether it's a bowl or a tray and we have different shelf life. So all of our food is flash frozen. And so many of our dishes, you have a 365 day shelf life on our smoothie and our fresh product. We have 90 days, which just means that there's a little more flexibility for the customer in terms of trying to anticipate their meal times. And us being able to kind of stock their fridge or freezer. And then from a convenience perspective, we are within two days from all of continental US. So that heat map, we can get to everybody in two days. So it's a pretty complex network. That we've really, really put all of our blood so it tears into over the last several years that we're really proud of and excited about from a business model perspective. And this is just sort of like end of the day. What are we trying to do here? Like we're really just trying to take care of one plan based moment of day for our customers and just really have that lasting impact on their lives. Having it there, then be more energized. We know our customers are really busy very full lives. And that takes a lot of fuel. So be more energized, more helpful and just have a meaningful impact on their health and their and that that of the planet. And it's just like a fun quote. I never knew vegan could taste so good as a customer review we've received. And that's what we're hoping to do is sort of shift the mindset and make plant based eating more enjoyable and more approachable for a wider group of people. That's all I've got. That's amazing. I'm hungry. The biggest challenge we're talking to you about this is that it's like about to be dinner time and all I can think of is what I want to eat. So, you know, before we do that, before we go to dinner, I have some questions for you. Sure. Amazing company. You and Nicole together run and your journey to becoming co CEO is rather unique. There's a lot of folks that we're going to speak to later in this quarter who are co founders, co CEOs from the get go. But you and Nicole had a journey to come together eventually. Could you tell us a little bit about that? Like how did she go from being like a super customer to being where you are at today? Totally. So I think the funny the funniest part of my journey with one of spoon is that it actually started at a birthday party. So I met one of Nicole's co founders and we were just kind of chit chatting and at the time I lived in the Midwest and I was working full time and going to school full time and was interested in plant based diet for my own personal like research and reason reasons. And kind of quickly shifted from sort of like what do you do to how do I sign up like it was a very immediate sale on the customer front. And so that was sort of like that my initial experience. I started as a customer that I was really excited about the concept and idea as an investor and then this co founder of Nicole's at the time had reached out to me actually when I was in transition. stepping away from my world in the industrials in middle market manufacturing and knew I wanted to go after the intersection of food and health and food and tech. But I didn't quite know how I was going to do that and he called with an operating problem at the time we had just launched smoothies and which feels like forever ago, but we had just launched smoothies and they are a different product line they have a shorter shelf life than everything else and. And I was like, I was going to work for some like bumps in the road as there are an early stage business building and I came in to sort of like parachute and and solve the smoothie purchasing problems, so that was sort of like. Part one, as you said, I was a consultant first, so I actually was a little like, okay, let me I just quit my job I'm in the Midwest, I don't know which way is up like let me do this part time. And that was my consulting project, so it was it was cool because it was a really nice way to sort of just like get introduced to a completely different size stage industry all of the things just by getting my hands dirty and and sort of like proving myself so to speak. And so at the time it wasn't I wasn't actually like seeking to join splendid spoon it was sort of just the next step and an interesting learning opportunity right where I was thinking of going. So after after we solved the smoothie problem we actually were hiring a VP of operations I came out to New York to train and transition to him and Nicole was like how about how about you stay how about you moved to New York and join the team. And so that was sort of like I came in as this like finance and strategy role, Spunitz Boon had just raised its series a at the time. And was just kind of a neat I mean it was like a seven person team so in need of really some additional sophistication and structures and systems and just tighter strategic thinking and things of that nature. And that's what I came in to do initially and I think the shift. Let's see the shift from from finance and strategy and sort of like basics there to COO was actually pretty quick there was a pretty. Quit there was a couple of just like between the smoothies and needing to build out a team for marketing and tech there was there was just a quick understanding that like the team reporting to me made sense just from like an operator standpoint I had a little more operating experience Nicole is a super talented chef super talented communicator and brand builder. But I had you know just graduated business school and had some of those more like operating skill sets and so we shifted pretty quickly into the COO and see a dynamic and early 2019 and that worked really well for us and it gave us a chance to sort of like find our ways in these new roles. And to build trust and to sort of like understand our respective strengths and weaknesses. But over time it pretty organically evolved candidly into sort of more of a partnership. And I think it was the beginning of 2021 we decided to like formalize this into a cozy a relationship. And it has been very effective for us. So there's there's lots of different bumps and bruises along the way, but it's been it's been a really effective model for us. And at least that's a huge highlight of this organization that you and Nicole now run and we have a number of other co CEOs coming to visit and and so you could last this quarter. And it's pretty unique. It's not you know it's a pretty unique structure that hasn't been around for that long, but you know a lot of research has gone into the space and turns out that you know companies co CEOs actually function much better for the most part. But certain things need to be placed. There's benefits. There's disadvantages. So knowing that you've been on this journey, so growing up through this one that's been like, how do you and Nicole make it work so effectively? Like what are things that you put in place or what conversations that you have? And you mentioned some bumps and about maybe a little bit about that and sort of talk about what how you've come to an agreement of this this unique structure. Totally. So there's like sort of the soft stuff and then there's the very tactical stuff. And so I'm going to start with the Smoshi stuff first, because I think it's actually the sort of like more important part. And so I mentioned sort of building trust and and fundamentally that is like absolutely a necessary element of partnership. We know all know that from our own experiences and any type of partnership or relationship, whether it's at work or at home. Trust is like absolutely foundational and key. And so we work really hard at that and have worked really hard at that, both through time, right. And and just working together and building that sort of rhythm. But also transparency and vulnerability and and being really like honest and uncomfortable and sharing our thoughts and our experience and not being afraid to say what you really think I think a lot of sort of the initial aha moments for us. I think we're an equal release saw a partner in me and not to speak for her, but this is like this is something she shared with me is one of. And early like moment we had where I was like we need to change this immediately or else like the business viability is a question. And she was like you know I just respected so much to have somebody tell me that directly and like fearlessly. And so that I think established a lot of trust for us. And so that just means really strong communication skills and holding yourself in each other accountable to what you say you will do and not do. And just be like open and gentle with each other when when there are misses because there definitely are there definitely fumbles were moving very quickly. And when you say when you say bumps in the road like what are some examples of that a lot of that has to do actually with the different stages of the business like as the business evolves and needs different things. And then the one thing I would say is that since you mentioned that this is a space which in my drive is let's look at the things that could go ahead and understand that do we have communication vaccine Because now I want to ask the whole that my show in Wall Street called our Skype go towards this very strong international community. But it breaks down. fully internally focused and I'm sort of like running the day to day. If we're in sort of like an innovation and building cycle, we may sort of divide and conquer the inside and be, she'll be a little bit more hands-on in things like innovation and sort of like brand philosophy and all sort of connect the dots cross-functionally and all of those things. So it really just kind of depends and I would say like our bumps have been when we're going through those transition phases if we're not communicating effectively if we're not like an orgynology like that this transition is happening at least for me I'm often like I just need us to like talk about it and make sure that we're like on the same page and and move like sort of rowing in the same direction. But we've never had any sort of like complete meltdown fights. It's always just been sort of the typical stuff and any sort of working relationship. You also I think like tactically you really do have to align on sort of what decisions you do need to make together and what decisions you don't and we sort of have this belief that there's only a handful of big decisions in a year that we need to like sit down, pause like really really dive deep on together and then we give each other a lot of room and trust to move quickly if one of us isn't in the room and we we work really hard to just bring the other one up to speed. So we have a really strong discipline of like weekly sinks and and touch bases but also just like keeping our egos in check and knowing when we actually need to be in the room or not and letting go when we don't and just saying I don't have to be a part of this every single time and then I think the other thing that has been really like pivotal to our successes is having sort of like a clear language for conflict resolution. We have like a practice framework across the organization of sort of like how to communicate through conflict and the framing and facts and judgments and asks and things of that nature and well Nicole and I don't typically sit down and like slow through our framework tool word for word. We do use that language like it is sort of just this muscle we've built where you kind of know if you're if it's if those words are being invoked you're trying to like negotiate through something a little bit sticky or debate through something or maybe there's divergent thinking. That's so powerful that note about being really intentional about conflict resolution. You know I we've had a number of speakers talk about how they didn't put that in place early on in a startup and that was the thing that got them right as they're kudos to you and Nicole for being so intentional about that. All right a quick palate cleanser and I know you and Nicole probably spent a lot of meals together. What is your favorite dish? Oh my favorite dish at Spondenspoon? Yes. I think it's the new risotto. It's got these like garlicly garlicy white beans that are just I think completely different from anything else out there on the market and just super super flavorful and satisfying. Okay I'm going to have more to that next. Okay let's dive back in. So earlier you mentioned responsive, menu curation and you have algorithms that do that. I loved what you had to say when you and I chatted about the role of technology in a food company and how you're really combining like the brains and the brawn. Could you maybe tell us a little bit more about the the tech stock and how that comes to interplay with a very very asset heavy business and dive into that for us a little bit. Totally yeah this is like this is like a hairy one it's a little abstract but also super like actually physical. So I mean there's a couple of ways to look at it and first is like sort of like the direct there's the demand side right there's like the thinking about customers and how sort of like our ecommerce platform allows us to do that. So like I showed in my presentation it's like we get the feedback we can innovate quickly we can take greater risks and we have greater certainty of like what is the sort of like dimensions of success and an amoeil and sort of like how customers are behaving in order patterns and things of that nature. So that gives us sort of like the tech elements of that and the data elements of that are definitely helpful in us meeting and exceeding and anticipating the customer need faster and better and then on the supply side it like we have this entire like super complex network of external partners and there's not really like it's evolved since we've started this for sure but there wasn't like a set tech stack when we started like Shopify was didn't exist once one that's been started so we actually like jumped into custom building very early on and I'll come back to that because we actually are in both worlds now but it's a very interesting thing of like stringing together and integrating all these disparate tech systems that are not ours just to fulfill orders and so that is sort of like those that that super disparate lean operating footprint has been one of our sort of secrets of success from our cost structure perspective but it required us to have really smart technology building and integrations of all these different systems. So I kind of view tech as like the bridge between these two worlds like you said the brains is sort of like tech forward and tech enabled and the bronze is like the raw muscle of actually producing a food product and old school been around forever one of the oldest like oldest industries right is like how you manufacture food sure we brought innovation to like the format and how it bring how it's actually produced and brought to scale and brought to customers at their doorstep but obviously food is not a new a new industry and so for for us like that is that is like both a cultural problem and a business design problem that we try to solve with with technology so from as it like as it relates to our actual tech sack we like I said we like we're a fully custom build and we think that's important for us to really own that customer relationship and to do this like business model design uniquely in the way that we do it and we also leverage the power of Shopify and the speed and the agility that that provides with all of the plugins and tools and the entire ecosystem that exists around that new technology to to market and iterate and communicate and understand how we can continue to invest what we learn from that experience and to our core platform which is actually something we stumbled into through COVID and a response to that market environment so there's been a pivot here and a pivot there but tech has definitely been a big part of what's enabled us to scale so quickly and rapidly with having such a lean team you know I am never going to look at my like smoothie ever whatever the same I'm gonna look at this raspberry cacao smoothie that had with me right here and I'm gonna be like wow there's a lot that went into that okay on the yes next side and on the production side and that's pretty amazing you know so on that note you just raised with Nicole a 12 million series B-round and you are two female coca-os raising funding and you've been very successful bring on board investors from including the red founders and the rent the runway founders and I'm curious what that experience has been like for you through the pandemic nonetheless yes for sure um it's been I mean raising money for everybody is a roller coaster um and it's not easy to do um and definitely was not easy to do during the pandemic so um actually that was like one of our pivots we had many pivots during the pandemic but that was one of them um which was that we stopped raising capital um so we had intended to raise at the beginning of 2021 um and instead after having some conversations and nobody sort of knew which way was up and nobody knew how this was all going to land and and um capital markets were essentially frozen um and so we quickly made the decision um to just press pause and say hey our our team needs us our customer needs us let's instead just sprint to profitability um and make some tweaks and how we do things and just delay the fundraise um so that's what we did in 2021 um in 2022 was sort of like uh or i'm sorry in 2020 and then in 2021 was when we actually raised um so what is it like for two female coceos raising money generally speaking um you know there's like pros and cons I think for us it's been um really helpful to have the two of us um we sort of like use our our superpowers um to have both of us sort of like listening um when one's talking the other one can be listening and it gives us perspective on um how to sort of fill in gaps show our respective strengths and weaknesses um sort of understand potentially what an investor is looking for and sort of play that off each other right and just have sort of like a more dynamic fundraising environment than just a single founder up their pitching um makes a little bit more of a conversation um and it also gives fun like it gives the investors the opportunity to see us work together and see that dynamic um and really you know have some confidence in in our like operating and um innovation chops you know like it just they can kind of see us work um so from that perspective I think it was really really cool I think the hard thing for us and I like when I reflect on what I took away um from the last fundraise is is sort of there at the whole the whole venture world is sort of designed around um white men candidly and stylistically um how how they communicate and how they think about business and all those things and I think one of the things Nicole and I um design for and have always designed for is optionality like we've always been here's plan a b c d um and have sort of like thought about things going lots of different directions and lots of different sequences all sort of aimed at the overarching mission and not being so hung up on the exact like how to get there and our experience is that um venture capital world responds much much more strongly to a definitive um this is exactly how the world is going to look and this is exactly how Spooned Spoon is going to fit in and of course it's like wrong every percolate almost every time but that sort of like singular like this is what it is and this is how it we will play um is definitely sort of like how things are designed so I would say that was like shifting our communication style or how we would even like um communicate and articulate the opportunity of Spooned Spoon definitely evolved um through the series b and take that away and and it's helpful right is obviously we do have like a plan a that we think is the most probable and so just communicating that a little bit differently um is definitely something that we had to learn that's incredible advice I also think it was really bold for you and cold to make that strong decision together to pause fundraising in 2020 and you know you you and cold did some things for your staff right you mentioned that your customers needed you but also your your team needed you so you know as you the pandemic unfolded it was very different world I know you need some pimp it says a business but specifically for your team you know with the cold kids at home you know many team members having family like what did you do during that time to stay resilient and what have you taken with you into these after days I guess totally totally um it kind of ebbed and flowed I think the the pandemic it's like 2020 was one version 2021 was another version it sort of like had this ongoing lingering effect but when I think about the early days of 2020 um I think there was a couple sort of like tenants um that that really helped us um and one was sort of like like we always do and always come back to it is really like grounding in our mission and our purpose as a business um in like it just so happens right like everybody's stuck at home and grocery store shelves are empty and people are working around essential workers are working around the clock nurses and doctors and and delivery people um and so on and so forth and and so we like we all sort of like looked within ourselves and we're like hey actually what gives us like the most purpose during these times is how we show up to the to the moment um and how we continue to do what we can do which is actually feeding people right um and so not only like feeding our customers and creating that you know a Shopify store that allows them to stock up beyond our typical subscription which is one thing we built in a weekend um but another was just sort of like shipping to hospitals and dropping smoothies in um to nurses break rooms and um just like doing offering what we could offer right because we were a fortunate business that was already set up to be remote first like we already had all of our um digital first communication tools um we've always had a flexible work culture because we really are want to be supportive of um families and the opportunity to work at home or elite at home and at work and so for us it was like that adjustment to working at home was not the big shift it was um how do we like channel our mission and our purpose into this moment um so and many of us like we really like we talked about it quite a bit and it was like actually the work gave us um something to focus on um and and um um I would say most people not I've obviously everybody's experience is different but I think most people felt um a sense of groundedness and having something to show up to every day and a sense of gratitude that we we were sort of um not being sort of completely like we weren't shutting down and we weren't laying people off you know we were actually going into overdrive and and sort of like experiencing that was a very fortunate thing for us um so that was definitely something like grounding in our mission um I talked about staying flexible I mean that was just we didn't have expectations we kind of like three road maps out um and it was kind of like a day-to-day week-to-week um there was you know we got to a sense of a little bit more normalcy after about six months but for those first you know march until September you know we were just um sort of reacting to the times um so we we did things like what we paused the raise and went for profitability and we built a Shopify store so customers could stock up um and and we you know like I said remote first was like a very quick decision and quick and easy decision for us that we've maintained and sort of held as part of our culture um so I would I would just say that um letting go of expectations and really just staying present um to what was right in front of us was was was a big part of that um and then for us as people there was just a lot of like holding space for each other um within our shared space so allowing people to show up wholly to their to their work um and not you know kids and background pets and background any of that's like there's like zero nobody bats and I you know like we are just like we just keep moving whatever time of day like having just sort of like the space for people to just fully be themselves and to say like hey I'm just having a hard day today I just need to take a break like this is becoming overwhelming um that was like what we did with our shared space um and then we just prioritized um some fun some play we like actually drew with um hot sauce we like drew animals with hot sauce one night um like it's just you know like we were like trying to to have a little fun in the middle of it take it making a little bit um lighter um and yeah just like having people be able to communicate their needs their emotional states um and create the boundaries that they need to to pause um and to to step away um for Nicole and I there was very much like a tag team between her sort of newly uh she had had a newborn on our March 12 so so um yeah that was that was fun so like she and I sort of like tag team back and forth and then I got COVID shortly thereafter and so um yeah just holding space for each other and having each other's backs um was a big part of it as well well that's incredible I have one final question and a little bit of dessert so my final question is a question that we ask all of our guests which is if you can go back in time to when you were a much younger and in this case I'll plant the moment as your first day in business school when you knew that you wanted to shift from what you were doing prior to this school to food and health and food and tech um but one thing that you would tell that version of yourself today um this is such a good question um oh my gosh it's hard to pick one what one piece of advice I the one thing I've been thinking about this year a lot actually is um is really taking the time to like nurture your intuition and so I you know the first decade of my career was very focused on hard skills and experience accumulation and then I went to business school full time on the weekends and it was like cases and reading and everything that I could just I was like consuming constantly um and I think I would I would tell myself to spend just as much time sort of like stepping outside of that um and like kind of going internally and creating a little bit more and nurturing sort of like that that um softer side and that creative side um and that intuitive side um because truly like I think the the hardest part of leadership is really sifting sort of signal from the noise and you have to have a really clear um groundedness and connected to connectedness to all parts of yourself um and all the signals that are coming in um both sort of like you know what you're reading and hearing and consuming but then also just what you're feeling and and um experiencing and absorbing from the world around you and and so um I think that would be the my business school very ambitious um self I would that's the number one thing I would tell myself you know I think I have to tell the other version of myself that that the same thing because turns out we have to go right back to food we have like millions of neurons in our gut and so guts are thinking for us and we have to take care of our guts so exactly honor of our guts if you could indulge in one thing what would that be oh this is easy french fries every time it is plain face so it is it is but it's so like salty and delicious oh wait too good all right we're gonna dive in to some audience questions so how do you nurture your creative side now are there specific things that you do yeah totally um so there's a I kind of like think about it in two different ways they're sort of like the inspiration and um the like consuming of things and then they're sort of like the producing of things so I try to nurture both um and I would say it's bear I mean I live in New York so it's very easy to consume all of the interesting um art and culture and entertainment and food all the time um and so that is sort of like a important thing for how I spend my time outside of work you know I really do try to prioritize um something inspirational um and creative about like I'd say at least like once a month that I'm like being really intentional with it of course I'm like always going out to eat and experiencing lots of rich things but just sort of like having a little like artist date with myself um is is one um thing that I do um the other is for me my creative process is actually most commonly um writing um so I will do yeah I'll do I mean there's like personal like journaling and things of that nature um but I also will just sort of um it's sort of my mode for like synthesis and expression generally speaking and so I just have a really strong discipline of of um reflecting on weeks and even days um and really just like making space um heriting amazing do you write nonfiction or is it um fiction? I'm not there yet I'm not there yet I'm I'm more in sort of like observation um and um insight and sort of like connecting dots because that's a lot of how my brain works um and parallels in different universes that I'm experiencing um but you know I think that would be actually a really good thing for me is to like I would love to take a creative writing class I think that would be really fun I'm gonna call you up in in a year and ask you eventually fair enough each other accountable for these things all right a couple of more questions coming in so this is an interesting one uh healthy meals are oftentimes more expensive than cheaper easier options for families so you know like a lot of eggs will take people to fast food they're families to fast food because it's easy it's quick and it's cheap so how do you think about that making it more you know accessible across various socioeconomic backgrounds? totally um we we talked about this and think about this all the time because decidedly like our meals aren't um you know they aren't accessible to everybody at the price point today um and we're completely and fully aware of that our average meal prices is for context is between like nine and ten dollars after all of sort of like our pricing mechanisms um and so they are um they aren't you know three to four dollars that you could potentially get in a grocery store um but they are I think in some instances they they can be competitive with fast food these days depending on what you're buying um but I digress um so how we think about it um we're actually talking about this in terms of like long term um scaling for us and our ability to reach scaled for from a consumer standpoint um also allows us to manufacture at different in different ways um and have a lower cost of inputs um from like ingredients and labor and automation of those things um so we think a lot about that in our co-manufacturing um system design and um our long run omni channel strategy is our hope of how we will we will reach um sort of like more accessibility but we also know like we're not going to completely sacrifice on on quality today and that is just the reality um of manufacturing um the type of food that we manufacture um hope as as it becomes more mainstream all of these things do become cheaper and cheaper um the other thing is we do um we do talk about um volume purchasing on our site even like being able to reduce your price or your cost um per meal if you're buying and bulk which is also good for the planet right if you're getting more and throwing it in your freezer there's less transportation and so that that is sort of like a win-win um and we also share hacks so a lot of our um soups and and bowls actually um work really nicely as sort of like added with grains and rice and extend it to like an entire family that's actually what I do a lot um I like put a soup on top of rice and add some greens and um it can sort of like feed um definitely multiple people um and you know obviously that isn't like forever in scalable solution but it is a right now thing that that we encourage people to do well it's amazing that you're thinking about these things and I know you're targeting a very specific group of individuals at the moment but um it's part of your just to think about the broader aspects of this too all right I'm gonna ask more questions and then we're gonna close out so um this one's an interesting one uh what are some of the competitive advantages that allow your company to build a move uh outside a first-mover's advantage from larger companies like Amazon who can potentially mobilize really quickly yeah totally totally oh it's such a good question um so I have I mean I have a little thesis or philosophy that there isn't really a first-mover advantage when it comes to the hearts and minds of consumers so it isn't the same um sure there's timing always matters and sort of like momentum definitely matters um that is true and like capturing demand is definitely true but there is a look there's something a little bit different when you're when you are sort of like speaking to an individual um about a product about a brand about a lifestyle that does sort of transcend that like you can have a new brand at any time that if it is more relevant um if it is more um like meeting of a customer expectation they will switch and so it's a little bit different than like a technology or a um sort of like a supply chain first-mover advantage um and so we actually I mean that's how we think about our competitive mode um we think a lot about um our brand equity and our innovation process and skill and just our ability to make better food a better product it's it's sort of like the the fundamentals like we talked about brands and brands it's kind of going back to like those basics of customer um of brand and of product um and if you get those three things right and it is unique and and um just delivering more value um there's less of a uh timing or um sort of like space there's there's more space it will grow and and our market has grown um and that has been our experience as more people have entered the plant-based space it's also made the market bigger um so we credit things like impossible burger and beyond meat for like really widening our market um and they're not you know we're not we're we don't use their products but we use you know me alternatives and some of our products and it's delicious the entrepreneurial thought leader series is a Stanford E-Corner original production the stories and lessons on Stanford E-Corner are designed to help you find the courage and clarity to see and see these opportunities Stanford E-Corner is led by the Stanford Technology Ventures program and Stanford's Department of Management Science and Engineering to learn more please visit us at ecorner.stanford.edu
