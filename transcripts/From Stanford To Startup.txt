 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. It is my sincere pleasure to introduce our two speakers today. We have Mike Reaver and Kevin Systrom and I know they actually very, very well because both of them were Mayfield Fellows. In fact, Mike was Mayfield Fellow in 2007 and Kevin in 2005. They took part in this nine month work study program that we do and essentially is an opportunity for students to get a deep dive experience in entrepreneurship during the first quarter. It is a classroom exercising that a lot of case studies about different aspects of entrepreneurship during the summer they worked in startup companies and the fall they come back and each present a case study about the company they work that summer. And the summer when Kevin was in the program he worked at ODO which ended up becoming the precursor to Twitter and Mike worked at Fox marks which is now called PhysiPops. So the two of them would not have known each other if it had not been for their experience in the Mayfield Fellows program. They have done amazing things since then. Kevin worked at Google for a couple of years and Mike went on to look at Meebo before they decided to get together and start their company. They have wonderful things to tell us about their experience and I won't get in the way and let them start. So welcome back to Stanford. Thank you so much. Thank you Tina. Thanks so much for having us Tina and Stanford. It's great to be back here. I think I remember how many years ago now like four or five sitting in this exact room and watching people stand up and give advice about entrepreneurship and their experience and it's a little surreal to be standing up and giving back but it's a really exciting opportunity because I think in the past year or so since we started what would become Instagram we've learned a lot and today what we want to do is go through a series of myths that we think we had kind of like learned along the way or thought were true along the way and as we did Instagram and as we went through the process of founding this company we learned that not all of them were necessarily true. So the big caveat here today is although we're saying all this stuff you know experiences what matters and going through your own experience in a startup is really what helps you debunk these myths as well. So this is our chance to share some learning with you guys. My background obviously I went to Stanford, Mike went to Stanford. I studied at MSNE, Mike you studied Simpson's Simsis here and really like you know that was the beginning of our entrepreneurship you know experience in the Mayfield Fellows program. Mike Tina said we both had really amazing internships then that got us to kind of get interested in entrepreneurship and get excited about doing it when we got out and both of us after you know a year or so of working at a larger company decided we wanted to do something and hopefully today through that experience we can you know shed a little light on what we learned. So what we're doing today Instagram is really is kind of interesting because it came out of something we were doing before that didn't quite work. How many people here have actually heard of Instagram slash use it? Okay, awesome, most of the room. How many people here have heard of bourbon slash use it? Use it yeah like three people that's awesome. So that's why we started working on Instagram because that's basically the number of hands that went up in the room when we were working on it. Bourbon was this check and app that lets you check into different places and while you were doing that allowed you to share pictures or videos of what you were doing. Long story short we worked on that for a little while and then realized it wasn't really going anywhere but the thing people love the most about it was actually sharing images of what they were doing. So today Instagram has about a little less than four million users all sharing images of what they're doing out in the real world through their iPhones on a daily basis. How many iPhone sorry how many mobile photos do we upload per day about now? It's like, geez it's six a second more or less so whatever that times. Yeah it's a lot and this is pretty awesome to be in this position you know only like six or seven months after having launched. But you know the myths we're going to talk about today I think like really helped us get to the next level on start Instagram by learning that those myths weren't necessarily true. So to start I think Mike's going to bring you through the first myth. So the first one when you're just starting out and you're dealing with like the bucket of uncertainty that is being an entrepreneur and getting started it's you want to latch on to things that you've seen before. We really quickly learned that you just cannot really learn to be an entrepreneur from a book, a blogger or a talk and it turns out that a day on the job was worth a year of experience. And what happens is the collection of experiences and knowledge you can get from those sources is super important and I'm not like dismissing them entirely as something that you should get to or just ignore. But that first day when you're starting to make those decisions where the data isn't really there and there hasn't been a blog post posted to hacker news that was like deciding what to do on the first day of your startup or making this really tough decision. It turns out a lot of it is very specific to your situation and all you can really learn to do beforehand is try to deal with that uncertainty. So making snap decisions or quick decisions in the face of a lot of uncertainty. So we'll have we'll hit up on situations early on where we weren't sure if we're going to take Instagram a follow model for example like Twitter or more like friendship like Facebook and there's just no blog book or talk that we could have ever really seen beforehand that would have taught us to do either of those things. So instead of about sitting down and saying well what do we know beforehand what does our gut tell us and trusting your gut is I think a theme of this talk and so developing a better gut is the work you can invest in beforehand and then saying all right let's invest in this. Let's stay the course for a while and really like see it through rather than wavering for a month at a time being like why don't we build both then like we'll switch off and maybe have like a little like maybe make a preference like worst mistake ever right is to give up on making that decision instead of making it a preference. And so on and so forth where you're having these micro decisions that in the end sum up to what becomes your product basically and we really rapidly found that as tempting it as to go like search off for you know prior prior accounts of something similar that snap decision is what makes a difference but what you can be doing is doing quick projects side projects during school even when you're outside when you're doing a job and most of what we learned and applied into our startup were things that we were doing on the weekends which you know depending on the company's out of something encourage or discourage but usually if you're excited enough about something you will find the time to work about it to work in it. The other thing is once you do start a startup it's super tempting to get caught up in the meta part of doing a startup so going to entrepreneurship events and being like yes like I want to talk about being an entrepreneur like going like there's we were incubated a dog patch labs which was a great experience we were surrounded by 30 startups a rotating cast we were there for probably longer than anybody else too long so like we saw three or four different classes of startups go through that and the successful ones were the ones that were in at nine a.m. and left at 10 or 11 p.m. and we're just like putting in the work and not the ones that showed up at 10 like hunger out left at six who like in my opinion we're doing a startup as a lifestyle choice because they didn't want a boss like that's not a really good enough reason to do a startup it should be that you wake up and you're obsessed with this idea and you want to make it happen and you're not there to like hang around in like this club or like have this like fun chat with people and that distinction wasn't that a pair into me day one because everybody's doing a startup this should be a thing and then one month in people like you guys work really hard like you kept hearing that comment at dog patch and like we weren't we were working like the hours that we felt we wanted to like throw into this startup and I guess it's a gut check if you're finding yourself like getting drawn into the meta part of the startup of like being an entrepreneur and being really excited about somebody sent to us earlier when it phrased it like you can't call yourself an entrepreneur somebody has to call you an entrepreneur in a way and it's true like it's very tempting to get caught up in that now it encouraged you to like step back a little bit and like find out the only thing that shifts products and the only thing ultimately end users care about is the product you deliver to them not like how they talk about you and tech roads or exactly who your investors were or which events you attended another myth that we you know encounter it as we started our company we talked to our friends who are like holding back from starting companies is that startups only come from computer science students now they're Kevin or I studied computer science and that's something that we're like actively proud of not because computer science is a bad degree by any means but because it means you can get the technical chops you need to get things off the ground to get things prototyped and shipped we built all of the initial version of Instagram ourselves from things we mostly just were self-taught in the early Twitter employees none of them even went to college and our first engineering hire didn't go to college either I think the Twitter maybe they didn't finish college maybe they went to it but it turns out there's things you can do in school that I think are valuable and when you're trying to pick courses and figure out where to focus your time the classes I look back to now and think wow those are the ones that helped me deal with that uncertainty day to day are the ones were day one of the quarter they tell you we don't know what you're going to be doing for the next rest of the quarter you'll get this at the D school lot and all the entrepreneurship classes it's your job to ask the question figure out the question that you're going to tackle and then answer it for the rest of the quarter and it's just a very different experience from well these are the 10 problems that you're going to tackle and then we'll deliver them at the end of course going through those motions is really important as well but having that ability to ask the question and Kevin will talk a little bit more about this in the next one but also just work through the rest of that of that quarter and the rest of it is the the engineering we end up doing we we call sink or swim school of engineering so we launched on this like little machine server in Los Angeles we had no idea what we were doing we're like well like maybe some people will sign up within 24 hours we had so much demand on that one machine that all of a sudden we had to scale out to like what we now have like millions of users none of us had touched Amazon's cloud platform at all before launching we'd kind of heard of it but shyed away from it and it turns out that like there's no motivation stronger than a bunch of people knocking at your door saying I want to use your product like fix your thing and you know we've put in like a lot of I don't really remember the first two months of our startup because we didn't sleep and I think short-term memory goes out the way out of the way so I'm told we put in a lot of late nights that we're all about saying what do we need to do to get our product to a place where people can like keep using it get excited about it scale to the challenge and you'll learn those things because you're bright intelligent you started a company because you trust yourself so having that faith and not showing away from a big challenge because you're like well what if we're successful we won't know how to scale like I barely the really knew how to use like a lot of the Linux like system in stuff and now we know it really well and like probably if we did it again we'd have a totally different approach but it's a little bit of like zen beginners mind you focus on the simple important stuff first if you're not worried about scaling ahead of time it's really good to have friends that are computer science absolutely it's all about building that right the either a week one I had worked at Mibo beforehand and I was doing mostly front-end development so I wasn't doing you know a lot of hardcore scaling stuff and I remember like 8 a.m. and the more I'd be awakeing at my friends but I'm more normal normal jobs be like I have no idea what this means like how do I do this they'd come in we'd buy them beer and you build that network and they'll help you out because they're excited about what you're doing and it becomes less about feeling like you're like being entire source of knowledge for your stuff right and I think what I'd add to the original point of like you know going to you know events or talks is that it turns out what you get from those things aren't necessarily you know the takeaways that we're going to put up here on the board but it's the people sitting next to you it's the people you meet before the event after the event the people that you're sitting next to chatting with them about the stuff that you're doing that end up being the most valuable part of your entrepreneurship experience going down the line the fact that I remember being at a party I think it was like maybe sophomore year in college when Facebook had just moved out and I ran into Adam D'Angelo who was the CTO at that time at this little party and we kind of kept in touch since and on the day we like went down that first day we launched we had all these problems I was like who's like the smartest person I know who I can call up and the Adam spent like 30 minutes on the phone with us just walking us through the basic things we needed to do to get back up and like those little events are the things that matter so you know as much as you're paying attention to the stuff on the slides make sure to spend some time after the talk getting to know the people around you absolutely I think myth number three that I'd like to talk about this is something I had no clue about it was that finding the solution to the problem is the hardest part I always thought like you're faced with these problems that people have right you assume that you know exactly what you're going to tackle and the hard part is finding that algorithm right the hard part is scaling that solution it turns out thank you Mike that the hard part is actually finding the problem to solve solutions actually come pretty easily for the majority of problems not for every problem but for the majority of problems and in our case what we did was when we sat down and we were deciding to work on Instagram what we did was we wrote down the top five problems people have with mobile photos because we wanted to build a product that solved problems we didn't want to just build a cool app to like look for a you know problem that people had we wanted to do it the other way around so what we did was we listed out these five problems and I remember the top three that we circled number one was that mobile photos don't look so great right like we've all had that experience you're seeing the sunset you take a snapshot and it looks like you know washed out you can barely see the sun etc and we were like that's like the major problem we want to solve number two was that uploads on mobile phones take a really long time so we were like what could we do around that and we're like well maybe if we start the upload way before you're done even editing the photos caption and what if we like size down the photo just to fit perfectly on the screen but nothing else and that's like the small little problem and solution that it turns out really delights people because they press done entering their caption it's already been uploaded right the third problem was that we really wanted to allow you to share out to multiple services at once we felt like do should you have to make the decision of taking a photo with the Facebook app the Twitter app so on and so on or should you just take it in one place and distribute it to many places at once right those top three problems allowed us to really hone in on what solution we wanted to build and that's really what Instagram became I also wanted to say that you know once you have those top problems that you want to solve you need to verify that they're actually the ones that people have and really the way to do that is get your product in front of people very quickly and test that hypothesis I think too many people wait a long time and I'm going to talk about this a little later too many people wait a long time to see whether or not what they're working on is actually the problem people are having and the last point is that really you should not be afraid to have simple solutions to simple problems like I said early on I think too many people believe you have to solve things in a really complicated way and at the end of the day if you delight people even a little bit with a simple solution it turns out it goes very far and that first day when we had like something like 20,000 new users I was like clearly there was a need for this that hadn't been done before and I'm so glad we tackled those simple problems there's something about like you know in the tech community you always want to feel like you're working on the hardest problem in the world it turns out that simple problem becomes very hard at scale and that's what's really exciting in a way like we often in our entrepreneurship classes to hear about the big harry audacious goal like what's the huge chunk you're trying to bite off and tackle and one thing that really struck me was that that big harry audacious goal could be bringing that simple solution to something delightful to the masses and that in itself is a huge challenge yeah and it's something we deal with on a daily basis right like Mike has to wake up at 4 a.m. every day to like reset servers and stuff and like I wake up with him but I don't don't actually do anything I just say okay Mike I'm here with you so myth number four this is what I was talking about before working for months to build a robust product in secrecy and then launch the world how many people have heard of stealth startup started a stealth startup feel like they would you know go into entrepreneurship and keep their ideas to themselves I'm going to assume everyone's going to raise their hand because like we've all heard of the stealth startup how cool it sounds right the problem with stealth startups is that you don't get the feedback you need quickly enough in order to test whether you're working on the right thing or not you need to put it in front of people and I think there are certain verticals like I'm really talking about consumer internet here specifically I think there are certain verticals outside of consumer internet where stealth problem may might make sense if you're doing pharmaceutical or something right but for us like getting it in front of users was like the most eye-opening experience I remember putting bourbon in front of people we didn't know and they were just like what is this thing like what are you doing right we would be in a busy bar and trying to explain to them on our mobile phones and they just like wouldn't get it and that happened enough in front of people outside of our friend group that it was like really clear we had to work on something different or at least refine the idea and I think that's something to keep in mind as you're going about you know starting a startup building the minimum viable product is super useful don't build past what you need to build to answer the questions I think too many people like I think Eric Reese talked about this all the time and he says he was at his job and he was building this 3d chat client and the idea was you could basically like link your Yahoo messenger your MSN messenger like all these different messengers to this one 3d client and he spent like eight weeks doing it and then they launched it and no one used it and he said to himself like couldn't I have just done one of those platforms to prove that no one used it so ask yourself like how much work do you need to do to actually prove whether or not this thing is going to sink or swim right the sink or swim school of engineering we should like write this book right it's really true though everything we do at Instagram we start by saying what's v1 of this feature like what's v1 of this thing that we're going to put out in two days and test whether or not it's going to work I think that's super you know important to remember the last point here is failing early and failing often it's totally okay to fail in an organization you need to fail in order to find the right solution often the first thing you start off with is is not the thing you end up with and you should like assume from the start your first idea is not going to be your last and your job is to fail your way to success and I think that's what we did in bourbon pretty well we failed all the time and finally we woke up one morning we're like we're failing too much we need to move a little bit to the right and even in Instagram we failed a bunch with different features and things right but the idea is you're constantly refining this original idea right it's not this wake up one morning and have the brilliant idea and go implemented it's you're constantly iterating on it this one's kind of interesting because I feel like in all the books I read in college people are like what you want to do is you want to build this beautiful slide deck with graphs going up into the right and you want to go up and down Sanoha road and tell everyone that yeah Kleiner's in on the deal are you in on the deal and you know you play everyone off each other I'm like I just when we were like going to raise money I said to Mike I was like I don't want to meet with all these people like what I want to do is I want to seek out and if we can actually show the reality I want to seek out the people we really want to work with I think instead of optimizing for things like valuation you should consider optimizing for people there are a lot of venture capitalists out there with a lot of knowledge and I guarantee you your idea matches really well with a select group of those folks in a way you have to think about um bringing on venture capital as you're hiring part of your team and who are the people you want to hire and I think far too many people we talk to you even at an angel stage are like we need to optimize for like getting some ridiculous valuation right out of the door and then they end up with some VC firm they don't have a lot in common with and they don't get along and like bad things happen it's all about the people and I think that's what you have to remember when you're going out to raise money find the people that believe in what you're doing that are going to give you the capital to achieve your goals the other point here is you can go off and raise you know 40 million dollars in a series A but it turns out you don't need a lot of money to get off the ground these days we spent like 60K to launch our first version of Instagram 60K we had raised 500 and we were like kicking ourselves the second day after I was not after we raised but after things started taking off we were like we have all this money left over and we got this far like it turns out you can bootstrap yourself with Amazon web services is like you need like two engineers these days to do things well and it turns out that like you know you can get a lot done on it on a shoe string budget especially with all these incubators and things these that are happening these days it's something to remember so the main takeaway here is optimize for people don't optimize for valuation because like if you have a great idea it's going to get a great valuation you're going to do well but those people are what make the difference the second point on this side I just want to make very quickly is that bringing a prototype into a pitch meeting is so much more powerful than a bunch of graphs that say you're going to make lots of money in the future like prototypes are tangible prototypes are things that people can sink their teeth into and use and react to and ask questions about I remember like I have yet to create we have yet to create a pitch deck for Instagram we don't have a pitch deck anywhere it was always a prototype that we brought in and we showed I think that like while you should probably create a pitch deck and that's probably not like you know a lesson to learn from us what's more important is that I think people really attach themselves to prototypes so that's kind of how I think about the whole financing of startups and I think that while you go off into the world to start a startup just keep these lessons in mind another myth is that starting a company is building a product I remember getting so excited when we were starting bourbon that we had all these feature ideas we had all these product ideas to work on but it turns out that starting a company is like 50% building a product and 50% a lot of other stuff bank accounts insurance like taxes that you didn't know existed right filing for things in the city of San Francisco informs in the basement of city hall to make sure that your founder from basil can can get a job with you right like there's all this other stuff that isn't about having brilliant product ideas that takes a lot of work and I think when people decide whether or not they're going to go into entrepreneurship you need to remember that you know building a product is great but there's a lot of legwork involved in getting a team off the ground I think specifically in recruiting a team team building is one of the most important things when you get off the ground it's not just about having a great idea it's finding the people to bring in to to make that idea happen and supporting them by shielding them from the press and the like checking accounts that you have to set up etc especially raising capital that can be a huge time sync and you don't realize that until you get into the flow of things that building a company is not building a product at the same time it's you know supremely important to know that you have to be good at building a product and they're going to be willing to do the legwork to do the rest as we wind down for the last two minutes you might be seeing they're going okay so what's next like how can I take it when will I know I'm ready like how do I know that it's time to go and start a startup and what's it going to be like for the next you know a few years and it turns out it's not the idea that's going to hit you while you're walking down a street or in the shower so I kind of mentioned I'm from Brazil originally and I'll do all these interviews back home where like entrepreneurship is still like a buildup is like a building process and like it's not as much in the culture as it is here in the valley and they're always asking me like when do you have your idea like what a great idea you guys had like what struck you guys and there was no one moment where we're like oh yeah like photos with filters and ideas really are the result of a lot of these iteration steps that we've talked about earlier and your job is just to explore the solution space until you figure it out where in that solution space you fit and it turns out people are always like well like this is my idea need to be the most like unique thing in the world now it is especially in the social space ideas are combinatorial right it's a matter like that childhood exercise where you take different parts of the animals and you make a new animal out of it that's a lot of the startups are like you're saying like well like there's things about Twitter we really like but it frustrates us that we don't have an emotional connection with the content that we're receiving because it's not visual you know and there's things we lack about things like heapsdematic with like these cool ways of making your photos look better but the photos get caught on the phone and they don't really get to like connect with your friends through them so these combinatorial ideas are really where you end up having these aha moments later after you've explored the solution space rather than like the shower idea that ends up like you know killing them and as we've mentioned before in the sharing and discussing process is where those ideas get refined so getting that consumer validation going through those bar exam we call them bar exams like you're in the bar can you explain your idea and show it off to your friend with the in a way that they're not going to be like well really loud and people are drinking and they have like the other 50 things they want to do and one thing I really want to emphasize is that careers are very much like a series of themes that you go through and explore in your career if you look at Dennis Crowley at Forest Grower he's been working on that drive on that idea around location and then locking your city for almost 10 years or more like he's probably thinking about this it's like maybe the sketching is like a kindergarten or I don't know no and we both that just into photography and kindergarten right we've been like excited about photography and about communicating the real world for years and probably whatever we do for the next 30 years we'll have some hint of that forever so very much so your startup and your career is an expression of you and your co-founders in a way that expresses like what are the themes that are going to recur throughout your careers and you'll know when you hit upon that for yourself because like you will wake up every morning and you can't think of anything else during the shower and you're like oh we can do this different thing and that's when you even know you've hit the great idea it's not just the idea it's the theme it's the drive it's the problem you want to solve out in the real world like what question are you answering and the good slash bad news is that even once you've have that drive is that it's not going to happen overnight and one of my favorite quotes is from Biz Stone who he wrote Twitter was an overnight success that took five or six or seven years and it's just absolutely true there's things seem very obvious in retrospect and you're like well of course like photos like why not right like that makes total sense people like oh that idea is just waiting around forever but it's the relationships you've built along the way it's the fact that Kevin and I knew each other through the Mayfield Fellows program and so we had like connected before and when he was starting to think about a co-founder it was someone we could connect to it's the fact that on the weekends back when I was working at Mibo I really wanted to learn iPhone programming so I took the San Francisco crime database and I made this silly like augmented reality like crimes around you application you know and then so I had a little bit of iPhone experience and the friends I could call at five in the morning when it's like I don't know what this message mean like please help you know and again it's the themes that you've built up throughout the career and the line that you're weaving throughout your life in a way that informs your startup and makes it happen and it never gets easier is what we found and that's okay and you adjust that reality after a few months and you stop telling people like oh when I'm get less busy you're never going to get less busy and that's okay and once you accept that and love it then I think your life is a lot happier as a as a startup founder but it is a long slog and I think that's what people don't realize and I certainly didn't before like you think these startups happen in like the courts of a year but it's a it's like a lifetime commitment in some ways right I'm prepared to do this for many many years going forward because I feel like we're at the tip of the iceberg and I can see it we have four people in our office right and we only have four-ish million users like I can see this becoming much much larger and what excites me is that challenge and I think part of entrepreneurship is realizing different things along the way are going to excite you in different ways and the people that grow best with companies are the people that realize that and get really amped about the different challenges at different stages of the company and I spent a four-four four is I was talking to my friend who biked from Seattle down here to San Francisco and he said the biggest difference between on that ride versus all his other rides was after the first day and your legs are sore and you can't believe you got up again the second day is you stop thinking about like the destination and you start thinking about the next few hills in the end of the day and you're saying wow like all of a sudden I don't think like all right one more hill in my legs will like give out I can't like go any further like well I know I got to get to San Francisco because if I stop like I'm in the middle of you know Oregon and I have a bike like what am I going to do and day in day out and that that mindset change something clicked I think for me and for you as well we're all of a sudden you're like all right like let's get to the next hill let's keep fighting let's find other people to bring on our crazy bike ride and who knows where San Francisco is you know it might be 10 years out and that's fine you know because biking is awesome absolutely and I think really there's no better time to start than now whether you want to join a startup or whether you want to do something yourself I think the best thing you can do is to start like I remember and I'll tell this story just because we're at San Francisco and Tina's here like I remember studying a broad and applying for the Mayfield Fellows program and I was so empty about learning how to make like websites that I made this thing called the tree list which was a terrible knockoff of Craigslist for Stanford and I was studying abroad in this little like room and I was like making the website in that room with no internet connectivity but in order to push code out I had to like go in the snow like it was snowing in Florence at the time across to the library that like just eaked out free Wi-Fi out of their window and push the code and it went up and I still remember like people started using it at Stanford and I was over there in Italy and this there was this like awesome connection with people and what I realized then was like just the hunger to like build stuff and put it in front of people is really valuable as you get moving an entrepreneurship and there's no reason you can't start right if you're studying abroad there's no reason you can't start if you know nothing about HTML CSS JavaScript there's no reason you can't pick up a book right if you're doing something outside of consumer internet there's no reason you can't start thinking about the idea and interviewing people and meeting the people that are going to help that happen over time because in the end it is a long slog right and what we found is the thing that really has helped us along the way are those little skills we picked up by hacking on the side so if you're interested in working on Instagram please do email us jobs at instagram.com we're looking for very talented people thank you very much everyone amazing I'm so proud of you guys you're so incredible to have you here when you got that card made to a thumbs of the audience and I told them look ahead a few years you guys are up there so I was asking can you I'm going to open this up to the audience in a second but I'm going to start out with can you tell us a little bit about your working relationship how who does what and has it always worked well how there have been tensions that have come up tell us a little bit about how that works and then I'm going to let you monitor questions. right I think of all the co-founders I know we probably get along best I've definitely talked to co-founder pairs that like don't get along at all I think what you need to do in a co-founder relationship is like not necessarily decide who's good at what but realize that like like any relationship right your goal is to like figure out the other person and figure out your relationship with them and through I think the last year or so we've really gotten into the groove of like you know we own different parts of the day to day stuff but at the same time we use each other to kind of like bounce ideas off like you do a lot of like the iPhone client stuff I do a lot of the CEO stuff of like accounting etc and do a lot of you know the backend coding as well but what happens is because we both have our own specialties but also overlap into each other's areas it really provides for this nice like you know relationship where you can bounce ideas off other people or get that like person to say are you sure you want to do it that way and what has happened is it's that yin yang relationship that I really think has helped us succeed it's hard to screen for ahead of time like we knew each other we barely knew each other so like we figured out that we could work together on a technical level by just getting together over a bunch of weekends and saying like let's build like a little simple Facebook game like let's it's gonna take a few hours let's build it together or whatever and that's you know you can get sort of going but a lot of it ends up being like what's your gut feel do your reference checks you know it's a nice thing to bet you thank you it was like you know it's like let's get going and let's see how it goes yeah it's it's an interesting it's hard because I think no matter who you work with like you have to figure out and this is actually more even for employees it's like your relationship is going to be a long one right and if you're in the entrepreneurship world like your best ally is sitting next to you and you need to make sure to like cherish that relationship because that's what gets you to the next level the biggest source of strif I found is when there's a disconnect between expectations as to like what you're building in like how long you want to be building it for and it's important to both of us that like I can't imagine doing anything else in the world like I love doing this and I want to be doing this for a really long time and like I love what I do I love coming in and like if people are like oh like six months to year then like cash out that's going to be a really difficult let's hear both feeling that way in it's like you know then that's a different relationship but like if you're in it for the long call make sure that the people you know as well it's a tough conversation and you might like lose a co-founder that way like early on like before you start but it's much better I think than going on and then six months later like having that really really like worn down relationship absolutely I'm looking back by the way just to finish off the thought like I can't imagine starting company without a co-founder I said that to you today like it's such a hard job to get off the ground it's such a hard job to like recruit people to deal with whether it's investors or press having someone across the way to be like man this really bummed me out or how do you think about this like I actually think that's one of the things that has kept us going in you know four or five a.m. when we're fixing the servers or dealing with some issue it's it's been fantastic absolutely any questions from the audience? yeah so how did you find your first engineer and how do you get the the question was how do we find our first engineer? we were really lucky so we were at dock patch jobs just incubator run by Polaris Ventures up in San Francisco and we happened to be sitting at the same like table pod as this guy Shane who was an engineer at the time was working with a different startup and doing some freelance stuff but you know he taught Kevin like the initial steps of iPhone coding so like we knew not only that he know his stuff but also he was very good at communicating information which is really important like our bar for hiring is like can they teach us a bunch of stuff because A we're not we weren't trained in computer science like we were not like by any means totally knowledgeable about everything we're building so who can rebuild that can teach us so the fact that he had both of those assets was really important and it took probably three months after launch and about you know we were nine months into the startup or eight months into the startup process at that point so while we built all the for view on ourselves you said you had a lot of users 24 hours of July how did it happen where when when did we come from so the question was we said that 24 hours after we launched we had a lot of users sign up it where did they come from how did it happen we get asked this question a lot it is not clear that we have the exact answer but we have some hunches I think the biggest thing overall was that as we were prototyping and testing the application we gave it to a few folks that we knew had very large like Twitter followings and not necessarily very large Twitter followings overall but very large followings in a certain community specifically like the designer community like the online web designer community because we felt like photography and the visual element of what we were doing really resonated with those people and we gave it to those specific people that had lots of following I remember going down the list of like the top followed people and just emailing them and all of them were like yeah we'll try it out and because they shared to Twitter I think it created this tension of like when is this thing launching when do I get to play with it and that's the day when we actually launched I think it like had that springboard effect right I don't think that works for every startup and I'm not sure that I would do it that way if I did another startup but I think that's certainly contributed to part of it the thing I think that above all else makes product spread is when they're useful and they're usable right like it turns out when you make really nice stuff that people love like they will spread it to their friends because they'll rave about it they'll tell people about it and that's what I think at the end of the day has allowed us to grow very quickly is that people get really excited about sharing photos and they really get excited about applying filters to them and it's cool to show your friend that you do this thing that has caused above all else I think us to spread very quickly the big part we had a lot of really great press on day one and a lot of that came from the fact that we just took all the PR upon ourselves kind of handled most of it which was like not like going through a PR agency and like that becomes important as you scale out and you have like more targeted things you need to do but two founders telling their story is a really compelling like pitch to a to a reporter there was so excited to actually talk to a founder versus some agency they were like really wait you guys work on this and it was this freshness that I think allowed them to get really excited about it totally yes in terms of like staying lean and hiring and recruiting how do you balance uh I'm sure you guys get a lot of people who want to work for Instagram right how do you balance basically you know really smart really talented people who fit in well with your team and hiring you know like growing that team versus staying like as small as possible like you know what's the kind of trade-offs that you think about like you're right so the question is what are the trade-offs between growing the team and staying as small as possible um I don't think we ever want to stay as small as possible I think there's a certain stage where uh are let me put it another way as you're growing your company there's this like natural height for something that age it's just like you know humans there's a natural height for a three year old and you can be within a certain range I think the wrong thing to do is be six feet tall as a one year old hire up 40 people and decide you're gonna attack some problem really quickly and you haven't even launched yet like I think at the same time when you are you know six months old and you have two people and you're proving out an idea just to get traction that's great because it turns out there's not a lot of disagreement we're seeing there we can look across the table and make split second decisions and move very very quickly but at a certain point you have to start refining your idea and scaling it out and at a certain point you know the fact that you only have four people becomes the bottleneck so I think what my answer would be is don't shoot for one or the other shoot for the natural height of your company shoot for where you are in the in the life cycle of your company that makes sense yeah through that anything else back yeah that's a great question so the question was how do we think about work life balance I think we should have a two-part answer because I bet we think about it similarly but um but also very differently um so we both have girlfriends which I think naturally means that like we cannot work all the time because they get very angry at us if we do that um at the same time it's it's great and um I end up uh deciding that there's a way to work hard it doesn't mean you need to work long I think that you can burn yourself out really easily if every single night you're up to 3 a.m. and you sleep three hours I don't function if I don't sleep for like eight hours which is terrible for an entrepreneur um at the same time when you do work like not having tech crunch open on the side not having IRC channels open on the side like I make a really concerted effort for when I am working to work on the most important things so that I can go home at the end of the day and spend time with my girlfriend spend time with my friends on the weekend and I think that's helped us out which is that focus of working on the most important stuff means that we create the work life balance what happens is when you know you don't have that balance things start to go out of your life and I think that like that causes you to not work as well at work so I think everyone has again their natural height right they have their natural balance um but it's never like a question of when I'm working or when I'm playing it's like work is 24-7 for me but like you know it might be in the form of going to an art gallery and being inspired by seeing some filter on a photo there right it might be you know having conversations with my friends at a bar and watching them use Instagram in an interesting way um I'd never consider there to be boundaries it kind of mixes in but because I love what I'm doing that just it's natural yeah a lot of it that resonates with me as well the the the first couple months are particularly difficult especially as you're getting traction and things go a little bit crazy but just things have said a lot and you find ways of of making your day be something that you're excited about every morning so you know I live about 18-minute bike ride from the office and I make sure to bike to work and back every day so at least I'm getting some exercise in there and then like you feel a little energized by the time you get into the office and it you know it does mean that like I used to read a lot of novels and I haven't really read a novel in a long time so there's things you obviously have to give up but I think there's still a way of doing it especially around like being smart about how you use your weekends so like if you're putting in hours in the weekend making sure you still have time to go out and meet up with your friends or you know getting together you know there's a place called coffee bar in San Francisco which is this great coffee shop with a lot of like open Wi-Fi and seating and you can have a perfectly nice afternoon like enjoying your coffee working on stuff but like being social with your friends who maybe are also working on maybe their own side projects for example and you you find those slots in there and yeah I'd say there's things you need to give up and there's distractions you need to absolutely give up and you need to make sure that like your nine ten hours in the office are just straight office one thing that we've I've given up in my life was like long lunches I used to like grab lunch and then like sit down and talk for an hour and like how we get lunch and we eat and then we get working and that's fine because I know that that means that like that hour is an hour that's going to pay me back later in that day when I can you know go home you know an hour earlier right here in the middle I don't care but I'd like you to tell Mike that forget what you signed that you now on 90% of the company and he gets ten I like like to respond I don't think it's about it's interesting like the whole equity split always is really interesting to me with startups like I think everyone has like a different yeah a different prescription for like how you should split up one of I think it's your friend I can't remember his name is like you should never have equal share that's terrible and then I hear you should have equal share I think like the startup equity split is one of these things that has always befuddled me like I don't quite understand it I don't quite understand why people split it the way they do it turns out that like if you work hard like good things happen and I think that like that's really the basis of it you should just try to be as fair as possible for the stage of the company you're at and the work people have put in before or after and make sure to treat your employees really well and like when you bring on people and you have a large you know option pool make sure to be generous because those are the people that are going to stay with you until like 4 a.m. Absolutely. I didn't hear a microphone. Oh at least it's fun. So you need to all about like managing like how much uncertainty are you dealing with with every step you know and like 90-10 would be a stretch but like for example like I was still like working and I said job where Kevin was like I am going to quit my job and raise money and like live maybe on savings and was ready to like you know get money from his folks back east or something if it like fell through you know that's like crazy uncertainty when I joined I was like we have some money we have no idea what we're building all right like that's crazy uncertainty like after we launch like this thing has legs but we need to work on it for a really long time to make it successful and it could still you know you know be hurt by all these different factors that's still uncertainty you're always dealing with that and I think equity splits are often you know should probably be we are a flexion of those different factors and what kind of uncertainty and what kind of questions you're you're answering at every level. I do feel like just anecdotally that like there's this weird dynamic where like you know founders at a certain point just get orders of magnitude then like the first few employees and that's really a function of taking money from venture and having an option pool and having to budget for hiring your first like say 20 people so the way these days to make lots of money in terms of equity in a startup is to join very early on and it really is a risk-or-error award ratio or there's a relationship there and I'm not sure I'm excited about that that like you know relationship but I think that as you'll see people have to raise less and less to get started and that means you know early employees are getting better and better deals. I'll add myth number nine based on that also which is that like doing a startup is one of the riskiest things you can do like it really is not if you're in the valley if you're connected to Stanford if you have good friends like the worst thing that can happen like it's sure there's opportunity cost you'll be making less money than at a large company those things are all true but month one of experience for me was worth like the two years of work experience I'd had before and you will leave so much richer no matter how badly your startup flops or how well it goes I completely agree I still don't make as much money as I was offered out of school the job I didn't take and I've made decisions along the way that have taken less money along the way because I love what I'm doing and hopefully that pays back someday but I don't care because I do what I love and doesn't cost a lot to do that yeah green shirt I'm sure you said something about things not ideas I'm not an honest yeah events the ground there are a number of possible things and it could be the filters it could be the sharing could be the simplicity just from your mouth I'd be interested to hear what you guys think the themes are and do they all need to be there to have this successful product or is it just was a net exploration to me like when I set up when I graduated from college I had like two requirements for whatever job or startup whatever I was going to do one of them was be a company or a service or something that help people communicate because that just excites me and I love seeing those connections and I think that almost you know I would imagine everything I do for the rest of my career has some element of that component you know the other one was it's less relevant I guess to Instagram which is it would help you teach or learn something to be like educational in some way in some way like we actually find our power users will create these little following communities where they're like I will show you how to take more interesting photos so like there is some of that happening on Instagram but that's just a consequence of a of a larger site so there's me that communication particularly between like people who may not know each other before they even sign up for your service is a huge part of what I'm interested in and something to get man get gets manifested in Instagram in a serious way I photography it's interesting I remember sitting now with and I won't name names a founder of a pretty successful startup in in Palo Alto when I was thinking of leaving my job at Google and saying I think I want to start a photography startup this was like way before bourbon and I still remember him being like photography like images like photos on the internet like hasn't that been done like a million times that's not interesting go do this other thing I remember walking away feeling kind of bummed out that like my passion for like photos was somehow like not going to get married with something I did in the future online and I feel like looking back and retrospect like I'm so glad we're doing what we're doing now because that's like exactly like if you ask my friends in high school what kind of startup I'd be doing you know 15 years from then like they would be like oh yeah I'll be working on a photo thing like for sure and I'm glad we came back to that but I didn't realize it at the time but now that we're doing it I'm like duh like of course we wanted to do something in photos so having that passion and following that theme and realizing like what the things are that make you really excited I think just like keeps you up a little later at night makes you drive through the hard times it's not necessary but it sure does help yeah I think we're both a new resolve disagreements fist fights no so how do we resolve disagreements it's interesting we don't really disagree very much that's a good question how do we I was thinking somebody asked me this question the other week and I was like we it's not that we don't disagree it's that often the I think we're both hyper aware that neither like for example like we're debating a user interface decision yesterday and we sat down and I had an opinion and he had an opinion and we came up with something completely different and it's just like the salute I think we're both hyper aware that whatever we had in our heads is going to get improved the second we start talking to somebody else about it particularly each other because we have a really good um report and then at the end you say wow like we actually decided not to build this feature at all we're building something different um and we can agree on that um terms of stalemates I don't know if we've really had ask us in a year exactly um but in all honesty I think like disagreements are interesting because I think often people like put their personalities in the way or they they get really like you know attached to an idea but every single thing we talk about is always a discussion like I think that like someone asked before like you know do we get along it's like it turns out you can get along really well with someone if you just discuss lots of stuff right um also it's nice to find a co-founder who like shares a lot of the same values you have and I think like we're very aligned on a lot of like how we want to build the company like the type of people we want to bring in the type of work we want to do um it's just helped us a lot but that's not the case in every single co-founder relationship and some that I know disagree all the time and get in screaming matches but they go home and they shake hands and they say whatever like you know bygones be bygones and they still get along right um I think it's about finding your natural like relationship with you know your team not just your co-founder yeah yep go for it so I'm a founder of a pre-funding startup and I wanted your perspective on this one uh I'm confused I'm confused I'm conflicted just to whether I should launch the product and then look for the funding or whether I should try to get the funding first launch it because chances are the whole thing might just take wildly and maybe I may not have the funds to fund that particular growth that might be there and I'm conflicted as to when is the time when I should go and fund a major investors and get the funding the question was uh when's the right time to go for funding that um there's this conflict between wanting to go early um so that when you start growing quickly you can like manage that growth and then um on the opposite end do you you know wait until you start growing and then go raise money honestly like if you're growing as quickly as you say like there are startups that just open credit cards I'm trying to think of the like startups that do that they like open credit cards to pay for like the week where they're growing like crazy money will come if you're growing that quickly like it isn't like yeah there's there's so much money out there like chasing bad ideas that a good idea will get funding um and I think that I wouldn't worry about the best case scenario I would worry about the the average case scenario so I think what I learned was that it was really powerful to get a prototype out there and prove that this was something I wanted to work on more um or that like you know users would use and that just like resonated with a lot of the the angels and vcs that we talked to um my advice and not knowing what you're working on would be to at least get it in front of many users first not necessarily public but like put it in front of real people um and prove at the point um and and always be making the relationships that will help you raise the capital to do what you need to do yeah if you have the connections and the introductions to say like I'm not pitching you right now but here's what I've been working on like I'd love your early situa people are busy so it's not it's always not always possible but the to the extent that you can build those relationships like that one cocktail party ended up being super pivotal when it can actually raise how many more questions can we take just one more just one more okay the special one how about you right there in the middle thank you you are how in terms of principle when you go step there and schedule I don't know if you sit down and schedule timeout how much time do you schedule to kind of give up you all features in anticipation of competition and how much time do you have kind of before or before we go to the future development and how do you how do you make that that kind of investment into um I think it's an area we both matured in I think early on like as you built something you've put your baby out into the world and like people are using it or criticizing it or loving it um and then you like every week something pops up that is you know at least nominally competitive with us um and I think at first at least I personally like I would look at them be like oh man they have this one thing that's like better than ours like it's gonna like take off and like you shouldn't be completely oblivious to it but there was a moment about three or four months in where we're like we looked at each other and we're like the only way we got to where we are today is by being ourselves and putting in the work that we want to do and building the product we want to build and then that clicked that changes the way we looked at competition it's like you not oblivious of it um and it's not good to just be like oh I'm in my own world and like nothing else is happening out there but build the product that you're in love with and I think good things will follow and ultimately you'll see like the extent of your vision versus like trying to cobble together because what I've found like in products that end up um like borrowing from other things is that you end up with this like franken product where like nothing feels sincere the biggest learning for me was we were like looking at a sign-up form for a particular startup and we're like wow like I wonder why they met all these decisions and months later we met their founder and they're like oh we did that in an afternoon it's totally wrong like I can't believe we shipped that and so the things that you think are like really well thought out in other startups might have been like off the cuff last minute thoughts and same for us like some people copy like things in our app that like I'm like oh like we're probably changing that next week so that's a but at the same time I think it's you know it's really easy to get cut up in competition early on especially in like the press like I think I worried a lot about like oh like who's announcing funding and when and like just doesn't matter like it spends a lot of your cycles worrying about this meta stuff what matters is building great products and delighting people um and I would just encourage you to focus on building great products thank you so much you have been listening to the draper Fisher-Jovison entrepreneurial thought leader series
