 You were listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at edcorner.stanford.edu. I am so pleased to introduce our two speakers today. We have Ron Cawai and Mike Naples. One is a legend in angel investing in the valley. In fact, he is invested in over 500 startups in his career and 50 in this last year alone. And he has incredible stories to tell and great insights that he will share with us. Mike Naples is a younger and newer angel investor with an incredible track record. He was the founder of Motive. Is that correct? That's right. And which he took from the early beginning in the startup phase all the way through selling it for $100 million. And then went off and became an angel investor. Well, actually still public. It's still public. And an IPO. Yeah. Okay, so great. Well, we're going to get some really great insights from these guys. And I told them that if we have some disagreements, that would be fine. It's great to get different points of view. So my first question to you is, what actually is an angel investor? Who wants to take that one? One who loves to take a lot of risk. And it's an individual, hopefully, who has some industry expertise who invests 50 or 100K in raw startups. The term got derived in the 30s when people invested in Hollywood movies down in LA and they got the nickname angels. And that just carried its way on into high tech. But it's individuals who invest in early, early stage companies. So why would I want someone to be an angel investor in my venture? Why would any of you folks in this room want to engage an angel investor in their startup? I think there's really three or four main reasons. The first is just money, which is the obvious one. I think there's also contacts. And Ron in particular, I think, knows tons of people all throughout the industry. And I'm doing my best to keep up. I think perspective, the good angels have had some type of accomplishment in business before. And so usually they've seen a lot of the near death experiences that a startup will face. They know when it's time to be calm versus when it's time to have an incredible sense of urgency. And then I think the other important thing is that the good angels will provide a broader range of exit options. And so that's a subtle point we may want to talk about some later. But raising small amounts of money and keeping burn rates low provides the entrepreneur with a wide variety of possible good outcomes. And so I think that's important as well. So let's imagine someone in this room is starting some new venture and they're doing it in their dorm room. And they want to get some angel funding to get a little bit of escape velocity. How would they pick someone? How do you know someone's a good angel investor? What are the things I should think about or they should think about? Well mainly, you know, an angel who will add value and an angel that you can get access to. You know, I think the groups here have access to a lot of angels because you have forums like this. But what you want to do is get some in-road to an angel so that you can send some kind of an executive summary to them and get a meeting set up. And then hopefully get the angels to fund you and then introduce you to the VCs as your next step in maturing the company. So when someone comes to you with an idea, what are you looking for? What are the key metrics? I'm sure you've got some sort of list that you go down at least in your mind as you're evaluating these opportunities. Yeah, there's two or four things I look for and I should clarify, there's a slight difference between how Ron and I approach things. So, you know, my belief is that there's a new kind of angel emerging that really sits in the gap between angels and VCs. And so, Ron described an investing strategy of investing, you know, say $50 to $100,000 in a company. Typically the venture capitalists will want to fund a company in the multiple millions of dollars, usually north of five. And so, I look for entrepreneurs who want to raise more like a million dollars. And so very often, I'll help by contributing something like $500,000 and then Ron and I and other angels will work together to fill out the rest of the round. And so, you know, I think that's a key thing that I think entrepreneurs also need to look for is just how much money they need to raise to get to the next level. But to answer your question more directly, I guess a pet peeve of mine is that a lot of entrepreneurs approach me with just an idea. And ideas are pretty cheap. And so, you know, we're now in an era where the cost of experimentation is very low. And so, if you come as an entrepreneur to an investor and you haven't run a single experiment, haven't done anything to test the market viability of the product, it reflects a lack of conviction on the entrepreneur's part. And if an entrepreneur doesn't have enough conviction to really test their idea in a low-cost, low-burn, leverage-efficient way, why should they propose that I should be excited? And so, you know, the one piece of advice that I would have, the one common mistake I think people make is that they want to have lunch and just talk about ideas. And, you know, heck of I know if it's a good idea. I'm not a customer. And, you know, my opinion is irrelevant if I'm not going to pay for the product, only customers matter in terms of evaluating whether it's a good idea. Now, it's interesting. You mentioned before that you often work together. Do angel investors tend to work in consortiums and each say, okay, I'll put in a little bit. You put in a little bit and you essentially build a bigger pool that way? Yeah, the average angel round is a half a million to a million, let's say. So if I put in my appetite is 50 to 100,000. So, you know, I'm just raising a half a million. If I'm the lead angel, I'll go syndicate the rest of the half a million or a million. So we do know all the act of angels that we think add value and we invite them in once we decide we're going to invest. Yeah, I like to use the metaphor. How many people have ever seen the movie, Ocean's Eleven? Okay, so a lot of people. So it's a current movie. So in Ocean's Eleven in order to rob the Bellagio Hotel, you had the guy that was the acrobat. You had the safe picker and the guy that could blow up things and the guy who could hatch the whole plan. And so what I like to say to an entrepreneur is that we want to find an Ocean's Eleven syndicate of angels. And so for example, if we're investing in a social networking company, you want people like Reid Hoffman, who's an awesome at viral marketing and engineering, if you're investing in a targeted advertising company, there might be people like, say, Regif Muttwani, who are incredibly valuable from his experience at Google. And so, you know, the idea is to ask the entrepreneur, what would be your dream team of angels? If you could pick any and wave a magic wand and then try to get that team excited about the project and come in on it together as an Ocean's Eleven team. And then we go off our separate ways and help the company. Well, so that's a great segue into the next question, which is, well, what do you do for the company? I mean, if you end up investing in this new venture that this whole class, we've all brought to you with this idea, what are you going to do for us? Well, number one, write a check, which is crucial. And then find out what the needs of the company are and it's always going to be people needs. So if the company needs Biz Dev help, then we would find someone to either go work full time in Biz Dev or someone to advise the company in Biz Dev. If the company needs more engineering talent, then we'll introduce the company to engineering talent. So in the early stages, it's staffing up and getting the company such that it has a successful prototype that it's testing in the marketplace, it is getting some metrics and then we'll go introduce the company to the VCs on Sand Hill Road. If it's a capital intensive company, if not, what's starting to happen now is the angels will do the next round of financing because it doesn't cost a lot of money to build a company today. You can do your angel round for a half a million to a million and then do the next round for a couple of million. If the product is taking off, you may not need to raise VC funding. I think you're probably talking a lot about Web 2.0 ventures that can be shown as opposed to capital intensive ventures where we've got to build a plant or have things manufactured. Right. I guess just another observation. When you're a startup, it's like you're a fast-moving car and you don't have time to stop. You're going through a busy traffic city. Part of my job is just to help all the lights turn green at the right time. You never know what that's going to be. You never know if that's biz dev, you never know if that's helping with recruiting. You just never really know. You're always trying to work with the entrepreneur and to anticipate. That's why you want to have a broad-based ocean 11 team because if you have the right mix of people, there's always somebody who can help that light turn green. That's the right time when the cars flying through the intersection at right next speed. In an environment where speed is everything, the company that just has the one extra green light maybe gets the finish line just a little bit faster. That's the difference between winning and losing. I'm going to guess that there are really different levels of engagement that you have with different ventures that some, you're much more, you know, every day you're on the phone 20 times with the CEO and other ones you kind of leave alone for a while. You could tell a little bit about even some stories or something that would help us understand what it would mean to actually have you involved in different type of ventures. Well it depends on the entrepreneur. If it's an entrepreneur that does not have a lot of experience, then there's going to be a lot of front-end work. I actually gauge that into whether or not I'm going to invest. Because if you're an individual angel, you can't have five entrepreneurs without a lot of experience that you invest in in the space of three or four months. There's no way you'll do them service. So I actually look for a mix of entrepreneurs and I make sure that at any one point in time only have one that doesn't have a lot of experience. That has to be a pretty special entrepreneur where I have really good chemistry with that entrepreneur and I'm willing to put in the extra effort that it's going to take, to take that company to the next step and then you find other mentors in the angel group who can spend more time with that particular company as well. In general, I find that the failure mode I try to avoid most is co-dependencies. If the entrepreneur can't live without me, chances are it's not a good investment for me. I'd rather help somebody run up the score than figure it out. And at the same time, the corollary to that is never invest in your own vision. So you see a company in the entrepreneur thinks it's one thing and you think, gosh, if I was running it, I'd make it into something different and cooler. In the end, they're going to do what their vision is. And so you've got to get really comfortable with that and be in a position to help be a multiplier effect on that rather than a cause of it. When you talked about having a portfolio of experience of the launchpreneur, you know, some who were sort of raw and some who are really experienced, do you have other approaches in terms of building the portfolio, in terms of technology, or the amount of money that need? I mean, how do you build the portfolio of investments? Well, I know that I'm very focused on internet market segments that include video. I think the monetization of video on the internet is a multi-billion dollar opportunity that's growing at thousands of percent a year. I still think it's very early days for search. There's going to be lots of advancement in search technology. Behavioral targeting, so delivering better advertising results. Two people while they're searching is a huge market segment. And then I also like the gaming segment. So if an entrepreneur comes to me and it's one of those four segments, automatically, you know, it goes way up the Richter scale, then, you know, we read the executive summary. See if we like that, then we have a phone conversation, and then we have a meeting. So the face-to-face meetings get more and more rare because the amount of deal flow is so high. I see five new deals a day. You can imagine I have to reject three a day, or there's no way of keeping up. So two a day kind of go down the assembly line. And by the time we set up a meeting with the company, you know, we're pretty impressed already with what we see. So I just follow, what's the nutrition rate? I want to hear the funnel. How many do you get? How many do you read? How many do you see? How many do you fund? How many are successful? So. OK, come on. Inquiring my, you know. So we see five a day. And I have another fund, an angel fund, life mics that helps me called baseline. So please don't think that I do all this myself. baseline has three people who basically rely and process all my deal flow because it's so massive. Because I've invested in 500 companies, think about 500 companies. You have five people on the management team, five people on the board of directors. That's 10 people per company times 500. There's 5,000 people in Silicon Valley who, when they go to start a company, they go, oh, why don't we go back to the guy that did our last one? So that's why the deal flow is so massive. My deal flow is actually very high quality. These are all people I know. I triage the deal source right away. And that's a, you know, in Mark Andreessen sends me a deal which he does like once a month. That's a high quality deal because he's already passed his screen. He wants to see if I want to co-invest with him. So back to the question. So five a day are coming in. We try and get rid of 2 1 1 2 1 2 3 right at the get go. And then the other two to three will go on this assembly line where myself and the baseline folks will evaluate the executive summary. That's why you have to have a great executive summary with a great elevator pitch. If you can't communicate via writing exactly what this company is doing, you're not going to get through the system. So if we like the elevator pitch, you know, we'll kind of vote on that. One of the folks from baseline or myself will call the entrepreneur, chat about the company. We'll probably be doing a couple of backdoor references. I'm huge on backdoor references. Oh, this guy came out of Yahoo. I'm going to go call some of my buddies at Yahoo and see if this person is well respected. We do all that in the background. And then if it passes that stage, then we'll take a meeting and then we'll invest. So let's say we do one investment a month. So five times 30, we see 150 deals a month. One gets a check written. So that's kind of the funnel. Right now in the last two years, I've invested in 125 companies. There'll be two or three rock stars in there. Facebook's definitely going to be one. Dig would be another one. That's one that Mike and I are in together. But basically a third to third to third. A third of the companies are going out of business. When you start a company, understand a third of them go out of business. I do not get upset when companies go out of business. I feel sorry for the entrepreneur. I hope they learn from their mistakes. But it is a fact of life. This is a risky business. And then a third of them usually return the money back. So I had an entrepreneur yesterday saying, oh, this is awful. I'm going to sell my company. I'm only going to give the investors their money back. I said, what are you talking about? You're already above the law of averages. You're in the second quartile of success. And then about a third of the companies will return three to five to 10x your money back. Those that top third pays for the other two thirds. So lots of mistakes get made in venture. That's what it's all about. It's about taking risk. But in the end, that top third, if you have one hit, it's definitely a hits business. If you have one hit per investment cycle, and I've been very fortunate to have one hit per cycle, it pays for the entire rest of the portfolio. So you really are looking for the hits. So would you invest in someone who had a failure who comes back to you again? Of course. I had a recent forward fumble in that regard. So the first investment I ever made when I moved out here was in a company called ODO, which is a podcast in company start by Evan Williams, who formerly started blogger. And I thought podcasting would be huge. Evan Williams is awesome. I'm going to fund this company. So the week after we fund it, Apple announces podcasting on items. We're like, that's not a good start. And so about six to nine months later, Evan says, hey, look, we don't have a real business here. And I'm just going to give you your money back. And I said, look, I sort of know how the rules work. If you invest, it doesn't work out. I don't get my money back. That's how it goes. He goes, no. I think I raised too much. I'm going to give you 100% of your money back. So I said, hey, well, that's just an amazing gesture. And so I said, I'll tell you what, I don't want your money back. Just whatever you do next, I don't care what it is. Just put it in that. And he goes, well, I got this side project that I'm excited about called Twitter. And so I said, well, OK, Twitter, that sounds good. So when you decide you're going to raise money for Twitter, I'm in. I just want to put the same amount in. I mean, that's probably also a good lesson about just having things work out a good term for garlics. It's not the entrepreneur that failed. It's the business that failed. And in life, you win some, you lose some. And the trick is to fail aggressively, or fail gracefully, and sometimes even aggressively, if the idea is it working. And to not have everybody take it personally, not leave any regrets on the playing field. But not everything is going to work in life. Now, some companies do fail because the entrepreneur got bullheaded. Didn't take the M&A offer three months later, ran out of money. The company goes out of business. That's an entrepreneur I will not invest in again. So but from investing in entrepreneurs like that, you try and learn your lessons. And I try and pick entrepreneurs now that I have really good chemistry with. And who are very, very flexible, who understand that their business is going to morph and be completely different from what they talked and were so passionate about in the first meeting. The entrepreneurs that fail are usually the ones that don't understand that the business is supposed to morph. You're supposed to admit that, hey, that didn't work. Let's go change it. Let's adjust the business and find a market that's receptive to the product. And so those are the key traits that are so important. So how long do you give, of course? I mean, let's sort of say you've given us all money. All of us in this room have come to you with an idea. And we've got some skin in the game. We've got a prototype. We've got some customers. You guys get together and give us some money. How long a runway do you give us? Would you give us enough money, burn right for the next six months, the next year? At what point do you evaluate again? Maybe you could kind of walk us through that. Well, I wish I had a really good answer to that. Because originally the way I approached it was, whenever I back a company, it starts out as a B. So everybody in the portfolio gets a B grade. And in order to be an A, you have to do something spectacular unexpected. And in order to get a C, you have to basically repeatedly screw up. And so I thought, OK, we'll always know who the A, Bs, and Cs are. So when it's time to follow on, if somebody's a C, then I really need to ask myself the hard question, why do I want to double down on this losing thing? Why shouldn't I be helping the A players run up the score? And so but some companies, what I've learned is that if you keep your burn low, and I think that this is a really important lesson, not just about financing, but just in general, companies that have low burn rates by themselves hugely better probabilities of getting lucky over time. And so there have been companies I've invested in where it seemed like we were going out of business in a month. And just because we were on such a low burn rate, we could try a lot of different things. And then lo and behold, one of them starts working. And you look at each other like, oh my god, it's working. And hey, let's do more of that. And then all of a sudden it goes for being a C to an A in the portfolio. And the $0 is coming in. And you're like, oh my gosh, we've got like profits at a business model. And the customers are growing. And the VCs are calling. So it's one of the things I've learned is you, and this is what's so hard, is you've got to be willing to not be too formulaic about when did you turn over another card. You've got to be willing to really talk to people that you trust and get their sense of perspective about, is it time to give up or is it time to be persistent? But I don't think there's any rule other than keep the burn low. But a million bucks better last over a year, roughly. But what Mike is saying, the lower the burn rate, the better. If you start with three people at the end of year one, it shouldn't be more than five or six. That's plenty. Companies are the most productive when they're less than 10 people. It's when you get over 10 people that people start looking over their shoulder. They're just not as productive. And so with that first million bucks, you want to have lean in main six people or so. And everybody works their ass off. And everybody accomplishes a lot for the company. Great. So did you want to say something? Well, yeah. And there is one observation that I think compliments low burn rates. And that is having a customer development strategy in addition to a product development strategy. And so most companies in Silicon Valley, when you ask them what their milestones are, they describe an engineering project. So it's alpha, beta, limited availability, first customer ship, general availability. There's a really good book written by Steve Blank, who started a company called Piphany, called the Four Steps of the Epiphany. And the basic thesis of the book is that companies should do customer development in parallel with product development. And that like it, product development, milestones, you have customer development, milestones around customer discovery, validation, creation, and company scaling. And the companies that pursue the path of low burn experimentation dramatically help the probabilities in their favor. And in this world of the LAMP stack, offshore labor, search engine marketing, there are reasons to be very optimistic that the cost of experimentation is asymptotically approaching zero. And in a world where you can experiment for near zero, you see companies like Slide releasing their products six times a day. That's the brave new world of entrepreneurship. Low burn experimentation, done a lot. Find out the winning answers, discard the losing answers, but don't scale until you know it works. Discover the business before you scale the business. So let's talk about the transition from angel investing to VC, right? That's got to be an interesting transition point. I have a couple of questions relating to this. One, having to do with, do you ever a situation where you get to the end? And you think it's a go, but you have difficult time getting that follow on investing from VC's? Or does it feel like once you're ready to push this off a cliff that there's definitely a parachute there to take it off or a rocket ship? Well, we have an email that we send to an exclusive list of all of our VC friends. So it's not a blanket mailing. It's VCs that I've had relationships with for 20 years. And we send them an email every six weeks, one's going out tonight. And we show them the companies in our portfolio that are entering a funding cycle in the next 30 days. So all the VCs scan that list and they send us an email saying, hey, introduce me to these three companies. There's probably 15 companies in the 30-day bucket in this email. It's the longest list we've ever had. And then we also tell the VCs, here's the companies who are going to be looking for funding in 60 to 90 days. If you want to look out to the next quarter, here's the companies that we know are going to be in a funding cycle. Our CEO has given us all this data. So we start telegraphing before the company's going to go out for funding to all of our VC friends, which is at least 50 VC firms, multiple partners per firm. And we telegraph that. We also go visit them all once a quarter and physically walk through and describe every company. Part of the responsibility of the angel, especially if they want to get any ROI, is to get that VC round or the next round done. So in some cases now, it's the minority. In some cases, the angels all get together and say, let's us put in some more money. But most of the time, after a year and you've got 400,000 in the bank, you want to start visiting VCs because it's going to take four months to get a term sheet, and almost six months before you get the check from the VC. What I'm about to say may be misinterpreted be somewhat controversial, but here goes. So fundamentally, I think great companies are the great entrepreneurs who've delivered on milestones have no trouble raising money. And so there are the occasional situations where you have the speed bump and the angels need to come in. But fundamentally, we try really hard to help entrepreneurs get the discipline of prove something dramatic when you still have six months left of cash. Because if you've accomplished something really impressive and you still have six months left of cash, you're sending a very strong signal to the VCs that you're a company and an entrepreneur of strength. And the best VCs want to work with those companies. The ones who go after the distressed companies, they're at best in the muddy middle of the bell curve. And they almost never really make any money. And so to me, that's the way to signal the very best VCs. And in the end, I've been very lucky with the companies and the follow-on rounds that they've had. And they've worked with some of the very best venture firms. But I don't give myself any credit for that. I know the VCs, but I know that in the end, they're evaluating the companies. And if the company can't stand on its own, there's not much I can do to save them. In the end, that's what they're buying. And that's what they're investing in. But by the way, we get a lot of referrals from the VC firms of companies that are so early stage that they'd rather the angels cultivate the company and then bring the company back to them in a year. Interesting. There's a lot of that that goes on. So one of the things that keeps bubbling around in my brain as you're talking is this incredibly rich ecosystem that we have here, where we've got the successful entrepreneurs with a great track record. We've got the angel investors. We have the VCs. We've got this, of course, we've got these talented students coming out of Stanford, who are feeding these companies. Is there any other place in the world that has this type of ecosystem and can it be replicated? Not even close. I'm really opinionated on this topic. Because we have five investments in New York that they're great companies, but they're more work than three companies in Silicon Valley. Because the ecosystem is not there. The cost of living here is awful. It's worse in New York. We cannot find CEOs who will work for less than 300,000 a year. That's terrible. The most a CEO should make a startup is 100K. So the ecosystem in Silicon Valley is so powerful. No one is going to come near us as far as I can see. I mean, these relationships where you have the lawyers, the attorneys, the bankers to give venture loans, the angels, it goes on and on and on. Just the attitude, the can-do attitude to Silicon Valley. It's nowhere close anywhere else. And every time I invest, even in LA, we have all kinds of problems where I say to the entrepreneur, if you just move to Silicon Valley, all this will be solved. Yeah, and that's actually borne out by the facts. So I was talking not long ago to somebody who invests in VC funds. And they've invested in hundreds of them over the last 30 years. And I said, well, what's the one thing you've learned? You said, draw a 25 mile radius around Stanford University. And 75% of all returns of the venture business have come from there. And that is a statistic, right? I mean, that's just an incredibly powerful argument about just the power of Silicon Valley and the ecosystem. And somewhere on the order of 90% plus have come from that plus 10 mile radius around Route 128 in Boston. So can you be in a situation where there are too many resources? Can there be too much money chasing deals? No way. They're camping. Then there's more, no, there's more competition. And the entrepreneur wins in that situation. The more choices entrepreneurs have, the better the ecosystem is. That's why Silicon Valley is so great. If I say no to an entrepreneur, the great news is there's another angel down the street that hopefully will do that deal. My goal is that every entrepreneur gets funded. Because I think there aren't enough entrepreneurs. The more entrepreneurs, the more Silicon Valley will thrive. I'm very glad. So you don't think that there's a right balance between deals and money? Well, I think that there's a risk that some companies get overfunded. Because there's a lot of, the venture firms have a lot of money right now. They've gone off and raised huge funds. And I believe that too much money in a startup is not only unnecessary. It's actually toxic. It causes you to pursue losing strategies for too long to the detriment of the winning strategies. And that actually, just like we talked about the statistic about the radius around Silicon Valley and Boston, if you look at all the truly great startups that have come out of Silicon Valley, they've been hyperfugal, Cisco, Google and the early days, Yahoo and the early days, Microsoft. I mean, the list goes on. I think that there is an inverse correlation between the amount of money and entrepreneur requires and the potential chaotic success of a startup. So I think that it's great that we have a richly developed ecosystem and that entrepreneurs have tons of opportunities. But it's like anything in life with infinite choice, you got to choose wisely. And if you choose to take too much money, you'll have three bin copy machines when one bin would do or maybe not even having a copy machine. You'll go higher goofy positions and VPs that don't do anything. And it go off on wacky initiatives that seem sexy, but that don't generate anything. And so it's incumbent on the successful entrepreneur to have your own internal voice that keeps you from accepting the lack of discipline that can often be foisted on you by somebody who wants to give you more money than you need. We have a lot of listeners to our podcast all over the world who are not in Silicon Valley. And if they want it. Get on the plane. I did what he said. Look at Mark Zuckerberg. Yeah. He's a guy who was sitting at Harvard. Facebook would still be successful today if he stayed at Harvard. No doubt about that. In my mind. But he had the sense to come out here and drag four of his roommates with him. Because he knew out here he would find more engineers, more biz dev people, and be able to build the ecosystem for Facebook faster. But let's imagine that everybody can't go on a plane and come to Silicon Valley. Don't start a company. No. OK. Let's imagine that you're in Latin America. And you're in Asia or Europe. And you say, I want to create a rich entrepreneurial environment. One would be the three things you would recommend. I mean, there's something you say, I want to at least try. Do you say set up an incubator? Do you say make sure that you bring in a bunch of investors? I mean, what would be the thing that you would recommend? Well, there are some good VCs in Europe. So I mean, if it was an entrepreneur who said I'm not moving. Skype didn't do too bad either. Yeah. But Skype was funded by Silicon Valley. But the Skype guys have actually founded a VC firm called Atomico. In England, which if it was an entrepreneur who wouldn't relocate, I'd say go talk to it to Atomico, go talk to Baldurton Capital, which is some former benchmark guys who I think really add value for entrepreneurs. Danny Rimer. Danny Rimer, index ventures is good. So yes, there's an ecosystem in Europe, but it's tiny compared to Silicon Valley. You have lawyers who screw up all the docs. The people just don't know the way these companies work, how they should be formed. So it's a special language. It's a special. And the other thing is part of the advantage that I think Silicon Valley's built over time. This is coming from a guy moved here from Austin for this reason. But the very best entrepreneurs in the world make enormous sacrifices to come here and build just awesome companies. And so if you think about some of the best companies in Silicon Valley that have ever been built, they weren't built by native Californians. Silicon Valley isn't so much of a place. It's an idea about what's possible and what kind of companies can be built. And people who gravitate to that set of ideas and that way of thinking and that culture locate here because in a hyper-brutally, savagely competitive world of startups, every advantage counts. All the lights are green here when they're yellow or red in other places. Okay, so let's switch gears. And I'm going to ask just a couple more questions that I'm going to open up to the audience and see what questions they have. Let's imagine that we all had one big huge hit on our venture that we came to you with and now we've got our pockets full of cash and we've decided that we want to become angel investors. What would we do to become good angel investors? It certainly doesn't just require the ability to write a check. What are the skills that are needed and if I wanted to do it, what would you teach me? Well hopefully build a rola decks where or have a rola decks, have a rola decks or build a rola decks that when the entrepreneur needs engineering help, you know where to direct that entrepreneur to find engineering help. Where to find business development help. Where to find recruiters. We just developed a whole roster of preferred service firms that we share with all of our entrepreneurs. Having those resources and knowing who to call is what's crucial. So if I was starting to angel invest, I would figure out, I'd pick a market segment, just one market segment and say, you know, I want to go invest in five video companies. I'm going to get really good at video so I can help each of these entrepreneurs develop a good video product. So I would invest in an area where I had some expertise, where I could add value. Interesting. So again, it's all about the network. Well, and I found it was really open. I mean, I owe Ron a huge debt of gratitude for this. I remember taking you to the Oasis one time, we first met and I just said, look, I just want to get involved in investing in startups and I'll help any way I can just give me a chance. And so it turned out I was excited about a company called Dig and Ron was meeting with them and he said, well, why don't you just come with me? And so just an incredible gesture. And after that, I didn't really, I tried not to be just a taker, right? After that, I introduced Ron to rock you an aggregate knowledge. And so the way I looked at it was, I was just going to try to help any way I could add value any way I could. I wasn't going to go in and say, hey, let me in in the club or any of that stuff. It was more, hey, just give me a chance, just one chance to add value, right? And so I found that it's an incredibly open group of people. And as long as they think you're not just a free rider trying to leach off of everything, that people want to work together. We're all sort of on the same team, fighting the same fights. You know, as long as you add value, I mean, Mike immediately started adding value at the beginning of the game. So Kevin Rostar to say, hey, that's a great guy you introduced me to. You know, it is about adding tangible value after you write the check. Very interesting. So I'm going to open it up. Now, here's a little word of advice. We don't have any microphones in the audience. So when you ask a question, please try to ask it really as short a question as possible because I'm going to repeat it so that our podcast audience will hear it. So first question. Mike, you mentioned that taking angel funding might give you a broader range of exit options to use the lab made on that way. So the question was, getting angel money gives you a broader range of exit options. What are they? Yeah. And so, and anybody who's interested, well, I may regret saying this, but anybody who's interested, send me an email to micitmapels.net. I've got some analysis on this. But I don't look at exit as a number. I look at it as a probability distribution curve. And so whenever I'm an entrepreneur and I raise money, there's a set of expectations I'm creating. So if I raise $5 million from a VC, the option to exit for $100 million or less is no longer available to me as an entrepreneur. So what I like to say to an entrepreneur is, let's go for the billion dollar exit. But before we go raise $5 million, this is really uncertain. We don't really know what's going to happen. Let's raise more like a million. And after 12 months, 18 months, we'll know if we want to go for the huge outcome, or maybe we'll have a little bit more information about a less attractive but still realistic exit. And so I think a lot of entrepreneurs like to raise money in such a way that they're always maximizing the width and attractiveness of that probability distribution curve. And so that's really the type of fundraising that I advocate. And we call that the dual track financing model. We're not saying that there's one predestined answer. We're saying that we're trying to improve the probabilities and the randomness to our advantage rather than be victims of it. Great. Yeah. Is there a temptation to raise a venture fund? Is there a temptation to raise a venture fund? I did that once. I have no temptation to raise a venture fund. So I did a ton of angel investing in the early 90s till 98, 99. I probably invested myself in 100 companies with Ben Rosano, who was then the chairman of Compact, even though he lived in New York. He loved investing out here. He has since retired. And that segwayed into starting two funds called Angel Investors LP, where we were managing like close to $200 million. And it didn't take me long to realize I didn't like managing other people's money. Even though our investors were great people, we never had any major conflict. I said, I don't want to invest for other people, rather just invest on my own account. So I think a lot of its personal preference. I don't want to be a fiduciary. Part of it also is when your fiduciary and the company starts to go south in your portfolio, when your fiduciary, you have a duty that company has two million in the bank to go get your two million out. Or make sure that two million is spent wisely when the company is on a downhill. When you're not a fiduciary like I am, I can say that company is on the downhill. I don't have to go to the entrepreneur and tell them I want my money back. I can just put it in the bottom third where I know it's going to end up and move on. So I'm actually a lot more productive because I'm not a fiduciary. Very interesting. So that's why I went back to Angel Investing in 2005. Do you want to repeat it? If I understood the question, angels evaluate entrepreneurs should entrepreneurs evaluate angels and do we encourage that? I would say I would encourage more of it. One of the who you choose to trust is one of the most important things to do well in your career, whether you're an entrepreneur or anything else. And it's amazing to me how many entrepreneurs they get caught up in the valuation and how fast they can get the round closed and a bunch of things that have nothing to do with, okay, I'm going to be in the fox hole with this person for the next five years. And bullets are going to be flying in all directions. What's that going to be like when we have our first near death experience? And so I would highly encourage entrepreneurs to really reference check in a lot of depth their angel investors. In fact, it's unsophisticated not to. Yeah, I couldn't agree more. But you are asking someone for money. But while you're asking them for money, and I can always tell the entrepreneur that's doing this, you can ask good questions to find out about the angel without insulting the angel or making the angel think that they're getting interviewed. But you should absolutely find out what, you know, if you think you have good chemistry with the angel, because as soon as things get rocky, you want that angel to be in the fox hole with you. And you should always be judging the chemistry that you have with your investor. Juliette. You mentioned the importance of specialized individuals or money centers. Whether that you'd want them or not before. And we've seen energy is very common in terms of type of investors. Where money doesn't really mind not being enough. Have you ever invested in energy and would you consider that what you think is the advantage of? So the question is, would you consider investing in the company? I understand that a lot of clean tech investments so far have not been of a capital efficient variety. And I don't believe that's going to be the case 100% of the time. And so I'm doing some proactive work right now. I can't talk about all the details, but that has to do exclusively with finding truly disruptive ideas. I think that if an idea is truly disruptive, it is always capital efficient. There's nothing wrong with non-disruptive ideas. It's just that they're more like big R&D projects that aren't lighting a forest fire with just one match. And I have to base my business on, let's light a forest fire with just one match. I do believe that there will be clean tech opportunities where those criteria can be applied. And in fact, I believe that that will be part of my competitive differentiations to find them. I'm getting a little worried about your lighting forest fires, your break into bangs. I'm just glad to for us. Yeah, maybe I'll stop with those. I don't do any green tech at all. Just the four market segments that I described. There's thousands of companies in each of those segments. And I'm having trouble with that, let alone picking up a new. Yeah, I mean, the way I like to look at is I specialize in capital efficiency. And I think that capital efficiency is a religion for how you can run a business. I'm happy to look at capital efficient ideas in any market sector. Most people focus on a sector, but I focus on a part of the capital ecosystem that I think is underserved. Any particular advice to younger entrepreneurs? So do you have any specific advice for young entrepreneurs? Well, if you have an idea, hopefully it's an idea that is satisfying a need that you encountered yourself, the YouTube test. Chad and Steve had a problem that they couldn't quickly efficiently upload their video to the internet. Why shouldn't that be dead simple? So they went and solved that. So if you find an opportunity that you think you can solve that millions of other people probably have the same issue, you probably have what we call a startup idea. And what I would do is then go find two or three other co-founders. It's very interesting. There's almost no companies with a single founder. And don't laugh. It was only a year ago that I realized this is pretty interesting dynamic. You don't really start a company yourself. You need to go collaborate with other people. So most of our startups have two or three people. If it's one person now, I like something weird here. But so I'd go find some other people that are of like mind who can get passionate about your idea and start developing a product. If you're in the business school, go find somebody in engineering to write the code. Which is the whole basis contest that happens here every year? Just one other thought. And this is maybe even a broader than just entrepreneurship advice. But I've told some of my friends on campus about this that a couple months ago I was at a wedding in Arizona and I'm walking through the airports really early in the morning. And the TSA guy goes to be, how are you doing? And I said, great, how are you doing? And he goes, what does it look like? I'm living the dream. And so, and it's sort of this epiphany came over me that, that if you go to Stanford University, you're in the rare position of privilege that you'll pretty much get to choose what you do in life. And that puts you in less than 1% of the world. And so I always like to say to people like the folks in this room, you have no excuse in life not to do things that you're passionate about. There are a lot of people who will never get to. And so if you're doing something that you're not passionate about, you're flunking a cosmic IQ test. And you know, you could learn that IQ test now or you could learn it when you're 40 and miserable in a job you don't like. But in the end, you know what your passion is. And with people and forces in the world try to prevent you from pursuing it, turn off the noise and the hype and believe yourself. Because so few people do. And it's just tragic. Anybody who comes out of this experience who's not doing something that they're excited about, it's a tragedy of their own making. It's just stupid. What's your vision of the future? What's the world like in 20 years? So what's the world like in 20 years? Wow. I actually don't think about that very often. I like to think about the next three to four years. So I don't think about 20 years. But in the next three to four years, the search that you have today on the internet, three years from now, the search that we see today will look like it's crap. Yeah, that's the advancements I think they're going to happen in search. The other space is, you know, internet video. Half the websites will be video only websites. You'll go through the website all with video. You know, what do you need text for? The trend that I get very excited about is just the continued inexorable trend towards capital efficiency enabled by abundance. And so when storage approaches zero, when processing power approaches zero, when everybody's on the internet, everybody has broadband, you get into this mode where you can run all kinds of experiments in all walks of life. And when you think about some of the big problems we have in the world, everything from clean water, everything from power to developing countries, all those things, when you think about the opportunity for a low burn experimentation, have an impact on all of those things, it could cause you to be pretty optimistic about some opportunities ahead. Back there. When you think of dig as an example, how do you explain how you added value to dig? Can you explain how you added value to dig? Well, I don't want to claim too much credit for what they did because I think they've done a great job and would have been just fine without me. My background is more of a marketing background. And so I try to help companies on two dimensions of marketing. The first dimension is what I call air wars marketing. And air wars marketing is about a company's provocative point of view. Is dig going to be more better slash dot or is it going to be an important new force in citizens journalism? Right? That's what conversation should dig be having in the marketplace. So that's the first thing is just how do we define the discussion in our terms that make us look like a really valuable important company that's going to make a difference and set a standard in a category. And then the second way I try to help is in the customer development area, what is the new math around our customer acquisition? What's going to be our time to doubleings? How can we in a bottoms up way figure out how to instrument our business to reduce our acquisition cost to increase our audience and global reach? How can we not just have it be an Excel spreadsheet but something that gets better every month, month after month in a systematic way? And so I try really hard to help on those two fronts. I mean there's a lot more to building a company than that. But I feel like if you cornered me and asked me what do you think you're among the best at? Probably two areas I can help more than most. Great. Yeah. I guess this would be going back to your answer about passion. And I guess this question is about you. But just talking about how you guys before you became angel investors, navigating majors back in the college days, first jobs, just kind of at stage of finding your passions and creating a line out of things. The question is how do you find your passions? Well, when I left, I went to centers, they stayed right down the road here. Went to national semi-conductor and it wasn't long before I had the startup bug and I helped start Alto's computer systems in the 70s. And after that, I went and acquired a company after that. Then I became a full time angel investor. So my passion has always been about entrepreneurism, myself an entrepreneur, but then finding out that I actually enjoyed helping other entrepreneurs a lot more. So I actually really enjoy helping entrepreneurs and watching them progress and succeed. There's a huge amount of satisfaction in that. It's not about the dollars, especially now. I have enough money that I just like watching the entrepreneur succeed in Excel. The amount of money that pops out at the end is actually a lot less important. There are two techniques that I think are pretty useful. One is what I call the coin flip. The way I look at it, most decisions are either 50-50 or obvious. If it's 49-51, it almost doesn't matter what you pick. Just pick one and execute it with brutal precision and you'll probably be okay. If it's 70-30, then what are you worried about? You already know the answer. When I find it, when I flip a coin, if it comes up heads and I wish it came up tails, I turn the coin over and I just do what Tails said. If it comes up heads and I say, oh, I knew all along I wanted to be heads, then I do what I said. It's surprising how you already know the answer and you just need to give yourself permission to do the thing you know is the right thing. There's just a lot of things in life that will talk you out of doing what's right. That's the first. The second technique is commit yourself to doing exceptional work always and being around people who have that ethic. If you do those two things and hang out with folks you trust, odds are that you'll end up okay. You may not start Google but you'll probably be okay. We are going to have one more question. This guy was trying to ask one. How important is the idea to start? Like, do any start and see that look for the boundary between the boundary and the boundary? The question is balancing the founding team versus the idea. How important is each? In my mind, 80% is the founder team, 20% is the idea. A good idea is really a prerequisite today. When I look at entrepreneur, when I see a company, it's the founders that I'm judging. Their personalities, their chemistry, the amount of passion, and then the chemistry I think I'm going to have with them. Will they listen? Will they be mentored and help work as a team? For me, it's an end gate. My most important thing is actually market. I think that a great market will basically pull a start up to greatness and give the start up a great range of options to even execute poorly and still come on top. I'm not saying the team doesn't matter. To me, it's an end gate. You don't want to say awesome market crummy team. But if the market doesn't seem awesome, to me, that's a show stop or I can't invest. I think that was a perfect way to stop. Let's give them a big round of applause.
