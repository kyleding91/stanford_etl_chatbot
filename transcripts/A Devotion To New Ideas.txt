 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. So it's my pleasure today to welcome Bill Gross, the CEO of a number of things, including E-Solar and some other properties. As you can see on the screen over here, here's a few of them over the last 15 years. But I've had the pleasure of knowing Bill, I want to just keep counting, past 15. When I was lucky to be in the software industry early on in the 80s, and Bill was making a mark for himself in Los Angeles. So we are really, really happy to have a Cal Tech grad and have a Los Angeles resident. I'm all the way up here in Northern California to share his wisdom. So give a big welcome to Bill Gross. There we go. Well, thank you very much for inviting me here. It's an honor to be here. I'd like to talk to you both about entrepreneurship and about my dreams for powering the planet sustainably. I've been starting businesses all my life ever since I was 12 years old. I'd like to share some of the painful lessons I've learned over those years with you. At the same time, hopefully inspire more of you to take an entrepreneurial path because of how ridiculously rewarding that can be. Well, first let me go back to 1973. It was the energy crisis. I was 15 years old. I grew up in San Fernando Valley. And while this energy crisis was going on, I was taking physics and trigonometry in high school. So I was learning about heat engines and parabolas. And I got very excited about connoxactions. And fortunately my high school had a metal shop. And I took metal shop and was trying to figure out how can we make devices that could possibly help the planet in this energy crisis at that time. So I started making little engines and parabolic concentrators. And my very first sketch was a very first sketch I found of a compact sterling engine that I wanted to make. And this was the actual engine running after I took a whole term of that metal shop class. And I took that engine and I took a little parabolic concentrator that I made to be able to make it run out the sun. And I started making plans and kits for them. And I actually started my first business then. A little company called Solar Devices. And I took out ads in the back of popular science magazine and scientific American magazine. A little $29 classified ads. But I sold these $4 plans. And I sold 5,000 of them. And I sold kits. And it actually helped me pay my way through college. It was really significant experience for me. I learned a lot about mail order. I learned a lot about testing. And I went to the library then and read every single book I could on direct mail and direct marketing to try and learn how to figure out what was effective in convincing people to buy these products or not. And I turned out to be very useful for me later in my career and I'll talk more about that. But one of the things I learned back then was to test the different ads I ran in the magazine. I would put a different address, a different return address in each ad. So it would say Sterling Engine kits, A-gros. And then try these new parabolas, B-gros. And that way I could check for which magazine it came from and actually compare from the cost of the ad to how many early version of click-throughs to try to figure out which ads were getting more response rate because I was really, really concerned about minimizing my costs and maximizing my sales. It was a very, very valuable experience for me. So then I got into Caltech and I continued the business when I was there and I was selling these kits and plans from the student houses there and from the labs that I was able to use at Caltech to improve my designs. But at the time I graduated in 1981, the price of oil had completely collapsed. There had been all kinds of cartels formed to drive down the price and stop all interest in renewable energy, all the research stopped, all the interest stopped. And unfortunately when I graduated, there was no interest in energy, but it was the IBM PC came out. So I ran down to my computer land in Pasadena and bought an IBM PC and taught myself the program and I had a 15 year detour in software products. I really, really loved what was possible with that and I'll try and abstract some lessons from some of the things I learned on that as well. So I started making a whole bunch of different software products. The very first one was this CPA plus product. It was a product that worked with Lotus 1, 2, 3, which had just come out at time. And then after that company I started, got acquired by Lotus. I made this product Lotus Hal, which was a natural language interface to 1, 2, 3. I really wanted to enhance the power of 1, 2, 3, reach more users. And I made a search product called Lotus Magellan. And then in 1991 my son started kindergarten. He was five years old at that time and I got really passionate about making sure he fell in love with learning. I was worried about that. I had a wonderful fourth grade teacher that made me become very passionate about learning. And really it was a turning point for me. I was worried that he might not have that teacher. So I wanted to try and make software that could do that. I'd seen this product, this amazing product in 1991. We might even have been at the conference together. I think it was Stuart Alsub's, Jim the conference. Someone demonstrated a product called Multimedia Beethoven. It was a really, really amazing product at the time. It was a CD-ROM product with a hypercard stack on a Mac. It was really, really incredible at how beautifully was able to express the power of Beethoven's ninth symphony. And I said, if this product could move me that much, relatively jaded individual, if this Multimedia product could have that much impact, you could probably do that for children with educational software. I'd like to do that for my son and his generation and try to make an impact there. So I quit Lotus in 1991. Originally actually, after Lotus acquired our company, they had signed me to a one-year contract, but I ended up staying there for six years. It was a really, really tremendous opportunity to learn at a big software company, how to work, as well as from the company's I started before that we were small. So I started this company called Knowledge Adventure. And our first product, we came out with dinosaur adventure, knowledge adventure, space adventure. We worked with Buzz Aldrin to make a product called Space Adventure. These were all CD-ROM products, Multimedia products in the early 90s. The company made an amazing pivot, and there's an important story in the pivot that the company made. We were selling a lot of products, thousands, tens of thousands. We were making a little bit of money. We got a Silicon Valley investor, more David Al, a really, really great person on our board. John Fiber joined our company and really, really helped us. And then from Mayfield, Mike Levinthal, so those were our two partners to help us grow the company. But we were really challenged to try and explain to people who the product was for. And one Christmas, we really wanted to make our sales numbers. And my brother, who's in the company with me as well, said, we should do this thing where we go into stores and really try and move the products ourselves. We had 65 people in the company at the time. And we each one of us took a laptop and a stack of products and would go to a Comp USA or an egghead software or a fries or whatever in like a 100 mile radius of Pasadena where we were based. And we would go in on a Saturday morning and set up, bringing a box of donuts to bribe the salespeople, let us set up at the end of the aisle. And we called it Weekend Warriors. Everybody in the company had a volunteer to take two weekend days, they get a day off during the week to make up for it. This was really trying to make our numbers a Christmas time. And we went in with demo all day at the end of the aisle showing parents the product with their kids in the software aisle. And we sold a lot of products. And the great thing about it was we would boost the sales and the stores we were at by so much that someone at headquarters like in Texas at Comp USA would say this big thing happening in California, they couldn't figure out what it was because we hadn't told them. But then they would order more for all of their stores. And that really, really boosts our sales. And eventually we got Walmart to carry our product because our numbers were going up so much from Comp USA. But one thing that we learned, after doing this for about four weeks, every Monday morning after the weekend warriors, we'd sit down at the company and we have everybody tell stories, war stories about what happened in their stores. And funny stories about parents with their children, what people liked. And we really had great sessions where we would learn more about the customer. And that's what's so powerful about the companies that can be developed today with the internet. We had to go out and meet the customer firsthand on the pavement. And then come back and tell stories about them. But now you can be in contact with all of your customers. It's obviously so incredible today. But let me tell you one of the things we learned. We found one of the people who went out to one of the stores saw that in the aisle, parents were confused about which product to buy for their particular child. They would look at their child, they'd pick up boxes, we'd see them turn the boxes over, they'd read the back, they'd try and figure out. And it was so confused because the products had a wide age range. We were competing against EA and Broderbund and other companies who had products as well. And there was Dr. Seuss products and others. It was very hard to figure out is this one going to be age appropriate for my child. And everybody to try and make the product more broad, us included, would put the widest age range we could on the box. In fact, I think one of our products in the knowledge of ENTURE said fun for ages 8 to 108, you know, kind of trying to say this would be good for everybody. Well turned out by saying that, it wasn't good for everybody. People couldn't figure out if it would be good enough for their particular child. What the idea we came up with was, what about if we make a product that was just for one year age range? What if we made something called Jumpstart kindergarten that was just for kindergarten? So just parents who had preschoolers or people in kindergarten or just before kindergarten would know this would give their kids a heads-up in kindergarten. And we had a big argument at the company about this. We had a argument with a sales team because they thought, I can't convince a store to take a product that's for only one year age range. It's not going to move enough. I can't convince distributors to take it. But we talked about it more and we really felt this was going to be a worthwhile experiment. We should make Jumpstart preschool and Jumpstart kindergarten, put them in the stores, we'll take the risk, it'll cost us 250 grand each to make them and let's just find out. And it was a pretty big risk, but we did it. The things sold probably 20 to 50 X are other products. Just because parents would come in and pick up the box, there was an aspirational aspect to it where people would say, hey, I have a three year old. I want him to do really well in kindergarten. I want her to do really well in preschool. And they would buy up even. When we eventually came out with Jumpstart first grade, parents with preschoolers were buying that because they wanted their kids to have a, and we eventually made all the way from toddler to sixth grade. We had Jumpstart toddler preschool kindergarten and then one through sixth. And we sold 20 million copies of that. It was a wild, wild success work and we would have never, ever discovered it. How we not been in the stores seeing the confusion of parents in the aisle and it was an enormous risk for our company. Maybe not that big of a risk because the expense was not great, but it was a big, we would have probably gotten a pretty big ding how the product not worked out. But if we hadn't heard from the parents so directly what they were looking for and what they were needing to make a decision, we would have never come up with that. Well, I've tried to reuse that lesson as much as I can in other companies going forward and this one got me so excited about the internet a number of years later about how you could have the real time interaction from a web browser and now without apps, you can have unbelievable real time interaction with customers to find out what they like to iterate and really deliver what they want. So I had this big D Tourant software and I had been starting all these companies, we sold this company in 1996. But every time we had a company in Knowledge Venture was one example of it, I always had these other ideas for things I wanted to do. I had this knowledge venture right around this time, 1995, Netscape had its IPO, there were 30 million browsers out there, I was getting really excited about doing things for online. I had this idea for a company called City Search, I really wanted to do it, I brought it to my board at Knowledge Venture and I said I had this other idea, we could do it in this company and it said it's going to be a distraction to try and do this other idea, it's just not on focus with Knowledge Venture. Bill, don't you see how the more and more we focus the company, the better and better we done, the fewer and fewer things we've done, the better the company has done. And I really sort of painfully learned a lesson that focus is always better unless you pick the wrong focus. Now you have to really think about that, you really have to evaluate, a focus really is always better as long as you pick the right focus but you really have to evaluate if you're really going down a path that is a focus that matches what customers want. But if you do, I think focus always wins but I was very unfocused personally so I couldn't resolve that problem and that's what led me to start IDLM. So IDLM was this technology incubator where I could be unfocused but I could tell all the companies to be very focused. And what I would do is get a separate CEO for each company and I would have them do as I say not as I do. I would be able to participate in many, many different ideas and brainstorm new ideas but each company would have a laser-like focus on their one target market and not try to do too many things. And it was kind of a weird experiment, I didn't know if it would work but we tried it out and I got a few investors to go alongside some money I put up myself from having sold knowledge venture and we started developing a process, a important part of the process that I realized, one other thing I'd realized back from knowledge venture as well on motivation was that if whenever we'd start a new division inside knowledge venture it was very hard to come up with the incentive structure to not have that incentives for that particular group conflict with this incentives of the overall company. And I really felt that equity is such a great driver of performance and such a great motivator that I really wanted to have the most equity available for someone but a knowledge venture once we'd grown to 250 people almost by definition the maximum number of equity someone could have is 0.4% just taking the whole 100% and dividing evenly and you can't do that and you have investors and so on. So there's a magic that happens when you can give people above 1% in a company. People really feel like they have a significant stake when they have that. So one of the other ideas of Ideal Lab was by starting these separate independent companies it was sort of like manufacturing a new 100% equity pool for each project. Each new project that would form as a company I have a new 100% to play with so I can start bringing in people with higher equity stakes albeit of smaller companies but if things they have more control and impact over and that was very motivating to them. So we started Ideal Lab and we came up with this process and we would start out and look for big problems and challenges at the world with face trying brainstorm technological solutions to them and then start prototyping the idea like crazy and then kill a lot of things that don't work and the particular idea that I had at Ideal Lab was to be able to kill things with no negative impact to people because as much as you say that you want to encourage risk and take chances and all that if people see people getting fired to lay off when they take a risk and doesn't pay off they won't do it. I mean it doesn't matter what you say everybody sees what's going on. So the structure of Ideal Lab was I could hire a bunch of great people in Ideal Lab who were always going to be working on new ideas and then the ones we don't work out we just shelve and work on a new idea and the ones that pass will form a company and that will get handed off to new people sometimes the people who work in the product might want to go with it but new people would come to it we have to recruit those new people to come to it but in that way it made it very easy for people to see that they can take chances on things and try new risky things and they're not going to get fired and that's a really crucial thing if you want to if you want to really have some breakthrough new thing you can't have someone worrying about their job being on the line about taking a risk to try something bold and new so that was one of the important structural things we realized and we set up for Ideal Lab. So in Ideal Lab we've done 100 companies over the last 15 years. Tom he said earlier those companies I had on the screen right now were just the ones in the portfolio today but over 15 years we've done so many different things and we've had some wild successes and some wild failures. We learned a lot more from the wild failures I can tell you. One of the most impactful companies we had was a company called GoTo. I told you our first company was CitySearch. GoTo was a really great company that we started a paper click we created paper click in 1998. People thought that was a terrible idea. In fact one particular quote when we first came out with it in the Wall Street Journal I think interviewed by Don Clark someone from Yahoo said that is the most awful company I've ever seen. We would never do that in our search results and five years later they bought the company. But we really thought it was a good idea and we stuck with it even despite some people not liking the idea at the very beginning. It turned out to be a very big success for us. Another company that we started way too early, a lot of companies we started way too early but at the right time the market grew. In 1999 digital cameras were just starting to really make an impact. They were really really early. But we really felt there was going to be a day when people were going to have challenge managing all their photos, managing all their images. We started a company called Picasso and it was way too early and we really struggled at the beginning but we stuck with it and stuck with it and built it and then eventually Google saw it and Google bought it in 2005 and I'm so thrilled. One of the reasons we sold it to Google is they said they would keep it up. They weren't going to buy it to kill it. They were going to buy it to grow it and really build on it and we're so happy they did. We've done a great job with it, still the program that I used today. Some of the ideas we started were way too early and they were just way too early and we couldn't survive until the market came and the market was ready for it. We started some companies in 1999 that were really really great companies in New Media and Entertainment but they were so early because there was too small broadband penetration and too many of our customers were using dial up and it was too slow and the products and offerings were great and the companies decided to spend their money too fast to try and grow market share and when you're spending your money against the will of what the customer wants you can't convince them to come if they don't have the right equipment or the right mentality and the companies went out of business. We have a really big lesson I learned is to try and take your cash if you have something that's really great and survive until the market is ready for you because almost by definition if you're coming up with something that's novel or breakthrough or head of the competition it's too early and sometimes you could be early enough that they're just not ready for you yet. If you're going to come up to and decide to wait you can shell it and wait or you can stick it out and there are some companies that seem like overnight successes but they really stuck it out until the market was really ready for them and that was a very painful we lesson we learned with a lot of companies. From some of the failures besides those we learn things about management teams and what kind of skills you need on management teams and I'll talk a little bit about that as well. So the biggest pieces of advice I could give on companies starting from some of these lessons first follow your passion. So one commentate of all the things that I started doesn't mean you're going to succeed but I think it's almost a necessary condition for success even if it's not sufficient is that you absolutely have to be so crazy in love with what you're doing and I say that because every startup is going to face hardship times really deep dark days and the only way you make it through it is if you and your team is passionate about it so that you have a reason to continue through those otherwise you give up and if I didn't love all the things I was working on I wouldn't have done those things in the tough days at knowledge of entry to make it through if I didn't love the things I was doing on the energy stuff I wouldn't have stuck it through. So it really really I believe it really matters that you're unbelievably passionate. The second one sharing your upside I talked about that earlier I think that you unlock so much human potential when you give someone a significant equity stake and give everyone everyone in the company. The teamwork that is engendered and the human potential that is unlocked when people have a big equity stake is unbelievable and that's a really important thing that I we do in all of our companies and you know the receptionist everybody in the company has equity in the company and the early receptionist of the company might make you know 50 times their salary when the company has a big success and that's a great thing to happen and everybody loves seeing that happen and it's just an incredible how emotionally gratifying that is to watch and be part of and I really strongly recommend that and then on the complimentary skills on management teams let me talk to you about that a little bit. So there are obviously a million ways of measuring the different personality types of people. This is one particular taxonomy the entrepreneur, the producer, the administrator, the integrator and no person is just one of those four. Everybody is a blend of all of these talents but everybody is dominant in one and has weaknesses in the other and so I'm clearly an entrepreneur I really love inventing the new things, seeing things in the distance and trying to do things ahead of their time. The producer is the person who actually makes things happen you know who actually takes a product and executes on it who sells it, who all the execution stages to get it in customers hand and I'm very high on the e, I'm actually moderate on the p, there are some entrepreneurial types who have no p and they're just not good at that or even negative you know they get it in the way of getting things done and that's actually okay as long as they find someone else to compliment them who is good at getting things done and then has mutual trust and respect for them so that together as a team they can get things done but you have to get the p in the company as well and then the administrator that's a little bit more the bureaucrat you have to have that in the company to to succeed it sometimes gets in the way of things but it also helps organize things the administrator puts systems in place and helps the trains run on time it keeps the wheels in the bus when things are going crazy when orders are going gang busters and it helps and any one of these skills taken to extreme is a negative but any one of these skills in the right balance with others is exactly what you want and the final skill the integrator that is the person who is more of a people person who understands the other three people there and helps those other three people those three talents get along because very often those other three talents hate each other's guts and like like you know sometimes the e hates the a sometimes almost always the p hates the a you know the p wants to get things done and the a is trying to put a system in place and and you really need to have all of them I'll just give you an example it's just so you can sort of self classify yourself and in your strengths and weaknesses and these different things imagine that there's those four personality types sitting together in a room you know there's a window over there and we're looking out and the and the windows over there and there's some dirt on the window and the e looks at the window and says look over there there's a parking lot we could build a building that can you see all of this stuff in the future doesn't even see the window the p looks at the window says it was a scratch in that window that window is dirty we've just we better clean that take care of that the a looks at the window and says you know we can make a form and people could fill out when they see something wrong and then they'll turn that in and that will go in a queue and then we'll get that taken care of and and the I looks at that and says I wonder what those three people are thinking and it really is true there are many people I don't do it enough on the I I have some I but not enough I try and always hire an eye at the company where the I is actually more worried about what other people are thinking of feeling than the actual product or execution or a customer but that's hugely important and the I is the person who sits in a room when the p is screaming at the a and says listen you both have a point here the p wants to get this done and the a says let's do this and how about if we do and bridges the gap and as an important skill for CEO to have as well of course to try and bridge that balance but it's really important to try and find balance in the company and all those skills and let me show you an example of what happens in a company that doesn't have all those because I've seen this many times and this is one of the things we learned after so many companies and you think about this we've had you know 100 companies in 15 years probably 150 CEOs probably say three rounds of financing each so 300 rounds of financing and all the problems and challenges and products and delays and all the things and the companies that made it had all these skills and balance and the companies they didn't didn't and let me give you the very specific example so a company always starts with the e you know an i can't start a company an a start can't start a company the company starts with the vision of the e person you know the entrepreneurial person and the company starts out with that e and it's sort of making forward progress it's going up you know sort of you know up into the right because there's a vision there but then very quickly if the e just has vision and can't execute anything the thing just fizzles out and turns it to nothing and it has to bring this p skill into the company at some point you know it could be in a week it could be in a month it could be a year but at some appropriate point before the idea fizzles out some p skill has to happen to the company now it could be a solo entrepreneur who isn't any who also knows how to program or knows how to build or knows how to do whatever so that can be in the same person but it's got that skills got to be there and it's usually better if it's in another person who really gets along with the e it really is great when there's a team who gets along but then eventually even if the company starts producing things and start selling things and starts going it eventually too will fail if it doesn't get some system in place to be able to handle the order get the money in the bank pay the bills pay the employees those are all a like functions but there's many other a like functions that have to happen to make the company get past that stage but even then a company will eventually fail because everybody will be at war with one another unless there's enough i-skill on the company to keep the company going up and one of the things that i wish i had learned when i was in college and life anywhere was what this i-skill even was and how to learn more about it myself and and i never had a class and how to do the conflict resolution between people when when they are having problems or even to to see good ways of giving people feedback that's a very very valuable skill to make a successful company if you look at some of the really really incredible companies they almost always had great teams of people you know sometimes a duo sometimes more at the top who really really had opposite skills but really really got along has such mutual trust respect for one another that you really got the best out of both of them you never had any war between them and that really is amazing when that happens and uh... if i if i would have any single thing that i would recommend for success in a company not it would be this after of course having a decent idea but i even think this is more important than having a decent idea because this team working together can take a not so decent idea and turn into a decent idea because they'll have a method to get from not decent to incredible whereas a great idea will usually fizzle if it doesn't have all this together so that's one one thing that i learned very painfully i wish i'd learned it earlier in my career i could have made some things that weren't successful successful but i really uh... urgent a lot of this learning came to me from a consultant named each other these is who first thought about this in the life cycles of companies and the different stages of companies go through you can you can plot this either in time or at stage of revenues or things like that but there's a great degree of flexibility i'm just saying i'm repeating it a lot of times because i think it's important get compliment your skills in your startup it's very very valuable so now fast forward after doing this for a while your two thousand comes around starting many software and internet companies and i realized that we're really going to have a big resource problem this entry if we don't find a way to make our energy renewably and this was pretty early this was before a lot of the clean tech interest started but i started reading a lot about peak oil and things that were going on in the world and realize this would be a big problem and it really brought me back to my passion that i had in high school but now this much later i had a lot more resources available to me i had a deal up available i had a team of people now i learned how to make companies i was doing solo devices at little tiny thing solo back then now i had i learned some of these lessons about putting teams together so i got excited about going back and trying to tackle something in this energy challenge my skill was in software and engineering the cantal engineering actually was my degree but i had never built a real large solar energy or energy company before but we built a shop and i deal up actually ironically i deal up with a passadena and next door there was a Korean restaurant we were able to buy the Korean restaurant and turn the kitchen into a machine shop because it's already plumbed and everything and had all the concrete and ventilation and that machine shop was where he began working on the solar energy research and let me tell you why i thought it was such a big problem that the world was facing in energy and why it's been great the movement that's been made but how much has to happen in this next decade so many of you have seen this before this is symbolic of man's and tanch energy usage let me tell you some specific numbers so the whole planet uses 15 terawatts and continuous use 24 hours a day 15 terawatts are being used to provide the energy to all of humanity if you divide that 15 terawatts by about seven billion people you get about 2200 watts per person so every single person alive on the planet is using 2200 watts all day long 24 hours a day to power our lifestyles now those of us in this room are using a lot more than 2200 watts many people in deep parts of India are using 50 watts so those of us in this room are probably using more like 10 to 20 thousand and if we fly a bunch probably more like 30 thousand and if we use a lot of air conditioning and drive a lot maybe more like 50 thousand so 50 thousand watts all day long just making our lives comfortable and we're mostly burning stuff to do to do that and just just to get a sense of of the energy typical family has 24 horses running for them at full out all day long producing energy if you just convert the horsepower just to give you a sense of we don't really think about the energy because it's you know burn somewhere else to make our electricity the fumes go somewhere else the electrons come over copper so we don't see any of it the the big pipelines that bring stuff over you know it's mostly hidden from us we go to the gas station all the tanks run to ground you know we fill our tanks and drive around so we don't see it if we were actually taking care of and feeding 24 horses constantly we would sort of be more aware of the energy usage but but we don't it's it's really we've done a good job of making it invisible to us and another interesting statistic on what's happened just in the last few years in the United States there's now 1.8 people per household and 1.9 cars per household so we have more cars per household than we do people and that just shows our love of you know we love taking our bodies wrapping them in two tons of steel and moving up somewhere else and you think about how much energy we're doing to carry that two tons of steel along with our bodies just unbelievable and yet we just do it because it's relatively inexpensive you know we've come up with a great way to make it not cost that much now the problem is if we run out of the stuff it's going to cost a lot it's going to cause a lot of resource battles a lot of fighting and here's why I think we're going to have some of those challenges jump forwards to 2050 and it's estimated that we're going to need 50 terawatts and the 50 terawatts is is not so much because of population growth because people believe the population growth is going to slow down and we're only going to be at about 9 billion people by 2050 so even with conservative population growth we're going to need 50 terawatts because we're lifting so many people out of poverty and the first thing people want when they get live in a poverty is they want their car and they want their plasma screen they want their iPhone they iPhone doesn't use that much energy but they want all the electronics that we have and and all the electricity production that we have and if you take number of people on the planet times somewhat closer not quite our less standard of living but even a little bit of you get to 50 terawatts so there's a 35 terawat gap between the 15 terawatts we're burning right now and where we need to get and there's only a limited number of places that can come from of course we can burn things to get there but we're going to run the things we can burn so there's only a limited number of places and there's nuclear geothermal wind tides biomass and solar and each of these only can contribute about two or three terawatts and the reason why I can only contribute that much is because you build a nuclear power plant a gigawatt nuclear power plant and if you build one nuclear power plant every other day for the next 35 years you only get to a number you know it's sort of in this order and it takes about seven years to permanent nuclear power plant right now so you're not going to build one every other day so you just can't get 35 terawatts gap from nuclear from any of these for geothermal you could put a geothermal power plant at every single site on earth where there's heat underground and you get about two terawatts so I'm not saying we shouldn't do it you have to do it but you don't get 35 from there and the same thing with wind you go to every single high wind location on a planet put a wind turbine every single one and you get relatively low three terawatts tidal power biomass if you go make a biomass plant almost everywhere where we grow food you can get to this three terawatts still only a tenth of what we need the sun however strikes the earth with 15,000 terawatts so a thousand times we're using right now 500 times the 35 terawatts we need it's the only one that can really make up that kind of gap with a very tiny fraction and yet why don't we do it it's because it's too expensive so you go back and look solar is the most uniform natural resource maybe except for air and dirt solar is evenly distributed across the whole planet you know the very very top of the planet very very bottom the planet there's not much sun but almost everywhere else there's enough sun to do this with and everybody gets it you know it's not like scarcity like other of our natural resources the sun goes to everybody so it's a really fair resource as well but it's very very hard to convert it cost effectively it also takes a relatively small amount of land people talk about how much land it takes but you can power the whole United States with a square 83 miles by 83 miles so you wouldn't put it all in one spot you spread it around but it's a relatively doable amount of space and of course you can power all of Europe with a square about the same size actually a little smaller in the northern Sahara desert so you can really practically make it happen if we can get the cost right and the problem has been that it's been too much earlier this decade solar was costing about four times other ways of making electricity for example now it's down to about two times we've made a lot of progress in the last eight years since this chart came out of the last nine years but it's still two times too expensive so the way solar has been going so far it's all been with subsidies and I really believe that solar energy is just a novelty until it can be the price of fossil fuels without subsidies so there's a lot of interest around the world but the governments don't have the money and the amount of money is too great to be able to subsidize the gap between the cost of fossil fuels and solar but once you cross the price of fossil fuels with solar then it will take off wildly because then it'll be an enormous profit opportunity I mean even if you beat the price of fossil fuel general electricity by one hundredth of a cent that'll be unbelievable you don't have to beat it by a lot because it's a commodity you beat a commodity by a little bit and then just people flock to that because they can make a profit there so there's a unbelievable opportunity if you could just get that last factor of two out and people are working on it so a lot of different ways we're going to get there I'll talk to you about some of them and then talk to you about one that I'm working on so the breakthrough to get that last factor of two it could be some kind of chemical breakthrough there could be some kind of solar paint or some kind of solar plant it could be biological breakthrough some kind of organism it could be a physics engineering breakthrough it could be all of these and I think it's going to be all of these I think the opportunity is so big that we have to invest heavily in all these areas and I know a lot of that investment is going on here I'm going to talk to you about one particular new weapon that I think we have in the solar arsenal to try and get there this new weapon in the solar arsenal I feel is Moore's Law and let me talk to you about some other resources and their trend lines if you look at coal it's going up oil's going up natural gas is going up steel gold medals everything food corn rice everything's going up the one thing that's going down consistently over the years the price of computing power is going down so much while everything else in the world is going up because everything else is a scarce resource and computing power the way we've been able to use our brain power to fit more in less space means that cost is going down so dramatically how can we use this how can we use Moore's Law to try and down drive down the price of solar energy so I started thinking about that a lot I started thinking about how can I take the one thing that's going down in price and apply that to solar you can't apply Moore's Law to PV panels to to photovoltaic cells because PV panels don't have micro processors on them or in them they're not taking advantage of the density that Moore's Law brings they're taking advantage of maybe a slight reduction in cost of silicon but that's that's again a natural resource that's not going down PV cells are based on area of usage you just need a lot of area well that means you have to use all the heavy intensive energy process and chemical process to make the cells on a large area basis well we need to come up with a some way to apply Moore's Law that doesn't need the area some way we can use a small micro processor to leverage against something that's big so that's what I started working on I took a look at a taxonomy of all the different types of solar things and over here on the left you have photovoltaic techniques silicon panels thin film panels concentrated PV panels and over on the right solar thermal and you have dishes and troughs power ball troughs and linear for now concentrators and power tower and I looked at all these things and all way over here this is the highest efficiency the solar power tower the solar thermal power tower is the highest efficiency solar conversion in the high 30 percent you can get so I figured if there's any place to try and apply Moore's Law to be way over here on the right and that's what I wanted to try and do how do you apply Moore's Law to this high efficiency solar conversion system so this is what we the company we created to do that is called e-solar this is a picture of an e-solar plant in southern California and I'll talk to you how we applied Moore's Law to this so the typical solar power plant that does solar thermal concentration takes a large mirror a big parabolic mirror that is about the size of a tennis court and tries to track it into axes to concentrate sunlight to a single tower but that requires huge construction in the field we thought what if you take that mirror and break it up into lots of little tiny mirrors now all of those would have to be controlled separately because they all have to move differently over the day to redirect their light to a single point they're not all moving together they're moving differently but that's exactly what a microprocessor would be good at what if we put a microprocessor in every single mirror so compared to doing this big assembly and cranes and an assembly in the field because this is larger than could be shipped this is larger than shipping container each of these things could be smaller than shipping container we could deliver it and this is what we came up with a system that comes out these things get pulled out of a shipping container they get unfolded like an accordion onto the field and get bolted down to a bunch of ballast that are sitting on the ground and just uses a regular wrench to tighten down such as regular hand tools so we get rid of all the heavy equipment then you walk down the aisles and put the mirrors on and they're all crooked and different angles and everything like that but we're going to use software to try and straighten that all out and this is what it looks like at the ground level you can see these racks that have all the wiring in advance double axis actuators and some plain old about one square meter flat mirrors so we don't have to curve the mirrors anymore we don't have to make a parabola in metal and in glass we're now going to make a parabola in software so we're going to concentrate the sunlight dynamically with software and the way we do that is this we again taking advantage of Moore's Law 2 today you can buy high resolution sensors you can put on some towers in the corner and those sensors can look at all the mirrors and really detect every single mirror with image recognition pick out each mirror with a GPS time clock figure out the time of day and where the sun is and look at the reflected beam coming out of each mirror and in real time compute the angle of every mirror and we can do it a way way higher precision than you ever could by surveying where the mirror is the way it's been done in the past now requires a $2 micro processor in every mirror for a 2 micro processor is now negligible and off the shelf product that you know even 10 years ago to cost $5,000 per mirror and you couldn't have done it but today it cost $2 so it's just unbelievable what has happened that Moore's Law allows us to take place we can we can point the mirror as much more precisely which means higher temperatures and higher efficiency less spillage of light at the receiver and we can just get much much more cost effectiveness because we can have lighter structures less steel and less labor all made up for by microprocessors so what it looks like as an example when you first put down this row of mirrors it's maybe hard to see back there but on the left because the ground is a little bit unflat because the metal has thermal expansion is a little bit crooked because the mirrors have end stops that aren't exactly aligned the best you can do with lining this up the mirrors are accurate plus or minus about three degrees but then after you run the software and command the mirrors to go flat you can see here this row is accurate to a 20th of a degree about the most accurate anybody ever achieved with this method was a half a degree and now we're at a 20th of a degree so we're 10 times more accurate just with a $2 micro processor in every single mirror so it really has it has caused a big difference in cost a big difference in performance and this is what the whole plant looks like so here's rows of mirrors you can see the parabola is made and all the mirrors are all slightly curved all the light from the sun is reflected up to the tower up at a tower it's immensely hot and then we make steam and then run a steam turbine at high efficiency and take the electricity and go into the grid so this was this is a five megawatt plant this one in Palmdale California and we now have an order for a thousand megawatts in India and two thousand megawatts in China the one in India is already under construction China will be getting begin next year and you can imagine how proud I am of this when I started with my little tiny stuff back in high school to be able to walk in a field like this it's an it's an eerie feeling actually because it's very quiet you don't really hear much because there's little tiny motor actuators moving the mirrors the steam of course you don't hear any of that in the tower there's a man's amount of thermal energy up on the top of the tower and it's very very bright but it's a really really amazing site to see to be able to take Moore's Law apply to an old idea but really drive down the cost and hopefully get us there we're within striking distance of the price of fossil fuels right now and with some additional storage techniques and additional production we should be able to get to the price of fossil fuels in just three to five years now this is just one way of doing it there's many many ways we encourage all of them but I was just really excited to share with you this one particular angle of how you could take entrepreneurship Moore's Law and Technology apply to relatively static field and solar energy and try and make a new way to try and arbitrage those technologies to try and make a breakthrough in quick summary I really do feel we have to get to majority renewable energy this entry the only question is whether it's going to be painful or respectful to get there because we're going to get there by force one way or another it's just going to be how how problematic if we are for apply for site and start working on it all out this decade we can make it be with less pain as not just about climate change it's about resource wars I mean even if you don't even if you're not worried all about climate change we need to get there anyway because we're going to have big fights over the stuff we burn if we don't get there because everybody's going to want to live like us and we have everybody in the planet wanting to live like us they're just not going to be enough to go around it's very very hard to compete with fossil fuels with no subsidies but it's possible and I really feel that should be the goal and should be the goal of this decade and I personally believe as I've told you here innovation engineering and science that's the way to solve this problem and not only I think not laws I don't think laws forcing people to do it are the way to get there I think innovating is the way to get there and I actually personally believe that entrepreneurship is the best way to mobilize great minds to do this problem but actually I think to mobilize to solve almost any problem so I really encourage that thank you very much you have been great audience. Well it's really an honor to be here and I'd love to answer any questions that I can for you on any front on energy or on entrepreneurship starting companies challenges we had anything yes yeah what do we do about the problem of currently the concentration of wealth and with this industry be able to work against that or is it going to be more of the same question on concentration of wealth I think this industry actually can combat that my belief is that it would because the resources so distributed the the system has to be put where the people are so unlike other wealth which is concentrated in a country and then someone hordes it and then throttles it out to people by selling it around the world you know rare earth metals or oil or anything this has to be placed where the resource is where the people are so I hope that this would lead to a more even distribution I'm not sure that it will but I hope that it does sorry me okay first I just want to say that it was really cool to see the presentation I actually used the jumpstart stuff oh great oh that's it so when I saw it up there oh not it feels really great I hope I hope you enjoyed it I'm that's hamper now so yeah we didn't put that on the box use jumpstart get into Stanford but I just also wanted to say so I was reading about ideal lab I'm in the MSN1-7-8 class and we had like we have discussion before each of the speakers come in and one of the questions that kept coming up was yeah the fact that ideal lab is kind of like something between venture capital firm and a startup incubator and the one big difference is that you guys don't take outside ideas and kind of come up with your own ideas and I guess I was wondering obviously it's been successful so far especially since a lot of the companies that had been shown in the slides have been acquired or have done wealth in themselves but I was just wondering do you ever think that or do you think that's a competitive advantage that you don't take outside business proposals that you don't spend the time at BC's D meeting entrepreneurs or is that or do you ever feel that idea generation becomes stagnant with all the staff that ideal lab? Question about the idea generation and taking ideas from the outside I actually think it's a competitive disadvantage that we wouldn't take ideas from the outside and meet outside entrepreneurs so we're actually starting to do that more the reason we did it was not because it's smart or not it's just we had more ideas we wanted to do than we could find people to do now it's been my problem on my life that just every week we're coming up with a new idea we would do 52 companies a year if we could and it's just finding talent to execute on those ideas that is the bottleneck so we are taking having people come to us from the outside with ideas sometimes that idea murders with one of ours sometimes we'll fund that company separately but I really think of what we do as we're really trying to be more of a lab where we can do it where we have the chance just because we like it I'm not saying this is a good business model I just we love doing it we love being in the part of experiencing new idea generation trying them out and seeing what works and doesn't work that's just fun to us and the other aspect that we're trying to do is we're trying to make a big impact so we actually are looking probably in our criteria for going forward with an idea will this idea be someone that someone else something that someone else would never have done because then we can make more impact on the world we'd rather do something sometimes we come up with ideas a great idea test out of the business model but sort of close to what other people are doing so even if we can make an okay business it's just not interesting enough for us again that's just our choice so we're trying to judge on impact not ROI you know sort of impact ROI and we try and find ways to meet great people who can help us do the things that we think will have big impact a little more on idea generation in the idea since I mean do these just come to you or do you have a methodology that's what I'm talking about well a lot of them are things that I personally want I mean I really have to say like even even paper click with something that I personally wanted because we had other companies that were trying to find ways to market more effectively online and I needed that as a way so so so many of the things that we do are things that we find and need for that we see there's a big need at least for us because we feel it's very hard to predict what someone else might want but to talk a little bit more about the idea generation part well we have regular brainstorming sessions we we we have 50 people in ideal lab there's about 15 people the core who really are involved in the brainstorming we have these sessions a lot of ideas we come up with we can't carry out but we patent things still maybe they'll get useful later we bring in outside people to brainstorm with us I've had a brainstorming session with Nathan Mervold and intellectual ventures to try and brainstorm new ideas but what I mostly do is I just read everything so I'm just always reading everything and looking at what's going on and seeing what else people are doing and trying to find new ways to combine different things that I see happening with a new technology that I see to try and do you know with this technology and this problem and this there's something new there and that's the way I try and come up with them back there you talk a little bit more about the methodology used to compare various ideas that you generate to air how you compare compare how do you object to their ideas yeah that's a good question how do we objectively compare ideas it's very hard and it's very emotional for sure now because as I said one of our metrics is impact sometimes we look at two ideas one that has a better business opportunity but we look and we say you know I think this is going to change the world more it would be better for people better for humanity let's do that you know we have a company we started I'll call Duron Power and it's a company that is making very small scale solar solutions for villagers in India and Africa so a $99 product with a solar panel and battery and lighting and cell phone charger and fan and and we we're not going to make very much money on that we're selling it for maybe a few dollars more than we make it for and but if we can have a million families have that it will have a great impact so we chose to go with that one even though it wasn't maybe the best economic one so measuring that is one way the other way we try and compare is we do business models and projections and forecasts we of course do that we do focus groups we test on people the thing we really like to do and probably the thing that I don't know for known for this but it's the thing that I'm most proud of what we do is we try and find ways to come up with the absolute minimum viable product and test it and I think you guys have heard that variation variation that theme before but I'll give you one specific story so one thing that I wanted you know going back to things I want it's like 1997 or 1998 I think and people were starting to use use credit cards online Amazon was taking off but still a lot of people were scared about putting credit cards online and I wanted to get a new car and I didn't want to go to dealer and I just hated the hassle of going to a car dealer I've been so messed up by all the lies and everything that I got from going to a car dealer so I wanted to go to website and I want to do the whole transaction to website and I wanted the car show up at my house in flat bed truck and I thought that's the way the whole transaction should occur and but I told people that idea and they said that's crazy I don't think people do it people are gonna buy a car online no one's gonna use a credit card no one's gonna put a deposit of a thousand dollars down without seeing the car and I said yeah I think they will because I'll do the research and I'll figure out what car I want and I know what I want and I'll configure it and I just want to buy it so that was the concept it was called cars direct and we had a lot of disbelievers but I we had a budget of a hundred thousand dollars and 90 days I gave a particular CEO that we found a budget of a hundred thousand dollars and 90 days to see if someone wants to buy a car online and the idea was to make a website where you could configure some cars and we'd see if people would put in a thousand dollar deposit to do it and then if they did we would sell them the car and and he kept on coming back into me you know 30 days in okay we're talking to car dealers about this and getting supply go what are you talking to car dealers for I just want you to make a website and he's talking to find out how to become a dealer for Ford and dealer for Honda and all that we're not gonna do that we're just we're just seeing if someone wants to do it and then he come back in 60 days and well I'm working on this and I go and I kept on the 80th day I said just put the side up and if someone buys a car put it up at the end of the day so when buys a car by the morning we'll turn the side off and we'll go buy them at the Honda Auto Mall down in Monroe via and we'll deliver the car to them we are not trying to actually sell a car we're trying to so so he finally put the side up on one Thursday evening I remember coming in on Friday and he came up to me and said we sold four cars I said hurry up and turn the side off but we saw that people wanted to buy a car we you know they didn't know that we were driving down to pick up the car and you know that didn't matter but then we turned the side off and then we built out the system because the test worked you know we found out that someone actually would do that so I really really try and do that all the time with our companies like how could you find out in some fake collude way do people really like what you have and then go build the whole thing if they do but don't build the whole thing first and then find that out of course yes clearly I've all sorts of brilliant thinkers working with you how do you put the ideas out that you can't pursue yourselves for other people to pursue that's a really good question we don't do enough of that and I'd like to invent a company to do that I would like to invent a company that could allow people to come together around ideas and sort of self-organize around ideas that we come up with or other people come up with and I'm thinking about that right now it's in the early stages but stay tuned there might be some way to be able to do that yes right here so I'm like the problem with other lectures yes uh service curious you you mentioned uh you decided for eventually summer so was was that when you described what was like you know when you your first company used to have you be passionate about it it's always like it's your baby so you do uh was it hard to make that decision it's always hard to make that decision um and it's hard it's hard now that we have ideal lab where sometimes a company grows up and moves out of our building and it's sad I mean we where it's it's our baby and and um but you know I I've experienced that with my kids now so I've experienced that with our companies it's a lot like that um uh with knowledge of nature um my brother took over for me so I felt like it was in good hands and I really really wanted to try this ideal lab experiment I really wanted to try this thing where you could do multiple companies under one roof at one time I'd always been starting companies in my life in series and I wanted to try doing it in parallel and um because my brother was there to take over for me it was a great way to make it happen yes um you were talking about failure and starting having ideas but for just a little bit too early for the market um I'm just curious about sort of one of those failure stories and speaking to entrepreneurs who maybe don't have an amazing company around them like ideal lab to keep them going for a couple extra years what is your advice for how do you know when to stop oh yeah boy well let me do the last one first um it is really really hard to know when to stop I mean the hallmark of success is perseverance and sticking through the tough times but it would also be a hallmark of stupidity to stay with something too long when when all the indicators and all the signals are saying there's no market for this and I've experienced that many times we have had a bunch of companies we had a company Omelux which was doing optical mesh communications we had a um a bunch of different companies we tried that we just tried and tried and tried and we're always close and it always seemed like the order was around the corner it is so hard to tell it is so hard we had another company uh Ray Tracker that we started was making solar energy trackers that was just always about to get a customer always about to get a customer and we kept on it just wasn't happening it was during the crash just now the economic crash last few years and the product was good and it seemed like sales were coming and we had a pipeline but just no one could get their financing and and we just stuck with it and stuck with it and we had so many tough decisions tough board meetings where we were we really thought we should kill it and we kept on putting money in and then the corner turned a little bit in 2009 and then it got a little better and then the company sold to first solar a few months ago in a great exit for us and that was a success story where we stayed and there was an equal other story where we stayed and we felt the same emotion and it failed so there is no simple thing I can look at and say you know if you see this sign it's going to make it and if you see this sign it isn't it takes a lot of luck and timing to make everything work out and it just takes really digging down and looking at all this uh the circumstances I would say probably the best thing is getting outside advisors that you trust to look at the situation with you so that at least your own bias you know because of your course you're in love with the idea your own bias isn't the only thing looking at the idea and you can listen to other people doesn't mean you should listen to them blindly but it means you should hear the other voices and we brought in some outside advisors in this particular case who thought you know this really does seem right the team seems good the product seems good it's worth sticking with a little more I remember putting like an extra million dollars in and we made it and then it turned the corner and then it was a great success on the first part of your question on on the um some lessons from from a failure uh it's almost always a team or running out of money you know team issues whether team doesn't get along or has doesn't have all the skills or uh team is spending too fast and doesn't conserve cash the first one is probably the harder one because fun the great people that have all the skills is always hard the second one should be easy but sometimes people are so emotional about people are often so worried and this was one of the excesses of the dot com crash so worried about if I don't spend the money now I'm going to lose the market share I'm never going to be able to you know it's about to go away and it's going to get way more expensive and that's always the excuse for spending faster and it almost I haven't seen too many cases where that works it does work sometimes I mean there are cases where there truly is a race to a winner take all like market but usually the better executor with the greater persistence wins so I would say those would be the two biggest lessons from a failure yes with tens of companies under your roof at one time how do you scale your own talent to be able to touch each one in a real life yeah well that's really hard um but it's what I love to do so I try and um you know give uh 25 percent each to 10 companies you know um uh that's what I I work a lot I'm always in contact with all the CEOs I meet with them up here at least what I what I found for me the way it works is I try and only be involved in the very important strategic and product things and not involved with more of the minutiae of the company I'm really not involved in the finances or HR other things I have other people on a deal lab who take care of that so I really try and focus on that where I have the most value add and the stuff I love the most and then I really try to be available more in prompt to like sort of just in time so I try and stay aware of what's happening in a company and give a piece of wisdom or or experience uh right when they're having that problem as opposed to trying to you know what I'm doing here so I'm trying to give you examples these might not apply to you at that particular moment but if I give you a really laser like focused targeted thing when you're having that problem it can be very helpful so I try and do that for the companies as well having them in the in the building is pretty great though because then I can just walk around you know a lot of you see say they like to have uh companies within 30 minutes of them I like to have them in 30 seconds so just as I'm walking around at lunch we have a a bar at the company where people hang out and just all around I just hear things and see things going on so I can be connected to them very very casually and that's one of the things I really like to do one more question yes right here um so you observe companies going from birth to finished product and you do that with a bunch of different companies all the time uh is there a particular stage of the development process for each company that you that's really enjoyable for you or or for you to say it's this unenjoyable yeah well for me uh being that E off the charts there the very early stage I love it I love seeing an idea go from nothing to something and then um uh you know all the hard work after that that that is not as appealing to me because I I because I get so much leverage in that first stage um so I love that part but there are people who love each part you have to get the people together who love each part and that's where the complementary skills comes in but but I love whenever there's a tough challenge that that's when I get excited when I could be juggling in my head all the different ways you could solve a particular problem that really gets my juices flowing and that's what I love to be called into the room thank you very much you've been a great audience you have been listening to the draper Fisher-Jurvis and entrepreneurial thought leader series brought to
