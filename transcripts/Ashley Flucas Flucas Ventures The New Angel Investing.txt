 Who you are defines how you built. This is the OddPattern thought-leaders series brought to you by Stanford E-Corner. Welcome everyone to the final of three special live ETL episodes where presenting this summer before we kick off the fall quarter in late September. I'm Chuck Easley, an associate professor in Stanford's Department of Management, Science, Engineering and faculty member at STVP. And today I'm excited to be joined by Flukas Venture's founder and general partner, Ashley Flukas. Based in West Palm Beach, Florida, Flukas Ventures is a syndicate of around 2,000 angel investors and has invested in more than 200 startups. Ashley also serves as a partner at Jupiter, a Florida-based real estate finance fund with three billion in assets under management. And she's a graduate of Duke University in Harvard Law School. I stumbled across Ashley Syndicate, initially on angel list and saw she was a fellow Duke alum and then also attended that school in Boston, up the river from MIT. It was quickly impressed by the depth of her due diligence and thoughtfulness of her investment memos on startups as well as her advocacy for historically underrepresented groups in tech. So I'm very excited to chat with her here on ETL. Welcome Ashley. Thank you, thank you. So you started out as a lawyer in the real estate business in Florida. And now you're leading a syndicate that has more than 200 startup investments. Can you explain briefly how you got interested in investing in early stage companies and what some of your first steps were? Yeah, so I actually first got the idea that Venture might be something that I wanted to do. About 10 years ago, it just took me forever to act on it. I actually read a book called The Monk in the Rittle by Randy Comissar and he plotted a path that I was like, this is what I want to do. Nikki also went to a school of the river and the starting out as a trajectory as a lawyer and just kind of didn't see it as the path, front path for him. He didn't see his life kind of wanting to follow that linear trajectory and ultimately did a few things within business and tech and then that led him into the startup space. And then as he was kind of describing his life and his day to day and what he was working with, I'm like, I know that's exactly what I want to do. And now I see that there's a path to use this skill set to get there. But I still kind of went about my bit about my business for a while and it took me seven years from having that that of Pimpini to actually act on it. But you know, things happen as they do. So yeah, fast forward. I mean, I originally actually started out as a capital markets lawyer in practice in London for a while before getting involved in real estate. But Candily, I got to a place where I had the means to actually pursue you know, angel investing or venture investing in a meaningful way. And I was thinking about, you know, investments in general. And not just from an alpha and return standpoint, but also, how do I want to spend my time and what do I want to build? And then that venture just came up again. And I thought, all right, I'm going to figure this out. But I was literally, you know, starting from from zero because despite those, you know, school networks, I didn't know anyone attacking. I didn't know anyone in venture, not to mention trying to do this from Florida before it became the new the new kid on the block as far as being a destination for venture. So pretty early on, which was now, I'm now hitting my three year anniversary of my first investment, I had to figure out how do you do this virtually? And how do you kind of do it from a complete cold start? Yeah. So I think that's really interesting. And Randy Komasar's book is great. By the way, I have that as extra credit on one of my courses, the 145. Great, great, great book. So I think a lot of people are going to be interested in this as more and more folks have gotten interested in aware of angel investing. Have any advice in terms of how to establish credibility as an early stage investor or how you were able to do this when, you know, most of your network I assume was originally in the legal and real estate worlds and not so much in tech and venture capital. So any thoughts along those lines? Yeah, so I think the best way to get started and kind of, you know, I mean, obviously I'm sure people chart other courses. So I just have to talk from from my experience not having that tech background, not having the context. You know, I really learned immersive style in terms of learning by doing and the way I literally stepped on for me was doing my homework and thinking at a time it was 2018, but in my mind, the thought was it's 2018. There has to be a way that I can do this from my computer that doesn't involve me trying to like hop on planes to San Francisco and and their New York or wherever the other epicenters were. And eventually just from literally Google stumbled upon Angelus and saw some different, you know, writings about them and different, you know, reputable sources saw that there were deals passing through and that they had a track record of some pretty strong deals, you know, several unicorns actually having passed through the platform. And so I'm like, okay, great. I'm actually going to get started here. And so the first thing, the first things that I did, you can basically, a way Angelus works, you can apply and join a bunch of syndicates and these syndicate leads are putting together deals, deal memos terms, decks and a lot of valuable information. And I must have joined maybe every one of them on the platform. So, I mean, maybe literally, if I look today, I probably back like literally hundreds of syndicates. So my inbox is a mess. But I just, I was just kind of eager and wanted to be a student and my whole thing was everything that someone puts out like, I'm going to read it because the only way to be good and anything is to become fluid in that language. I mean, you know, for example, you know, this is some training, but the difference between a lawyer and a non-lawyer is being fluent in legalese and the concept and understanding kind of like the rules that govern that world. And I figured by analogy that also had to be true adventure. So just kind of like voraciously reading everything that I could get my hands on, even if I saw a deal and it very clearly, at least in the beginning, maybe felt like it wasn't something for me. I still take the time to read everything that I could read, read all the materials, look up things about it. And then in the background, always be looking at things like, okay, well, who are the major players in this space? And then what are their thoughts on different things? Because that's the only, I think the only way, not the segue to be, to really be good at this is you kind of have to have some institutional basing knowledge and understand trends and understand kind of the broader universes, what's out there. And so if you're an individual, you have either digest a lot of information or have a wide network that adjusts a lot of information. So it started out on Angelless looking at a kind of deal flow. But it also took me, you know, kind of biting the bullet and putting my toe in and putting, you know, a lot of my own capital at risk and learning just by being in it, by feeling the highs of seeing deals do well and follow on invests coming in to uncertainty and everything else that comes with angel investing only by taking those first steps. Can you really get started? And for me, the Angelless platform was great because it was kind of a safe environment to do it because it is a little bit more of a passive exercise. There's no obligation to invest in and I could just kind of build and get comfortable over time and then also use that platform to network to reach out to other people who I could see were doing, who were investing in the same deals to the people who were leading the deals. And that's how I formed some of my earliest connections was through, through kind of collisions that happened on the platform until I eventually, I looked up and I was doing them at a clip far greater than what I would have anticipated and spent far more money than I would have anticipated. But I realized, oh, I'm starting to kind of have a track record and even in a short window of time seeing how things evolved with those startups and that gave me confidence to then be a direct investor and start going after deals. So it's an amazing story and the power of tech platforms and angelists in particular these days. I wonder, there's a lot of blurring of the lines these days as well between Angel and BC. Can you talk a bit about how Flucas Ventures works and how the model differs from a traditional venture capital firm? Yeah, so I think what you said was pretty poignant that I definitely think there is a blurring of the lines because I call myself often an angel investor because that feels like the default thing to say as an individual or solo person developing. But if you actually look at my investment activity that that was probably true in the beginning but it's not necessarily true anymore. And there's now just because of just kind of the explosion of emerging managers, the explosion of platforms, the ability for smaller, small for angels to put together checks like things like things like syndicates that there's now an opportunity for someone who might have traditionally been pigeonholed to being just an angel investor, to truly being an overall venture capital investor. So for context, when I first started, it was mostly seed, maybe a little bit of precede, some series A stuff. And then I'm sure as you get involved with my syndicate email from you saying I did last week, I did the series A for Databricks, the series C for Picasso, and a number of later stage deals as well. And so I think of myself as just a venture investor still do a lot of early stuff. And there's still a certain thrill that comes with the discovery and a different set of returns and a different set of framework, you know, one stage versus the other. But like I said, I think because of the explosion and I won't say accidents has been fully democratized. And so it's definitely a work in progress. And then particularly as we think about other communities participating in this asset class, but there's certainly more opportunity where, you know, folks aren't just going on Sandhill Road and talking to the same handful of funds. There's so many ways to get capital capital is being commoditized. So that creates a lot of opportunities for disruptors and folks like myself to sneak into some of these rounds. And so I think, you know, what you can categorize what I was first doing as just, I'm an angel investor. I'm writing, you know, not huge checks checks that are below, you know, and it's relative to everyone what you consider a large check, but checks that are below six figures into companies usually earlier, earlier stage either directly on the cap table or with, or with other angels. And then there's another model, which I then graduated to even though I still do some personal angel investing, which is the syndicating. And so for those who don't, for those who don't know, I'm now targeting a wider range of companies because I can write a bigger check by virtue of pooling capital together. So what does that look like? I diligence, just like I would if I were angel investing, I diligence and opportunity. It's ready to go, but the extra step is I then need to make an argument to folks in my syndicate as to why it's a compelling investment because it's not just my own money at this point. So basically, I'm putting together a memorandum of persuasive writing basically as to why you should invest in an ex company. And basically on a, you know, no obligation basis, but the people in the syndicate, those, you know, that consortium of 2000 different people and family offices and microphones and partners and whoever else, they make a decision if they want to invest alongside of me. I run my process through the angelist platform. So they have a great, kind of a great back end where people can kind of click through and they handle, you know, kind of the logistical process and handling money and all of that. But the gist of it is now I'm somewhat like an angel, but there's now this this, this leverage because instead of writing my check, I can bring the power of a group to a deal. And then that changes the games in terms of deals that I'm able to access and the stage across which I'm able to invest because if you, you might be an amazing person, but if you were typically maybe going earlier stage deals and, you know, maybe you're investing directly and you're investing 10,000, if a company is more mature or if they have, you know, whatever sensitivity is about their cap table being crowded, they're maybe not necessarily going to accept that check from you at past a certain stage. But if you are your same person with your same value ad that you always added smaller stage, but it's now, oh, I have a group of people and we're going to invest a half a million, we're going to invest a million, then it actually becomes easier to access more cap cap tables that way. So now the evolution with the syndicate is being able to invest across all stages. Unlike a venture fund, however, as a syndicate, I do not have captive capital going into any deal. I cannot technically guarantee your state I am going to invest X. Now I have enough experience that when I look at a deal, I can kind of look at it all the variables and I pretty much know within a pretty tight range what I'll be able to deliver on. But at the end of the day, it's not like I have a, like I said, a captive capital of pool funds to write checks from like a venture fund. Other other differences, you know, one of the advantages of being either an angel or a syndicate style investor is, you know, you don't have a lot a number of the requirements that fund us, for example, I don't have to target any type of ownership percentage, which is very freeing because I can just look at every deal on its own and say, is that is that individual deal a deal I would like to be a part of based on whatever my criteria of. And I don't have to kind of wait that against the overall portfolio. Every deal stands on its own. And so that's really evident phases. Secondly, because I'm not a fund, I'm not putting out competing terms, sheets, et cetera. It's almost like you're forget what you call them, but basically like the symbiotic fish that like swim with the sharks and like clean their teeth. You know, I'm not competing with, you know, insert the coin and reason, whoever I, my investment is completely symbiotic. They have no reasons to view me as a threat or reason not to also be on the cat table. So I think you can also kind of wedge into more deals that you maybe could not, if you were even a pretty reputable fund because of some of those restrictions. Not to mention, although, you know, there are a number of funds who are moving really fast these days, when you get to a point of maturity as an angel or as a syndicate and you kind of know what you like. The speed of execution can be, can be, be a bit faster, especially as a solo capitalist, right? There's not necessarily any committee, you're not running things by your partner, like the bureaucracy is kind of out, is kind of out of it. And so, you know, which can be really advantageous when a lot of these deals are very fast moving these days. Yeah, yeah. And so founders, you know, if they like you, you know, that you can deliver X-check, you're doing your diligence, but you don't necessarily have the same processes and time waiting period as some of these funds, that can allow you to kind of sneak in as well. So it creates a lot of flexibility in those access points. You know, the disadvantages, obviously, except for, you know, the solo capitalists or angels who become super angels or have some kind of brand around them is unlike funds, you may not have any kind of brand awareness in terms of getting access to deals, that's something you have to actively work on. Second, you don't have that captive capital. And also, you know, that's a whole different conversation, but the economics also work different. And, you know, you might have a preference one way or another as to fund versus angel versus syndicate. Yeah, this is a whole world that, you know, I think not many people are aware of. And so, you know, it's good to kind of increase the education and the background on these distinctions and the way that angel investing and venture capital is changing as a result of platforms like angel list and syndicates and rolling funds. I want to circle back to some of those ideas that you mentioned a little later about democratizing access. But let's talk a little bit more broadly about angel investing for a moment. So I did a Stanford alumni survey a few years back and we asked all of the alumni about entrepreneurial activities, angel investing, venture capital investments, and found that there were about eight to ten times as many angel investors among the alumni as venture capitalists. And there's some research from the National Venture Capital Association and University of New Hampshire that estimates about 15 times the number of startups receive angel investment relative to venture capital. So of course, as you mentioned, part of that is earlier stage and smaller investments and a larger number of companies. And you were mentioning some of the other distinctions that in terms of the decision making speed and consensus. Can you talk a little bit more about the platforms that are driving these changes in angel investing and angel list in particular? How significant do you think this phenomenon is and what can or can't they do for investors? I think it's very significant. As I kind of mentioned at the beginning, I started doing everything virtually out of necessity because there was no activity going on in Florida and definitely not in my part of Florida. And so I had to figure out how to do things virtually. And so angel list was instrumental in me and me being able to get started. But I think these, you know, angel list is the one that I use the most often in the past. I've looked at other some other platforms. There are a number of them out there and many that are emerging. So you've got things like seed invest and well, Republic, I guess actually is the affiliate of angel list. But you've got these platforms cropping up. And what's powerful about them is it's building on some themes that are now, you know, they were early on some things that we now all accept, which is being able to do things virtually, being able to do things in a distributed global way. They already had the infrastructures that have to do that. So, you know, case in point, something something like my syndicate in a in a normal context, there's no way we could have met but for angel list. And, and you know, someone like me who, you know, I scaled my syndicate from literally zero to now is about 2200 LPs in in 13 months. That would not be possible manually and it would not be possible but for a platform like that. And those platforms, like I said, those platforms are powerful because they have global reach and it's expanding. And then also in particular a platform like angel list because it's also it's also a marketplace, right? In a discovery tool. So yes, they're doing the mechanics and some of the back office stuff behind investing. But it's also allowing folks like me to build a it's a following if you were in a quasi public way. And it's allowing investors to discover people like me who are putting together deals, but it's also allowing people like me who are putting together deals to discover investors. And so, like I said, I don't think there's any faster way to scale it than these platforms. And then when I look at my LP base, I mean, I have folks from literally all over the world, all time zones, all professions. And, you know, from folks who are just, you know, they have, you know, they're doctors, lawyers, engineers, and they're doing some angel investing to partners, adventure funds, the CEOs, CFOs, professors like yourself. And I think these platforms are so huge. And in some ways, we're really just in the first settings because I think about, you know, when I first joined angel lists, you know, three, three years ago, even though I backed a ton of syndicates, they're really only a handful that were really active. And there wasn't a lot of noise kind of on the platform. Now, I like, there's a, and you've probably seen it yourself. There's massive flow refrigeration of new syndicates, new investors. The deal flow has increased exponentially. And I think it's also had a positive impact on the quality of the deals because one thing that everyone has to be careful about as an angel is kind of figuring out this issue kind of around adverse selection, right? So you only see what you see, whether that's in your close that work or platform like angel list. And so if that is the only pool that you're investing from, you have to have some examination of are these actually good opportunities in and of themselves, or am I kind of investing in a vacuum? So when platforms like angel list continue to expand, continue to kind of open up the tent, get diverse fund managers, or whatever you want to call them, syndicate leads, get diverse investors, that drives better deals to the platform. And I think that starts to help help that particular problem. Finally, we've got some some great questions coming in from from YouTube and social media. We'll get to some of those in the Q and A. But before we do that, I wanted to delve in a little bit more to your decision making. Now that we talk about how you got into investing in startups, let's talk about your investing strategy a little bit more. So first of all, I think a lot of people assume that physical proximity to Silicon Valley can be important in terms of staying in the loop on tech and early stage investing. Do you think that not physically being present in a place like Silicon Valley is a detriment? You know, I know in the public equity markets and Warren Buffett often says that being outside of New York, being in Nebraska is an advantage actually. Do you feel like you're able to participate equally in the innovation economy from just about anywhere now? I certainly think that we're in a moment where that's possible. And to give an example, I look at this week actually because I was just curious for myself about, I think it's about 15% of my investments are actually concentrated outside of the US. So we're talking Africa, Latin America, South East Asia, that is literally almost impossible because of being able to do things in a remote way. And I've not found that I feel like a, and I've found that, you know, this has been doing things remote as a powerful way to access those opportunities. And I don't see why that is applicable in the US as well. And pivoting off your example with Warren Buffett, you know, I probably have some bias here because it's the only thing that I know as far as doing business virtually or not being there. One of the epicenters is I think it makes me a better investor in in a number of ways because I think like so many things, it's easy to kind of be caught up in an echo chamber or way of thinking the group think. And so I think, you know, my, in some ways, naivety, but my freshman is my coming from a non-tech background, from not being a part of Silicon Valley, from having a framework of how to look at investments, but it being formed by a fully different set of life experience, from law to how things operated from business perspective and real estate, et cetera. Give me a different framework for how to look at companies that I think, you know, is maybe a little differentiated. And I think I have a little bit of a differentiated voice and I hear founders tell me that as well, even, you know, in doing advising. And I think that it can be pretty potent if you, if you hone on what makes you different from folks who are in those typical geographies and use that to your advantage and don't run away from that and be it and be an individual because I think at the end of the day, being a successful investor is about being able to identify outliers so that it stands to reason that you being an outlier, you being concentrated a waste or you being out away from where folks are concentrated can play into that. Definitely. So I'm curious to dig deeper on that. Do you think there's a filter that you use to vet investments that people in the audience might find unusual or surprising? Do most successful angel investors use the same general set of best practices? Or do you think there's some frameworks that might be somewhat unique to you? I don't know if I would say unique, but I guess a couple of thoughts on that. Again, I'm going to do another book plug and it'll be funny if it's also one that your class is reads. But pretty, probably when I was on like investment number 10, I came across this book called Play Bigger. And it kind of got all into this idea of category creation and outliers and that at the end of the day, singles doubles, that's great, but you're really looking for these companies that only come around so often that generate kind of the massive returns for the industry. And how do you look at identifying those? And so it's a little different, I guess like I said, like if you're investing later stage, but early on, for me, it's like it's almost like reading a heat map for some of the signals and this book kind of gets into it. And so the thing that I probably do that's a little different is a lot of venture funds and a lot of investors are operators. And I think a lot of times with operators, they get obsessed with a product or they sometimes get to obsessed with the team or they think about how they as an operator would run the business. And they're too zoomed in on that instead of kind of seeing the forest for the trees and the things that, you know, regardless of, you know, besides maybe like deep tech or biotech, but regardless of the sector, the things that need to hold true for a company to be great. And for me, I kind of actually look at the product last, this is the thing, the things that I'm not, it's, I'm like interested in intellectually, but from an investment standpoint, I'm looking at, you know, things around, and for me, my number one thing is distribution and kind of go to market and doing something really novel around that or showing that you've got strong channels there. That's number one thing that I care about more than anything because a product that is not truly revolutionary, you could have a consumer product, for example, mattress companies, exercise companies, and there were billions of billions of dollars, not because they necessarily had an idea that was going to change humanity, but they had brilliant playbooks around distribution. And that's what leads to phenomenal returns. And similarly, there are a million brilliant ideas right now happening on Stanford's campus that could maybe change humanity, but if they, the teams haven't figured out how to distribute and scale that, you know, nobody, nobody will ever see it. And so distribution is one of the big things for me, but there's a few other things like that. And I'm so focused on answering those questions first before I even allow myself to get excited about kind of what the underlying product is. And then of course, I diligence that and want to go around on that. But I think I work from the outside in and a lot of people work from the inside out. And I think that's what differentiates me. And as I look, you know, at some of my companies that are doing pretty well, and, you know, I'm starting to have exits now. And even, you know, much earlier than I expected considering that this is, this is year three. But, you know, two of my one company that just listed on NASDAQ and one that will soon one, ex-Aus Trucks, the other Bicarious surgical. And we were talking robotic surgery and electric trucks. What does that have to do with anything that I know whatsoever. But when I remember when assessing those investments, it wasn't, I could never possibly have, you know, a deep technical understanding of any of those things. And there are probably people who did who passed on them because they thought they knew more than they did. But what I could understand were, like I said, from that outside in approach, were all the things that were flashing to me. Like, this is going to be a big deal. And I went with that. It wasn't kind of blinded so much on the actual technical, technical side of things. And I see that coming to fruition a lot. Now don't get me wrong. There are spaces where I think I have more direct knowledge, like Fentech and PropTech. And then I can get kind of more critical in those areas. But, yeah, definitely with your legal and real estate background. But it's an interesting point, especially with regards to what you said earlier about, you know, you're looking for outliers and things that are going to be, you know, the tail end of the distribution. So let me transition. Obviously, angel investing can be risky. And Scott Shane at Case Western has a book full-sgold that points out the data across the US and the aggregate that shows that a small minority of angel investors generate the lion's share of the returns. And a lot of angel investors do pretty poorly. So for those in the audience, you know, if I'm interested in doing some angel investing, how might I figure out if I really have the skills to properly diligence companies and not just make my money back, but ideally generate returns that are going to outpace the public markets? Or with syndicates and angelists now, is it more about diligence in the lead rather than the individual companies? All great questions and observations. And the few points of view on this, the first thing that I'll say to anybody in the audience is yes, you are qualified to do this and do quite well. What separates the folks who do quite well and the folks who don't is one word and I'll stand by this, which is access. I don't think people who are necessarily making these great returns are any smarter than anyone else in this audience or have some crystal ball because a lot of this is educated guessing. If you're investing at a seed stage company and you said you knew that they were going to be worth five billion, you are lying. You had some clues, some things, some that in your gut, or you just randomly didn't got lucky. Luck is another part of it as well. And there's a lot of egoists in this field who don't want to admit that access and luck are a big part of it. But I don't think if you put in the time, like I said, to learn the language, to learn the trends, to learn the players, to pay attention, what's happening on a macro level, as well as what's going on in that company specific industry. I think as an generally intelligent person, you can make good decisions, but you have to solve for the access problem. The other thing you have to solve for as an individual angel, and we were kind of talking about this earlier with adverse selection. It's the adverse selection, which is a corollary, what I just said. But it's also figuring out where your biases are. And that's something that I still have to do with myself now, and that I try to do very early, which is why do certain things get me really excited? Why do I have fear of certain investments, etc. And really dig into that because, you know, you could get lucky if you invest in your neighbor and you know, you know, built a air table or something. But the odds are really not that good. So you have to think about, you have to think about all of that. And sometimes it's not just, you have to, like I said, you kind of have to zoom out and understand like how wide of a net in my casting, what is the quality of these things. But you only, like I said, I think you do that through some of the things that I said earlier. And so for me, on top of trying to hone those deals and figure out what defines a company that does well to hopefully be able to make more choices, the other things are, I think, to be successful in this, in some ways it's not all too different from public equities in that I believe in diversification. You know, I'm a journalist. Not everybody is going to take that point of view. So that's strictly my point of view. But I think if you, if you saw for the access problem, which I could talk about, but you're investing kind of broad, about basket, almost like public equities, where you're across some different sector stages, possibly even geographies, things that run counters cyclical, you're ultimately going to build diversification is still always the most important rule of investing. And I don't think that changes just because you're dealing in private markets. And so I saw that bear out during the pandemic with, you know, some companies that were hurt, but because I've had this kind of really diverse portfolio, so many did incredibly well because I wasn't anchored to kind of one to one thing. And then on the access point, you know, it is, if you don't have the fortune of of, of, of had coming in with those networks, like I think that I'm an example that you can build them if you want to. And I'm not even a natural extrovert. So I'm an introvert. So, you know, it's about, it's about want to and me understanding that in the day, there are certain folks who are getting most of the returns and doing the same deals. And so leveraging platforms like Angelus, doing events, you know, talking to people, joining communities, doing angel fellowships, whatever you need to do to build your tribe, the more people in your tribe, the greater probability that you're going to have access. Because it's not about just, you know, being brilliant and being able to spark, you know, spot the next, we're in Airbnb, it's, you have to be invited to the deal in the first place. So that's the number one thing you first have to solve for, but it's not, it's not insurmountable. Right. So there's a question related to the impacts of the pandemic that I'm going to get to from the Q&A in just a moment. But I wanted to ask one last question before I turn to the Q&A, which is, you know, from from the other side of the table, how should entrepreneurs be approaching investors that might be running syndicate similar to yours or just angels in general? Are there approaches that might need to be different, have things changed due to the pandemic, and a lot more deals happening virtually? What advice for entrepreneurs would you have approaching investors? I would say, you know, the advice for entrepreneurs definitely kind of depends on where we are in a macro moment, but the moment we're in right now is a better time to be an entrepreneur because there is so much powder out there. And like I said, it's not just the institutions, it's down to syndicates and individuals and solo capitalists. So it's a really powerful time to be a founder because valuations are eye popping, capital is flowing, there are more sources and ever to get capital from. So it's a great time to be a founder. And so I guess my advice around that is, it's got almost like in real estate when it's a buyer or seller market because it's a founder's market right now is that you can kind of really take stock. And it's a question that I actually a lot of times when I'm talking about founders is, is, is, is, and it gives me insight into them as to thinking about how they're constructing their cap table is that you don't have to necessarily pursue it in a traditional way. And you can be, and I'm seeing a lot more founders who are thinking about value ad, but not as, you know, not just as an empty phrase. What do you actually need beyond money because this is a market where you can require it? And, you know, yes, all the great funds, you know, from a brand and standpoint, from a resource standpoint are great, but there are folks, there are individual angels, there are syndicates, there are investment clubs, there are other vehicles where they can also, especially early, they can also give you money, but they can introduce you directly to customers, they can help you with hires, even though their checks may be smaller. If anything for that reason, it's probably more meaningful, the money is probably more meaningful to them. And they're usually going to be probably even more enthusiastic and, and way more focused on what you're doing. So I think for founders, it's being thoughtful about who you want to work with, who you want to have a relationship and realizing that the options are greater than ever now. So that definitely some some good advice. Let me turn to the Q&A. We've got some good questions here from the audience. The first one that I wanted to ask you, how has the pandemic changed your approach and or the types of startups that you've invested in? And also they wonder, is there anything you would have done differently if you could go back in time? Good good good questions and if I forget any piece of that, please. The pandemic was actually my aha moment for wanting to build a syndicate and invest in a far greater clip. That probably owes a bit to again, kind of the real estate background where the idea of distress and trouble is the absolute best time to be an investor. If you have the capital because you're going to get some deals that you maybe have no business doing, you're going to get some discounts and a lot of people in the competition is going to be way less because people are going to be on the sideline. So it was actually the pandemic that inspired me to get really aggressive and start trying to build and scale what I'm doing and invest in a lot more deals. Now with that said, you had to think of the pandemic like what's going to be short term affected versus what's going to be long term affected and nobody is going to be 100% right and predicted that. So in the short term, even though there's deals to be had, I'm not investing in things or even though I absolutely love to travel, not investing around things in travel, for example, because I just really don't know how that's going to be impacted and so that's kind of a scary place to invest in. But by the same thing, token, things that I think have been accelerated and aren't going back or certain things around e-commerce, for example. So that's a sector that I've really ramped up on. Fentech is a sector I've really ramped up on. Cyber because of those other two ramping up, I think actually brought that along as well. Another sector I've really ramped up on. And then there's some that are more ambiguous, right? So there's a host of things now that are kind of servicing remote work, for example. And I'm still very cautious around that because I think no one really knows what's going to happen when hopefully the pandemic is behind us in terms of, how people are going between office and home. If people are still going to want to hop on virtual events as much, if in real life is a possibility. So it's not why I won't avoid the category, but I'm cautious around it. So I really try to think of categories in terms of what do I think is here? And there's no going back even as things return to normal or things that I want to put up in until there's just a little bit more data. And then the second half of that question was about anything that you would have done differently. Having the benefit of hindsight either in terms of getting into angel investing or of course I imagine it's easy to in retrospect pick sectors or startups you wish you would have invested in. But yeah, you know, I mean philosophically, I'm not really a regrets person. Like I think that you are who you are because you're kind of the sum total of your experiences. And so any mistakes I've made, any opportunities that I didn't get in or take advantage of, that's how I learned. And so I would never want to change anything because I'm very comfortable with where I am now. The only thing that I might say and then my advice to people, the only thing that I think that I really could have done differently or that anyone can can end up doing is, you know, I could say I first had the idea to do this 10 years ago and I waited seven years to start. Now granted, I don't know when angel first came into existence or technically what would have been feasible for me to actually when it would have been feasible for me to truly first start, but it was probably sooner than three years ago. And so my biggest thing to myself and I try to apply this going forward and tell other people is is get started. You know, there's a million reasons why you can tell yourself you're not qualified to do it or why it would be hard or why you can't start. And once you get into it and you begin to figure it out bit by bit, you realize it's actually it's feasible, it's quite possible and you'll only wish that you've done it sooner once you once you start to see that. Nice. We've got a question about your take on NFTs. Right. Any thoughts on that? The blockchain space more broadly? Yeah, so you know, I'm invested across so many sectors, but that is the area that I have the least amount of exposure in though I did, I guess my first investment kind of adjacent to the space and a company called US Bitcoin mining, which is kind of doing like green Bitcoin mining here in the US and they're doing extraordinarily, extraordinarily well. You know, it's interesting. I think it's you know, folks who are a bit older than me probably haven't even greater perspective, but when you're around this new technology and these new ideas and you don't know quite know what to make of it and you know, different people are making a ton of money and some people are losing money, I've said to myself and I think you go into yourself to explore what that is because I mean, it's a bit cliche. I'm not the first person to say it, but ignoring blockchain, ignoring crypto, ignoring NFTs would be like being in the 90s and pretending to ignore the internet and just focusing on you know, whatever conglomerates were around at that time and so you do not want to be that person with that said because it's so new, because there's a lot of noise around it, I do think it can be difficult to be discerning and so my whole thing and I'm in a place like I said, I literally, I pulled the trigger on my kind of first investment in this space. This is probably about three weeks ago is kind of approaching almost like I approached Angelus in the beginning, which is just getting educated, keeping a pulse on it, following people who I know who are smart in this space and dipping my toe in and letting that kind of be the beginning of things, but we're an interesting moment and so what I will say is I think we all kind of, if you're a curious person, if you're interested in investing, you owe it to yourself to at least not ignore it because you may regret it because it could be NFTs could be 1.0 into what is truly going to be the thing, but you kind of need to crawl before you can walk.
