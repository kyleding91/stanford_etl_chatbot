 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. It is my pleasure to introduce Josh MacHour. Josh is an incredibly impressive fellow and I'm sure you will agree with me at the end of this hour. He is the founder and chief executive officer of Explorum Med and also a venture partner at New Enterprise Associates. I got a chance to get to know Josh because he's the co-founder of the bi-design program at the Med School and teaches over there as well. But one of the things that is most impressive about him is that he has four over four dozen patents in a huge range of medical fields including cardiology, ENT, general surgery, drug delivery, orthopedics and urology and he's also been involved with starting six different companies. He's going to tell us today about the perfect storm in MedTech and he's going to use his experiences in his own companies as a backdrop. Thanks so much and welcome Josh. Thank you, Tina. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Thanks for coming out for this. Appreciate it. So I'm just going to walk through a little bit of background and talk about a recent company experience and then really kind of hit on to the big topic which is some of the challenges that we are facing right now in MedTech specifically and kind of try to get people active in this space to kind of get a little activism going and maybe help reverse the course of some of the changes. So this is a diagram of my background all in one big picture. Starts off with a background in engineering and business and medicine and kind of got my first experiences in business at Pfizer working as first a technology analyst and then ultimately starting a in-house incubator at Pfizer which is called fresh tech with a PF because it was PF for Pfizer. And our mission was to really identify a process for innovating new medical technologies and to ask the question is it possible to innovate inside of a big company and we discovered that the answer was yes it is possible to do that. It's possible to have a reproducible process that one can use and if you follow that process you will create new ideas that are pretty impactful. The challenge in a big company comes when those ideas are actually created how do they actually wind up becoming fully funded and kind of allowed to exist. That's where the challenge comes. So it's not about the challenges not how to find and create them. That can be done quite routinely at the process but the other elements are things that culturally in a big business are the big challenge. Once I left Pfizer after getting an MBA Columbia I went on to meet and was introduced to John Nier at NEA that was 15 years ago and we sat in a burger place in and out over in the city and sketched out on a napkin what experiment was going to be as an incubator. At that point there really was no med tech incubator and incubator concept. Most people were considering where you build a building and make a bunch of offices and then people come in and use the conference room. This was a very different concept where we would basically allocate money to the pursuit of verifying, finding and validating an idea that could become a company. Then once we throw in everything that we could add it to make sure that it could stand on its own as a company we would start the company with the goal of reducing the likelihood of failure and try to fail fast inside the incubator and then get these things out earlier. That's basically what I've been doing for the last 15 years is producing medical device companies, three of which have been acquired at this point and along the way ran into Paul Yacht and together we created the ByDesign Innovation Program and I'll talk a little about that. In the broad spectrum this entire phase of my life from Pfizer onwards let's say 20 years last 20 years I've really been addressing this singular issue which is to make people try to rethink about how they think about who an innovator is. If you think of what's the first thing that comes to your mind when you think of an innovator you will probably think of somebody with crazy hair, locked away in a basement or a garage working tinkering on something, probably not very good social skills and somewhat removed from society and then all of a sudden a brilliant vision comes to them, they build it and before you know it they have some amazing new invention. And unfortunately that's what we've been kind of led to believe our society has brought us down this path but it couldn't be further from the truth in terms of what it's all about. And so the real concept is that we're all innovators and we all have the potential to innovate and some of you are actually going to be really really good at it and maybe you don't know it yet because you haven't had the opportunity to train to be one. And so if you can identify that obviously some will be more skilled than others there's obviously some natural talent like with any kind of sports or whatever you know I'm not the best basketball player even though I know how to throw one. But the concept is if you can develop it in people you can teach them they can get better they can learn that discipline and with that discipline just become really excellent at it. And we've demonstrated this for multiple years and people have come in who had no patents before but really had a desire and basic fundamental education to do it come out and become real innovators and start companies and do great things and they do it better than they might have if they were not being trained. So important elements, access to the customers, the right environment you got to have an environment that accepts failure, accepts the fact that we don't always get it right the first time and embraces that in the pursuit of the ultimate solution to a problem. A good team, the right people people that can work together and of course the right amount of resources. And in just its basic form this is the process and I think the most interesting thing about this process that people don't really think about is that it starts with deciding what you want it to be before you've invented it and that's kind of a different concept for some people they kind of think well I got to think of an idea let's see what it should be but actually if you think about what it needs to be before you invented then you'll know when you found it and starting with that strategic structure it's got to be a business of a certain size it's got to address a certain population it's got to have intellectual property protection it's got to be able to you know be achievable within a certain time frame whatever your parameters are it's going to be different for an individual versus a big company versus a small company. So those are all different but when you figure out what that is for you it really sets a framework that you can act on. The next fundamental step is another one that seems relatively obvious but it's amazing how few people do it which is to focus on the need and when we say focus on the need I see some of my fellows here in the room they know that that what that means it sounds so simple to do of course you're going to look at a need and then you're going to kind of solve it but there's a there's a discipline to that. Because as human beings we desire to not be in an uncertain place we want to have certainty we want to know what the answer is we want to run to the answer in fact what soon as we think of the first idea that we can think of which usually happens as soon as we start getting exposed to problems we come up with that and then that's the only thing that's filling our mind is the solution but what happens then is you fall in love with that solution you can't get it out of your mind you can't change you can't think of anything else. So the discipline is actually to not invent but to actually focus on the problem and to spend the appropriate amount of time really digesting that problem living in that problem understanding the parameters the where is where where are the needs of this problem what are the what's the specification that needs to be met to solve this problem the best and when you've developed that discipline you're able to release yourself from this desire to get to certainty quickly and you can live in that place where you can really see the problem for what it is and that's what we've done in every one of the companies that we've started we've been in that place and as a result we've created something that other people have never thought of before and so that's that is where the the whole process value is the rest of it's all straightforward once you really have that problem specced out brainstorming is easy I mean in fact you came up with so many ideas you couldn't believe it but here's what we got going into we got a great specification of what it needs to be once it's invented and that helps us very quickly figure out which was the best idea and we are able to divorce ourselves from just loving one idea and move on to multiple move on to the one that's right okay so we've reduced this into a much more elaborate process which is detailed in the book that we that came out we that we put out a couple of months ago and that we use as a textbook for the bi-design course here at Stanford but I just mentioned this as a backdrop because it really is a fundamental aspect of you know how I've gotten to where I am today and you know kind of what we try to train people to do so that's the background part let's move on to the entrepreneurial story part and every time I look at this picture it's kind of really a fun picture for me to look at it's John Chang's first day at what was then called explorer med NC1 new company one and there we are we look a whole lot younger and and definitely a lot less battle scars you know wrinkles on her face etc and amazingly that was only six years ago but still it's amazing what what a business can kind of extract from your life but there we are you know first day on the job we don't know what we're going to do we have no idea this is the first day blank sheet of paper and that's something that's some part of my model it's a little different than other incubator models as I start with a person so my whole you know approach is that person is a fundamental basis around which we build a company they have to be trained they have to have the right experience they have to be ready they have to have been successful they have to know how to get a product from concept to commercialization before but maybe this is they've never started company before they've never you know done it on the round before but they're ready and and they've got the right kind of heart and soul ethics you know all those things that are really important that go into someone who who can be this role and that's the role of project architect's form it so there we are first day kind of fun little memory there so this is what we kind of came up with as we began to try to understand the needs of the area of chronic sinusitis that became an area of interest because I was a chronic sinusitis sufferer and I was very interested in trying to find a solution but you know when I thought about chronic sinusitis I thought about itis must be an infection probably addressable by drugs so I didn't even expect that we'd find any device solutions and being a device person you know I thought that that was what I want to do so you know my criteria was it has to be a device solution because if it was going to be a pharma thing bio pharma or what have you that's not my expertise and I knew that that wasn't what it was going to do but that didn't stop me with you know I just said I'm going to learn about this thing and see what it needs to be there's a lot of people outside but there's lots of seeds available come on in so we came up with this structure okay we came up with an engineering engineering concept of sinusitis and what you have here is we realize that there's two components there's a bony scaffold which really supports the the the mucos of that line the sinuses and a dynamic component which is the mucosal surface and that mucosal surface can swell and if you've got a really tight passageway because the bony structure and then the mucosal swells well the whole thing blocks off and a cascade of problems start happening and you get a cute sinusitis with all that swelling in certain people who have that certain anatomical structure they progress into a chronic sinusitis and they can have pain for years like I did I had you know a consistent chronic pain you know inside your head every day wake up in the morning go to sleep at night and all you're thinking about is how do I manage my day so I could just kind of get through it and not have a headache and so I wasn't even I wasn't even that bad but people would say to me you know you you're you're not bad enough for surgery and I was thinking to myself how bad do you need to be to get surgery because this certainly feels pretty bad so that was the motivation for you know a Clarence and you know what we came up with and this is kind of the aha picture okay we spend a lot of time looking at these knees trying to understand it and I looked at this picture out of the corner of my eye and it looked like an angiogram now for those of you that aren't into medicine an angiogram is a is a a situation where you're injecting a contrast agent something that can be that actually prevents the penetration of x-rays into a structure within the body and you're sending x-rays through and I was as a result you get this pattern which is where which is basically showing all the structures where the contrast agent isn't but you see this pattern of the blood vessels so it looks a little bit like a tree you know because the blood vessels kind of branch and you can see where the blood vessels go and you can also see where they're kind of tight and where they they have little little lesions inside of blood vessel and that's the basis of upon which they direct angioplasty catheters to go put those little balloons in there and dilate those tight spots when I looked at this I said you know I wonder whether it's possible to put a flexible catheter like a balloon catheter that they use for you know coronary angioplasty into the sinuses and do the same kind of thing could it could you could you dilate the sinuses like that and so that was the idea for a clarinet we tried it it worked and you know I'm going to fast forward and you know this is what we were able to accomplish in the last six years we were able to take that concept to commercialization in 18 months so from we we basically nine months in we were in in patients nine months later we were through the FDA and we had it on the market and found lots of patents we're able to raise a lot of money to do this took a lot of money to do it we've created a lot of publications a lot of clinical data we today we've treated over a hundred thousand patients now we treat about three hundred and fifty patients a day worldwide revenue rate greater than a hundred million a year three hundred seventy five jobs and and it was acquired for actually eight hundred twenty million net of cash seven eighty five so they had they there was cash on the books and that they that's the published amount but it was actually twenty million for the acquisition of the business so when you when you look at that you you say well geolishirlix easy but man do we have challenges and that's the part that I don't think a lot of people realize the challenges that we have and the challenges that that the business still has quite honestly um the biggest one was the one that I was uh the most disappointed in being a physician myself was the physicians unwillingness to change um you know I kind of had this idealistic view that you come up with a technology really makes people better it's easy to use patients like it outcomes are better everything's you know you save tissue you save you save the patient it's all good how can somebody not love that and uh and the answer is well because that's not the way people were trained to do it and that's not there isn't reams and reams of data on it it's new and so uh why should I do that and you know get out of my ore so that was quite interesting um more more to to beyond that the next thing that was somewhat disappointing were the harsh tactics that were used to try to undermine the company and the uh and the uh and the way and the struggles that we had with some of the leadership was was quite and we still have quite honestly um and uh and I did the piece that I didn't understand going into this and you know usually have this matrix of things you've got to check that box check that box I didn't have a box I'm trying to understand the politics within the society itself that was not something I really realized was an important element of trying to navigate a technology I guess in retrospect it makes sense it should but I just didn't think it mattered um the answer is it matters you got to know who's who certain people need to be involved uh because if they're not they get angry and uh you know they're people and and uh and people have emotions and that's that's the way it is so so I think you know a lot of ways are uh you know early uh fervor and excitement and fousiasm was really misunderstood by a lot of that clinical community in the early days and there were a lot of misunderstandings that really delayed us and we and and because of this we really in in the early days I think we struggled to survive um and that was uh that was part of it so and we haven't really solved these issues they still continue and and they will continue and this is a this isn't just ENT its other space as well it's it's something that you if you decide to innovate in this space you need to be aware of there's well entrenched ways that things are done and you think about how you compellingly make those changes not just with the clinical argument but with other arguments as well that get changed to happen so but when I look back at what our keys to success were and they were you know the idea worked we're able to navigate the FDA process it was predictable uh investors had confidence in our patents uh they they knew that uh eventually we would get protection um and then that would be powerful that we could enforce those patents um we could we had already access to financing um able to maintain great clinical advice we work closely with our our clinical advisors get them in the lab pay them appropriately incentivize them appropriately to take time out of their practices to spend with us we were able to go into an acidity scenario where the reimbursement was already there in place for the procedure uh and we were able to quickly establish it and kind of get it covered under that umbrella uh we were able to track great people and we worked really hard and never gave up but I want to look at this list and I think about some of the challenges that now face the medtech industry this is what's at risk is the opportunity to do this again um given what has happened within the last just a couple years just within the last two years there've been some dramatic things that have happened and that's what I'm really going to talk about for the rest of the talk here and hopefully try to get some of you who care about this and want to be in this space to take some action and help make things better I mean we are essentially facing what is essentially a perfect storm in medtech there it's the global financial crisis it's the certain aspects of health care form it's not all bad but there's certain aspects that are quite damaging for our industry uh limitations on the ability to interact with physicians certain aspects of patent reform that are quite scary uh changes at the FDA potentially devastating and uh and a broken reimbursement system that really penalizes things that are new and and potentially better and puts a really high bar in their success so that's what we're going to talk about so let's go through each one one by one first thing is this whole global financial crisis has impacted the VCs you've probably heard about this lots of times from other speakers and as a result venture funds are really funding the companies that they already have they there's less and less opportunity for new companies so you know this is the backdrop you know what's going to make this better over time will be you know the park the markets have to turn around that people have to believe again and that that will happen but I really put the slide up just kind of lay the backdrop as for all the other things that are going on right now in our industry the reimbursement climate as I mentioned it's exceptionally challenging I mean most people don't realize that there are three fundamental elements to actually get paid for medical technology first there has to be a code so if you've invented something new there's no code well that could take several years just to get a code well once you get a code you've been thinking hey we're home free ready to go no now you have to have coverage people have to agree that they're going to cover that coded procedure in their payment system and private insurers what's their motivation I mean they they you know that's extra money that they have to pay out so they're going to set a high bar CMS same thing I mean they're worried about expense so they're going to really they're really going to put some significant scrutiny on deciding that they're going to cover it so now once they you cross that barrier you've got coding and coverage well what are they going to pay sometimes they decide to pay less than the price of your device where does that leave you so you got to fight these battles every step of the way that's what's ahead and sometimes you get a code that is like a category three code there's different types of codes you get a category three code you are in a box you're just like it a penalty box for potentially years because it basically says you're experimental and don't come back for a certain amount of time and it's basically I mean imagine you know the venture people paying while you're trying to go through this process it's quite devastating so that's already there I mean this these are things that were already there we were already dealing with them but in the context of some of the other things I'm going to mention again another layer of complexity that people have to realize how difficult it is to navigate a new medical technology let's talk about patent patent reform a little bit I think here through lots of lobbying efforts of you know myself and are you know Ed Brighton and folks of the Foundry and you know really our MedTech community as a whole we have made some major progress progress here I think the change in the patent commissioner to David Kappell has been a major breath of fresh air he has a great group that he's brought with him he understands the importance that intellectual property pays plays for MedTech especially and he's been very very very clever in the way that he's trying to go about it and so I feel much better about this slide than I did let's say a year ago when the previous patent commissioner I think really in his mind was really hoping that the way that he would deal with the patent bat log is just those damn inventors stop inventing things you know we could get rid of this bat log you know that's a big problem it's just too inventive so you know that's not a good that's not a good way to go for America healthcare reform so you know there was lots of uncertainty well now we have some certainty and really as a whole healthcare reform for the MedTech industry you know is isn't that neutral I mean it's most of it I don't think it's going to help you know promote new technologies or innovation I don't think it's going to hurt except for three very important issues the big one is this medical device tax now most of people every time you hear people complaining about taxes you say well you know everybody's got to pay taxes you know too bad but let me explain why this particular tax is exceptionally damaging for innovation in MedTech and I think you'll appreciate why people are so upset about it it's not a tax on profits it's a tax on revenue the other thing to recognize is that when you have a MedTech company you could be making oh well not making you could be you have revenue of 2550 75 million dollars in revenue and still not be profitable because of the costs of actually getting the people in there to train appropriately paying for the regulatory clinical studies all of this stuff is expensive and so with a Claren we did not see any dollar of profitability until we approached 85 million dollar run rate on a yearly basis and so when you think about that wow that means that venture people investors are going to be writing checks to the government for the privilege of investing in medical technology so it's it's really devastating not only do MedTech companies now need to raise money to pay for development get the sales going all that kind of stuff now they're going to have to raise money to pay the government to be allowed to have the privilege of not making any money for the until they you know reach profitability just isn't going to work so we got to fix that one big time um comparative effect of this I think we have yet to understand what that is potentially scary for novel technologies if they're going to say all right you fledgling technology let's compare you against what we've been doing against the past 40 years when it hasn't even really fully developed yet that could be really scary but we don't know what that is hopefully it'll be executed in in a light and way with respect to novel technology um payment reform etc let's talk about the sunshine act which is a component of real healthcare form so you can understand why people are a little upset about this now I believe in transparency I think transparency is a good thing to know what's going on but at what level what level really matters right now the current law says any mid-tech company that provides something of value could be lunch could be a two starbucks coffees of ten dollars or more has to be recorded and published on a website for every physician interaction that is in that category that means that you think about the administrative costs of that and who's going to pay for that it's going to be the healthcare system we're trying to reduce costs here and so there's an obsessive view there's an obsessive focus on these cash as a motivator but ten dollars come on give me a break I mean ten dollars is not going to make doctors forget what the right thing to do is okay we could set a little higher limit might be a little bit more less burdensome this is exceptionally burdensome and burdensome burdensome some burdensome okay but but here's the big thing that really irks me because whoever came up with his law has obviously not stepped foot into an academic situation where there's no money but believe me there's lots of conflicts and power and prestige and political power and and being right could be like such a much bigger motivator than ten bucks that that's what get that's what people forget and unfortunately what has happened is anyone who has some kind of financial interest has been removed from the debate about new technologies yet all the people who have all sorts of academic conflicts and political conflicts are still in the debate and that's really concerning and as patients and consumers of healthcare you know we should be worried about this because guess what we fought a lot of physicians on the way to build a clarinet who did not really see the vision who did not like it they did not want things to change they liked it the way it was they thought it was a problem they didn't believe that the technology could work and they they really tried to stop it imagine if if the only people who could decide on the future of novel technology were people like that that's what we you know maybe facing if we don't take it a better appreciation of what real conflict is and instead of eliminating conflict of interest we manage conflict of interest we acknowledge it we expose it you have a relationship you got to say it all that type of strange transparency but if we try to cross you know make a line then the only people who will be making decisions will be those that are not informed and that's very dangerous for patients so the FDA are you depressed yet here we go you know the FDA's mission is a valid one it's to provide reasonable assurance of safety and efficacy and to promote innovation sometimes people forget about the second bullet here promote innovation what does that mean and how is it being interpreted now when they when it was all set up there was supposed to be a a least burdensome standard upon which the this would be implemented so that companies would be allowed to survive because one could try to eliminate all possible risk and kill any possibility that any of invasions is going to survive because there's always a risk it's almost unavoidable you can't eliminate all risk so what's happened is when after Obama was elected a letter was sent to Congress and Obama by a group of disgruntled employees at CDRH claiming that the management of CDRH is in cohoots with business and that they're not making the right decisions etc and so there's been a lot of scrutiny and in fact a lot of the people named in that memo are now gone and I don't really and I there was an investigation and I think the investigation showed that not there was no wrongdoing by those people but what's happened is there's now a wave of fear there's a wave so so which you have to realize is the people that review these incoming applications at the FDA generally are well-meaning scientifically oriented people who recently have exited school and they have you know full of ideals and they they feel of tremendous responsibility for society that they need to protect everybody and but they don't have a lot of experience and they don't have a lot of exposure to the real risks and benefits that patients patients and physicians face every single day and how willing some patients and some physicians might be to take certain risks and and we look we do it all the time we accept certain amount of risk in all of our activities in life and especially when we need a therapy we accept some of these risks we believe me if we took a poll right here we should how many people would like to avoid all possible risk and what the impact of that would be on the innovation and the opportunity to be exposed to new therapy when we just need to be educated and today we're educated better than ever the internet is you know you can get so much information on the internet you know an article comes out in the New York Times it's all over the world and practice the patterns can change overnight so we're not dealing with a situation where once this thing is released you know if it's not right it can't be fixed it can't be recalled it can't be dealt with there is out those opportunities but because of this whole thing there's been a whole desire you know there should be no fast path you know that people view this 510k process as a fast path it it isn't a fast path it's it's it is faster than PMA hopefully but it doesn't mean that it hasn't been scrutinized many 510k's go through a clinical trial so you know this is there's there's a lot of misperceptions and I think as a society here's here's the message you know for for you and whoever's listening we got to decide what we want we want new medical technologies if we want to see progress and innovation we have to accept a certain amount of risk it comes with the unknown of something new but that doesn't mean you have to get that therapy but should we prevent others that want to get an exposure to it should we prevent everyone from having the opportunity to get exposed to it how much of a barrier do we want to create in front of our ability to gain access to new technology to have that opportunity even though we know it might not work even though in my we know it might not work for everybody we want to understand what those risks are we want to understand what the what the safety balance is but let I think we don't want to have a organization standing our way of access to what people in the rest of the world really have access to and that's what's going on right now many many many technologies available overseas that are not available here and it's just because of our process so you know this is an issue so we discussed this the big issue is that and you know my concern and even sharing this with you is that you know if we don't fix it then the bright minds the creative people who are looking to build their careers we're not going to be able to continue to bring them into our special we've been so fortunate for so many years to have so many great smart people innovating and creating fantastic technologies that are going to advance patient health and we've experienced that benefit and it's evident by the the improvements that we see every day the the advances you know the ability for people to live longer healthier lives we we've come to enjoy all that that's been based on a foundation of innovation I don't think we want to give that up so and I don't think we want innovators and the bright people going in other places we want them to you know continue to come to the industry so so why should we care you know many people think you know we've had it yeah I this is a almost a quote I want to tribute it to somebody but we've had enough innovation in medicine you know we're done you know it's like John Lennon all the songs have been written you know you know what maybe some people believe maybe there's a you know a little bit in the background maybe if we you know knock out the medtech industry we can save health care costs you know some people said that well it's all this technology that's causing all this expense you know let's get those CT scanners out of the hospital you know they believe that innovation innovation is driving up the costs of medical care and you've probably heard this you might even it's okay you might even believe it I'm gonna give you some facts maybe we could change your mind first of all medtech is a strong economic forcing the United States it is responsible for a tremendous number of jobs very high paying high skilled jobs okay but it's very fragile you know when you think of medtech you might think Johnson Johnson metronic some big company Zimmer but the reality is medtech is 80 percent small companies little companies they make a widget connects up to an in you know inflation device it connects up to a you know a dilator big lots of little companies with with small numbers of people in them and funding from venture capitalists looking for that investment that return ultimately for their efforts it produces a reasonable chunk of the GDP I mean it's small but the important thing is it's one of the few industries that we have in the US where we have a net trade surplus we're actually exporting more medical device we're the only country that actually exports more medical devices out so it's it's one of the positive industries that we have in the US and the impact is quite significant for our own population as well as populations across the world and most importantly medtech can't possibly be blamed for the increasing health care costs met if you look at health care spending in the United States it's greater than two trillion medtech spending on medical technology as a whole is 5 percent of all health care spending so where's all the rest of it coming from you know if it's not the big CT scanners and the disposable instrumentation or all of us where's it going it's services it's people it's it is jobs actually you know it's nurses and doctors and and you know and you know administrators etc now you know I think that some of this can be you know if you look at where the inefficiencies where's the opportunity to save money probably on the IT side you know maybe we don't need you know three people to touch a document before it finally gets to the insurance company you know things like that it's not medtech it's not the technology's not to blame it's easy to point to because you got a big you know two million dollar CT scanner out there but that isn't the big part of the costs and that's what people don't understand and it's you know it's very unfortunate so you know what what what what have we accomplished is it's tremendous and we you know if you think about the human suffering that medtech has actually addressed it's it's very significant I mean angioplasty things that we take for granted these were innovations small companies small inventors that created these technologies in the hope that they would not only be established for the benefit of humanity but that they could create a thriving business that would employ people that would make money and the investors that put their money into that to believe in it would be get some kind of return that's what it was all based on you know if we're if we're guilty of anything it's it's actually prolonging life that's probably expensive you know we've been create the increased life expectancy you know significantly people Americans spend 56% less time in the hospital you know compared going back to 1980 then they did in 1980 so that's yes technology probably has something to do with that and that's probably expensive because those people are living longer they're consuming more healthcare resources so we have a lot we have an aging population that's probably the biggest driver the aging population you know if you look across world-wide it's not just the US has a baby boom worldwide baby boom this is what's driving health care costs it's the biggest driver healthcare costs we have an aging population people are being treated for many more things than they used to be and there's and that is where it's coming from so what do we have to do we got to make sure we have a strong patent system I think we're making really good progress there we have to think of a better way to reimburse new novel technologies I mean this is something that really needs to be addressed and I think you want it you know when you hear about you look on the news and you hear hey you know balloon-sided-plastic new way to treat chronic side and you say you want that therapy you know you don't want to go get cut up and have surgery you want to have the opportunity to have something less invasive you don't want everybody have open chest surgery when they could have angioplasty so we want these these procedures that can make our lives better faster without so much trauma and pain so we have to figure out a way to pay for those and we need a system that allows novel technologies to get a foothold without starving them and only the survivors that go through that can last that process are left at the end we didn't FDA process that is predictable and that we can navigate with reasonable cost and and still provide reasonable you know assurance of safety and efficacy and we got to think differently about conflicts we have to we have to manage conflicts but we should not exclude conflicts people who may have conflicts need to reveal them but to exclude them from the debate to to basically categorize all of their ideas as tainted would be very unfortunate you know very very unfortunate I mean it really is not the way we built you know the country that way we have everybody's voice and everybody gets to have input and we recognize we just recognize you know from what what what background and influences they come from and that should be openly acknowledged but we can't you know we can't exclude people from the debate and you know we need to reinforce as a society how important innovation is to all of us and how important it is that we strike some kind of balance strike some kind of balance and the safety that we expect even ourselves you know we we have to realize we can't live in a bubble when we get into a car you know we we don't go and believe that it's general motors fault if we get into a car accident in the parking lot you know that's the way we have to look at the unfortunately that's the way it is I mean we can't predict everything that's going to go on the biological system that we're trying to address in Medtech we wish that there was a perfect model that we could get everything out but things happen we learn things it's that learning that allows us to make products better and it's that learning that allows us to iterate and if that iterative loop is delayed significantly because of regulatory delay then we're going to see things that are wrong that we got to fix and they won't get to the market for years I don't think we want that we want a rapid innovative system that's what the 15k system was developed to do was to build upon the innovations of the last innovator by some incremental improvement and just be able to get that out fast so you could continue innovating and advancing medicine at a great pace as opposed to waiting for years for the next incremental innovation to appear on the market if we do all this we will you know really repair our industry continue to bring bright minds into it and really drive our economy so for those of you in the audience who are listening or present who are in a Medtech company if you are if you're a company or whatever you got to become a member of one of these societies it's very important you need your voice heard this is happening to you all this is happening right now as we speak there are meetings in Washington every week got to get on the get on the roster be a part of the process if you're not you can be a part of the process too learn about it get involved talk to congresspeople directly right to them get get involved express your views either side it's okay but it's important that we all take take very very quick action because it's changing right now the impact of what is going to happen within the next couple of months could affect you know your children your your yourself your parents these are very very impactful things that are going on right now and so your voice matters so make sure you're a part of the debate we still have time to act but the wave is coming thank you very much so questions I guess yeah we have some questions a comment had a question yes the comment is in terms of the parties and players that are against innovation you'd be very interesting to compare them on job creation metrics and I'll bet you the fewer jobs they create the more they're against innovation for very understandable dinosaur type protecting old technology reasons but my question is what is interesting to you in comparing incubators across the great divide between the public and private sector because you have a revolving door in Washington and I also heard that a DNA RNA type patent was reversed recently so is there anything interesting do you when you look at these small business innovation research grants that I guess are across several federal agencies and how effective those are compared to private sector incubators so the questions you know is there a difference between a private sector and a public sector and a bit or you know I think they're probably is I think that you know we we try to the model that that we really try to execute on is one that where we can create the greatest opportunity for patients that also represents a sustainable business and that's a important component because in our current setup you know there just isn't the resource who's going to pay to develop all who's going to pay for it I mean it's amazing because you know the challenges that we have in some of the companies is you know they say well you know all of your trials have been sponsored by the company so you know how can we know we can really believe them it's okay you know why don't you guys you know run a trial oh wow we don't have any money for that I mean how are we going to advance medicine here you know where is it going to come from so you know we this is the issue I mean either there needs to be that money allocated for it or it's not available and private industry has to do it so it's either way but I think that that you know you're right now anyway a lot of the public you know kind of activities are are focused on you know basic science and you know very valid and important stuff that that has a place but it doesn't it isn't all commercializable and not all of it is is you know kind of transferable into the to broader application because it doesn't have necessarily the mindset of how do you actually also make this a sustainable business and so it doesn't necessarily get up to you so I have two questions yeah so the first question is that to what extent could these kinds of issues be outsourced to legal warriors and to what degree because this seems to be detracting from your time inventing things creating new applications all events true enjoying the benefits of what you've created of basking in the glory of your creation I like basking so I like to ask more how can how can you be shielded from having to worry about this at the expense of creating I don't know I mean the question's you know how can why why is how come I'm doing this and well you know how could I not have to do it you know I I wish that there were a different way but the truth is that you know the way we do it is we all get involved I mean the answer is everybody who has a who has a who cares about what I just talked about today gets involved I mean this is if this touched you in some way get involved you know if you know somebody you know who can have influence make sure they understand your point of view if you're just a patient listening to this make sure you express your your how how you feel because there's a perception out there that we need to protect everybody you know we need to protect everybody from you know companies you know trying to make money selling technology but you know that's this is the way our society is built and we're in a capitalist society right now still so as long as that's the case you're not going to see you know new things happening unless there's some kind of business part of it there's got to be some profit opportunity for these things to be created it's just the way it works where is the money is going to who's going to put the money into investing these companies right so so we got to get involved so they I think the answer is you know for me as an you know kind of running an incubator I've got several companies in the game so I can see how this wave is affecting all of them at the same time maybe that's part of it you know that's why the foundry the guys of the foundry and myself and other incubators and you know and other people who are involved with multiple companies like myself I mean to us it's like you know you're you're standing you watch this way it's affecting every single one of our businesses in the light this is why the the VCs are also but but I think patience and innovators haven't unique opportunity to have a voice here because unfortunately you know big companies have been cast into a bad place venture capitalists and be cast and they all just the money people and big companies just big big big companies you know they're these big monolithic things and so that leads the rest of us and you know if they're being isolated and excluded from really having a voice here because you know they're they're they're not viewed favorably that's where patience is going to get involved that's where innovators need we create jobs you know innovators create jobs and technology to help people in the medtech space we need to be we need to have our voices and all of you if the only part of this is that you're patient your voice needs to be you need to decide and and if you agree with what I've talked about today you need to get involved one of the counter arguments I've heard about there is like FDA's trying to protect like act as a check in balance yes to the companies that might be trying to further their personal interests so like I just want to hear your thoughts and where is that balance between like the rights of the patients to be like I want this experiment done on me versus yes the government trying to protect great question the question is what's the right balance for the role of the FDA there is an important role for the FDA and and really for many years you know the FDA created challenges for us in the medtech industry but those were for the most part I think reasonable and there's an appropriate amount of scrutiny that technology needs to be put through and and I and I we don't want the FDA to go away I mean it's an important part of of what we do it this should be this should be a regulated industry there should be standards just like there are in other countries we have the CE ISO standard and that works very very well the ISO CE process is exceptionally navigable predictable and successful what happens here in our country unfortunately is that the waves of the medium the waves of of politics kind of wash over that whole system and influence it that doesn't really happen as much overseas it does a little bit but much to a much much letters lesser extent and you know we have and because of that it's what it's what you know like what happens is something shows up in New York Times some somebody's outraged in on congress they bring the FDA in and say you know how could you ever have let this happen you guys are not doing a good enough job I mean the FDA is just trying to do what they're supposed to do they're just trying to they're public servants they're doing what they think the public wants us to wants wants from us so they're getting that voice from congress you know you guys are not tough enough and then you know the next thing that happens is you know some struggling medical device company brings you know the this issue like we can't get this thing approved their FDA is standing in the way you know and you know how we're going to get done and they go to their congressmen and say that that's ridiculous I agree you guys are not letting technology out to patients I mean it's just back and forth and it's something they've been slapped back and forth it's not fair it isn't right but it's part that's part of the problem so what you know we need to agree on what those reasonable assurances are of safety and efficacy and and stick to it you know let's let's make it predictable and allow company say oh here's the check box if I do these three things it's okay it's not going to be subjected to some other level of theoretical review because they're so afraid that if they let it go they're going to you know they're going to get slapped down again and that's in the reason is because we it's just hard to predict everything you know in real life you know the clinical trials by by their nature study one element of the disease with one aspect of the technology and we just can't we can't simulate the real world environment in the clinical trial there's just too many variables we'd never learn anything it would be this massive I mean we'd be treating everybody anyway you're just to try to get all the inputs so to do that we have to be very specific we have to narrow it but in real practice every day doctors do what they think is better for the patient they take a technology and they use it to help somebody sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't work and that's just the reality of where we are so I think if we can all accept what that reality is then we can accept when sometimes things don't go right but we don't necessarily have to blame the FDA for all that and you know I mean if there was something that was wrong and it was hidden or that kind of bad stuff I'm not excusing any of that and that's there's been some of that in the industry it's not good it doesn't help anything so we're not trying to talk about that what we're talking about is the general standard being applied for everybody it just needs to be fair predictable reasonable and as long as it's all those things it's okay there's a good place for regulation in the industry yeah I have a question about I was sort of surprised to see that you put comparative effectiveness research in the category of potential need dangerous because it seems like for a number of these issues around you know entrenched practices or having fair processes for reimbursement complex with interest that comparative effectiveness could move in that for a few years I think it's a great point because I as I fundamentally believe in the general thinking behind comparative effectiveness if applied applied appropriately but but it can be also applied inappropriately and so let me give you an example when angioplasty was first introduced the balloons were the first generation because they really I mean after a couple of monkeys and you know some animal experiments but who didn't really have real cardiac disease they needed to go start work in a patient and they got it pretty successful but it was you know it really only addressed very few lesions could be reached by these things and they realized oh it's got to be a little bit more flexible it's got to be this and then they then they made them more flexible and then they realized oh it's got to be different pressures because sometimes we get a really tight calcified lesion and other times we don't we you know there was just no way to simulate any of this so then they did that and so if you looked at it over time eventually the therapy got developed you know through lots of these experiences then these these these technologies didn't necessarily hurt anybody but they just didn't work as desired maybe they ultimately got cardiac surgery now a couple of people probably also got hurt but it was it was a new technology but over time that that therapy has become what it is today which is a tremendously successful fantastic alternative to coronary bypass surgery okay now we can compare it but think about if we compare it back when it was first introduced it would never have existed we would not have balloon angioplasty or stenting available to us today if we subjected that technology at that time to compare it to the existing cardiac surgery now I go back further let's look at cardiac surgery and anyone who knows the history of cardiac surgery and what it took to develop the right perfusion pumps without clots without sending you know with you know being able to sustain people without damaging their brains to be able to sustain hearts in a still in a still mode without damaging their hearts it was time these were we accepted at that point in time the risks because of the severe consequences of not doing something right so that's how technology I mean it's it's not pretty but it's how medical technology has gotten to where it is it's part of the innovative process in the space so we yeah I think applied in the appropriate way at the appropriate time it will allow us to proceed and innovate apply it inappropriately nothing new will ever be established as as valid enough so that's that's the answer when we have a preparation never so in this time particularly basis please help me thank dodge for this time thank you thank you thank you very much you have been listening to the draper Fisher-Jurvis and
