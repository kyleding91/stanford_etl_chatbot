 Who you are defines how you build. This is the OddPattern thought leader series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. On this episode we're joined by Arlen Hamilton, founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital. A venture capital firm dedicated to minimizing funding disparities in technology by investing in high potential founders who are people of color, women and LGBT. Backstage is invested in dozens of startups led by underestimated founders and has been featured in Forbes, the Wall Street Journal, Courts and many others. There is, I would say, oftentimes two narratives that get told about founders. There is a narrative about founders as vision holders where you have a founder who can see into the future more clearly than anybody else and uses that vision to trumpet the resources they need. Think about Elon Musk saying, I want to go to Mars and we're all going to get there. There is another narrative that says that entrepreneurship is not about knowing the end but it's all about managing the process and that the end can be far bigger than you ever even expected and the great founders are ones that can manage the risks along the way and there are process driven methodologies, the design school at Stanford's Ply the most famous year with the D school methodology. And so I want to start out with this question, did you know when you were a child that you wanted to be a venture capitalist? Did you have the vision of being a venture capitalist when you were younger? No, when I was younger I shaved one of my eyebrows off when I, that tells you something. Yes. That's the story. And I had to pencil, my mom had to pencil it in for weeks with her eyeliner. So no, I wasn't sitting around. And did you know what venture capital was? No, I didn't know until my 30s what venture capital really was. I heard the term in the ether but I did not know what it was, I also didn't care it was. And it was my early 30s that I started to understand what venture capital was and so when I was a child, since I was very little though I was definitely a founder. And so I feel like this is definitely full circle. Because you had that spirit inside of you. And so can you, I don't want to summarize your whole life up, but can you then mark the salient moments in your life and paint a picture for what it was like as a child, what you were like as a child and then how you went from that to being the venture capital, the starter and founder of venture capital fund today. I love to, can I get a little understanding though of who has heard of backstage capital just so I can understand? Okay, great. I was an adorable child as you can probably imagine. I was very precocious as they say. I was very once my mother told me it was okay to speak up. I spoke up as soon as I only had to learn that lesson once. So I asked a lot of questions when I was a child. I was also very tall and what we like to call big-bonded as a child. So I was kind of intimidating to some, including teachers for whatever reason, even though I was goofy and very good student. And I asked every question I could. I remember back on the fifth grade, I think it was, the fourth grade. They asked that question about if a tree falls in the woods. Does it make a sound if anyone hears it? And I remember still to this day I thought my answer was it makes the vibration that causes sound. And like the fourth grade, I was thinking about that sort of thing. And I remember being sort of dismissed when I said that by the teacher because it was just like, it wasn't something that she was expecting to hear from. But I was at the same time I was like obsessed with, like the lemonade stand type of thing. So I had a little candy shop going in the third grade. I also wore six watches in the third grade because I was a little odd. But it was because I was like totally odd and it's going to be a great first scene of the lifetime movie one day. But it was because I found out from it in the psychopedia, which I could read very early, I found out that there were people in other parts of the world who had, there was different time for them. And for some people it was dark while it was light where it was with where I was. And that blew my mind. And so from a very early age, I felt a deep connection to people from all over the world, even though I didn't quite understand the scope of what that really meant. So everything from that moment on I can trace back to wanting connection and seeking it and also building it and catalyzing it. And you said that you always knew that you were a founder. And what I want to know is, the class that I teach is called the spirit of entrepreneurship. And part of that is trying to understand this ineffable drive that certain people have to break out from the pack whereas others don't. And there is one school of thought that says that you're just born that way. And maybe that was the case that you always knew that you were a founder. And there's another school of thought that says actually almost just like the narrative of superheroes who always have these mythologies where they develop these strengths and stressful situations that real skills and real superhero strengths actually get galvanized in times of stress, not pleasure. If you agree with that, what I'm wondering is, what would you say are your superhero strengths and did those get galvanized in times of stress or do you feel like they were just intrinsic to you? I think it's all a mixture of all of that because I think that I definitely enjoyed it before it was something that I thought I needed to do. But I also remember early on understanding what money was and what lack of money was and what it meant and that it made my mom cry not having it. And then if I could find a way to get it, that would change things or I thought it would. And so it was a little bit of both. I do think it was because it started kind of in the third grade, I think it was really intrinsic. I also think superpower wise, I think I call myself like the Simon Cowell, which is like probably a not a good reference for this crowd because you could all be my children. I think at this point I'm 39, yes you could. Wow, that's crazy. But I can see potential very early and I think I have good taste and people and things and I can see around corners a little bit. And you've always been a founder, would you say? Like even when you were a kid you were doing entrepreneurial. Oh yeah, I was. I had my candy shop and then I had my paint by number. I painted on the sidewalks on the curb of people's houses so that the pizza delivery person could find them easier at nights. And I did all this from very early. And what's the difference though? There's a difference between doing a candy shop and being an entrepreneur in that way and then building a venture capital fund from scratch. Not really, I mean. Is there a difference between a side hustle and an ego as both? Well, and maybe there's not. But do you think there's a difference between a side hustle and a viable business that you can commit your life to? Or do you view it as all the same form of entrepreneurship? I mean, one can become the other. Okay. I think it's very legitimate to start as a side hustle and turn it into something. I interview people on my first million podcast all the time who started something that was away from what their day job was. They started on the weekend or they started it as something that they started in their kitchen or something. And it went on to make millions of dollars and be their life's work so far. So I think both, yeah. I just have to say that. You know, we have many people in the entrepreneur thought leader seminar who are founders of startups and they talk about that journey to be a founder of a startup. I personally come up from a venture capital background and I know how much harder it is to actually start a fund. Can you educate people on what the difference is between being a founder of a fund versus being a founder of a startup? And why that is, why I would consider that what it, why it's more challenging in some ways? It's like riding a unicycle on fire underwater on the sun. So I've done both and I've definitely, you know, I haven't built, like I've built a lot of little companies and a lot of little projects and things and then I built this massive kind of movement starter thingy with this fund and firm. But I have seen 6,000 plus companies in the last five or so years invested in 130 of them. And I, and a lot of cases we are with them and the trenches side by side. And even as, you know, I don't want it to be like the oppression Olympics. It's like, oh, you're more difficult. But I can say even comparing it to anything I've done in the past or anything that I would do. Like if I wanted to have a break, I would start a company that I was passionate about. Because this is raising a fund is really difficult. I think the way that I did it and chose to do it and put myself out there is an on a whole new level. So I would even, I would even say raising a fund is harder than raising, like raising for a company or starting a company. But that, you know, can debate me about that if you're a founder. And I would say raising it the way that we have is more difficult than your, than your average fund. Yeah, let me just double emphasize that because I would say, you know, if people probably don't realize this. But when you raise money for a startup, you have to get maybe one investor, maybe a, one institutional investor, maybe a handful of angel investors. But one investor can make all the difference and then you're off. When you raise money for a fund, you typically need to get at least 10 investors because nobody wants to own more than a certain percentage of that fund. So it's like hurting a ton of cats. And many people would say that you can't do that unless you, you know, you work at a venture fund for a while. And so what I think is just the, the holy thing that you've done is, is, is, is raise a fund from a lateral, a lateral move. And, and I want people to really understand this. So, you know, the definition of entrepreneurship that we often use is from this Harvard professor Howard Stevenson who talks about entrepreneurship as the pursuit of opportunity without regard for resources controlled. And that usually we can talk about that in this class, but it, it comes more in stark relief. When you really come from a place where you have no advantages in that domain. And I want people just to understand the grit that it takes to do what you did. Can you walk us through how many emails you had to send and how many meetings you had to have and other hustles to get to your first check in the fund? And how big that first check was. Yeah. So, approximately three years of nose. So, nothing. At least half of that if not more without a permanent residence. And a lot of cases just really not knowing where I was going to sleep that night. And a lot of cases not having, having like one meal understood. Like actually, it's, I'll break for a second to tell you that I went to a course here at Stanford in this same hallway, like around the corner for two weeks. That kind of was where I met my first LP Susan. And it was a lot of million Susan Kimberlin. Susan Kimberlin, I say her name every time. It was a lot of millionaires in this course because it was like a how do you spend your money better sort of thing. And I was the only one that I know of who was like broke broke. And so, I would, they didn't know I knew this in the class, but I would like figure out how to put together like a dollar 19 or dollar nine. One of the taxes so I could go to Taco Bell down the street when I got back to where I was staying and have like my dinner. And that was 2015. So, that was like just a few months before I got my first check from Susan. So, it had been months and years of that. And I probably, I don't know the exact number, but when I was featured on Gimlett's startup podcast series last year. And they recorded me for months before it came out. And they had me just go back and do all this crazy vetting of, you know, diligence on me for me to say, did you really do that thing that you said you did in four months ago on tape? So, I'd have to go find the proof, the evidence and an email, which thankfully I still had because I have these emails. So, I was able to look and like just in searching for a word or a phrase, I was like, oh my God, like I had talked about how much I, how much outreach I did, but my goodness, seeing them just back to, I mean, I'm talking hundreds of emails, but maybe more than that, maybe in the thousands over those three years. And how many knows, do you think before your first yes? Hundreds. And how big was that first yes after three years and hundreds of knows and? Approximately $50,000. $50,000. In a world where, which was amazing and I will always be grateful to Susan for that because no one was doing anything. But this is in a world where I had to compete with people who had millions out the gate. And can you walk me through what that's like to, so you, I can't fathom this. And I want to just make this really clear for people. So you would, you're going to these meetings, you're pitching these people, you're going to the Stanford class to Hobnob with the millionaires. And you don't know. Hobnobbing, that's why I could work for. And then, and where are you, where are you waking up? Where are you going to sleep? How are you dealing with the bifurcation of that world? Are you pretending you're one thing and then or? Absolutely not. Okay, so can you walk us through just what it's like? Okay, so it was different at different times. So I started out in parallel in Texas near part of Houston. And parallel, when I first started learning about VC and the disparities in capital between white men and everyone else getting capital from venture capital. I was in parallel and I was in an apartment with my mom. I had my bedroom, I had a blow up bed and I had a white board that I was teaching myself about cap tables on and reading Brad Feldbooks. And we got kicked out of that because we couldn't pay the rent. So then we moved into a comfort in and we shared a room and every night or every morning we'd figure out how to pay for the next for the next night. And sometimes we go down and talk to the owner and he would see us coming and he'd be like, and we'd be like, hey man, hey, looking good, man, how you doing? Yeah, can we get like a week just you know? And we just ended up, I mean, for like two years it was the address to my driver's license because we lived there and we just made our way. And with my mom, I go out and get a gig and I would get, and she's under 60s at that time. I would go out and get a gig. I was trying to get a car so I could work for Uber because it was the early years of that. Couldn't get a car. All of that. And then couldn't afford that anymore. Move to Fluegerville in Austin, north of Austin because I wanted to be closer to startups. If I couldn't be in Silicon Valley, I wanted to at least be closer in Texas to startup world at that time. And it wasn't at that time. So prevalent in Houston and got a kind of a lifeline in the form of a small personal loan from Sam Altman, which is a whole other story. And that helped us have an Airbnb for a few months. And like because he understood, but while I was at the Airbnb is when I got the word that I was going to be able to come here for this 500 startups. And I was a program that you all have. And I didn't have any money and it cost a lot of money, even though I was getting a scholarship to cost a lot of money. So made my way here. And I had about 10 days worth of Airbnb. And in fact, there's a guy here who had his own company that was venture funded. And I was staying at his place in East Palo Alto. And I couldn't pay him at the end of it. Like he let me, like there's these people that have kind of gone back to and thanked because he let me stay for a few days. But I was in these classes. So to answer your question about what was I portraying myself as? I was never ashamed of any of this. I was actually proud that I was surviving. But I wasn't going to put my whole, you know, sad, sad story to anybody. That wasn't important. I tried that a couple of times and I'm like, wait a minute. That's not really what this is about. Because what this is about is getting more funding to underrepresented founders. It's about me seeing a great, great deal flow. It's about a fund that needs to exist. And all of this is going to be temporary. And we'll get to business, the business out of it. So I did end up sleeping at the airport. And I don't recommend it. And I'm not joking. I say that people start laughing. But what I'm saying is there have been people who have started staying at the airport to try to impress me. And I find it really insulting and painful when they do that. Because I didn't do that for fun or giggles. And they're trying to do it. So I'm just really saying don't cross that line and don't do that. Don't put yourself in that position. Because I was there because it was the safest place I could be without any place to live. Yeah. Well, let me shift now then to talk about identity and the thesis for backstage backstage. Backstage. Backstage. Backstage. Yes. So you talk about how less than 10% of venture capital dollars go to people of color, LGBT or women. And that is the focus of the fun. What does the world not still appreciate or understand about under estimated minorities that you would like to shine a light on? I mean a lot. So much. We don't have time for it here. I mean, I always have to kind of laugh because look at this room. Look at the room. You can't tell me that the only people in this room are the white. Only people in this room who can start great companies that are profitable are the few white guys that are here. Even the white guys in here can't say that. Doesn't make any sense. So there's this still to this day. There's this whole thing of as soon as you say D&I diversity inclusion underrepresented even under estimated, which we've coined. People start they immediately go to that is either an HR problem or that is a charity problem or that is a down and out. Poor you problem instead of that's your problem now because that's your biggest competition coming for you and coming for you without any of this baggage of what they think they're expected to. And so you're seeing it now you're seeing that's a there's a reason delaying the esports CEO just raised about a hundred million dollars for his company out of nowhere. You didn't see him coming. We did we saw we saw him years ago. There's a reason that these things are happening because we don't sit around. If you're a woman you know this already you know that you're a master multitasker and sometimes you'll be sitting and I'm talking to the ladies now. You'll be sitting with the guy and he'll say something that he did and how difficult it was and you'll just be like. I did that before noon for even got here you know what I mean and it's like that so everybody in this room even straight white men. Have something that they're underestimated about because everybody everybody no matter how good of a person they are is prejudges. So when you walk into a room or you're in a room and someone's judging you like I give it quick example because I think it's important to think about privilege in all cases. So I can have this whole conversation say all this and I can say and why guys do this and this and that and then we can all get up to leave and I can notice that one of the white men that I was talking about. Is in a wheelchair and I made the assumption that he had it easier than I did because he's a white Europe. So there's it's everywhere and I just think people are still sleeping and that's better for me to make me even more wealthy faster but I need to wake up. And then so so then do you espouse I think there's sort of two schools of thought when it comes to identity there was a school of thought that talks about how difference is an advantage and you should trump it your difference and it's also because you're looking at the world differently and so trump it the differences and then there's another school of thought that says no what we really need to espouse is to transcend differences or identities and realize that it's really superficial. How do you reconcile those two or I mean I don't necessarily agree when I know sometimes it's coming from a good place when someone says I don't look at color I don't see color but that's that's like your privilege talking you you get not to look at color but people who are of color or black or however you want to call it Latinx or whatever we have to think about color every day of our lives if you're walking around in this country. And I mean today I was at an event and I went to go get a little snack at the hotel snack place and I was like looking at it with my little VC card you know going to pay for these expensive almonds because it can 699 and a nice little friendly Caucasian lady just rain up to me working I pay for these and I'm like I know you should ask someone who works here maybe we should do that and she's just you know right and it happens all the time and I'm always miss you. I'm just taking for the help in this and that. So we have to see I think you have to I think it's disingenuous to say that we're not different I think it's it's just not realistic and it's not mature I think we say yes we are different in this way my difference everybody the cool thing is that there's there are every single human being is different than everyone else no matter what even if you're twin. So you use the strengths of your differences and and talk about it openly that's my opinion. Now you shifted so you have this headline fund that you're pursuing now called the it's about damn time fund yes and so the name of my book that you can pre order right now you can open up go ahead and open up your phones it's PRH dot com slash it's about damn time go ahead and click that pre order but there's the founder there's the founder if you have the means go for it. But you did the the the headline or fund it's about damn time fund is specifically focused on black women so you decided to get you decided to narrow the focus down more can you explain why focus just on black women and how is that decision made sure can. Yes so we invest in women people of color LGBTQ which is a lot a lot of people is more than half half the population even just at women right and we invested in a hundred of those and that in that thesis then I look at the the the stats and it said that women well there's two some people say we get black women get point two percent of all venture funding which if you do the math last year 130 billion dollars was deployed so we shared. As black women in startups shared the equivalent of birds last round of funding some people say it's even less than that. And I looked at that and I said and I also understood that for every million dollars that I white man raises a black woman raises 28,000 when she is able to raise right not if you're doing apples apples because it would be in your minus go. So I said there the only reason you could have a problem with me starting a fund that just puts her on level ground is if you're afraid that she will beat you when she gets there and so to me it was just a it's one more part of the thesis it's one more vertical just like we just like if I had been out for three years and I realized you know what AI is where I'm going to focus this next fund that's the same way I look at it. And don't you think there's a power in focus and simplicity even though I think some people would argue that those same claims to different degrees can be made about the other communities that you can and there's nothing to say that we won't do other funds but we're starting there. And how do you respond to people to say that say that you know you are responding to an injustice with an injustice that there's you're you're you're your fund itself is is by it. It would depend on how they're saying it if they're saying it on Twitter and their basement with their thumbs they can we can go fly somewhere because that honestly it doesn't mean anything to me. If they're honestly if they honestly see a problem with this and they're willing to talk to me about it like a mature person I'd love to have the conversation when you have I don't know if you heard but I said 0.2% is the high version of the number that black women get in venture funding and we make up nearly 10% of the population at seven or eight percent of population doesn't make any sense already that should be what people are worried about and upset about they should not be upset about someone coming in and saying you know what I'm just going to slightly try to change that to point one percent you know so I want to end on on on focusing on a little bit around principle driven entrepreneurship and then we'll open it up for a for for questions but I want to sort of double click on two specific scenarios to really dive deep into understanding how to be a principle driven founder and this is one of the core new focuses for STVP is thinking about principle driven entrepreneurship. There was a situation where you are offered a 250 K check as an investment to backstage capital from Peter teal no it was someone associated with him he doesn't probably know that exists okay but that 250 K check is 25 K Susan Kimberland checks that's that's 10 25 K checks that you could give to black women that would actually make them make their businesses potentially survive when they otherwise would fail correct you said no to that 250 K check correct Can you walk through your principle driven process on how you made that decision so it was it feels like a lifetime ago yeah but it was in October of 2016 and what happened was for a couple of months someone had been talking to me about this like closing out this fund the first fund so our first one was ended up being 1.2 million and I mean it was so hard earned you know It was brick by brick by brick and we needed that last bit of it to close it out because we had companies in queue that we had chosen as 2% of what we had seen so we really needed it just to keep going to and so this come this person who was very wealthy came in there people got in touch with me and said you know we're interested in doing this they want to be anonymous publicly so you wouldn't say who it was this this and that so I knew who it was and The stuff started happening with Trump get it you know Getting he's gonna be the nominee and he was the nominee and he was gonna do all this and then these tapes come out of him saying things about grabbing women and sexual assault him admitting to that and the same kind of time period Peter was a partner at or like a visiting partner at why commentator now I just told you earlier that Sam Altman is a friend of mine and helped me before That did not stop the fact that I felt it was wrong for for Peter to still be there and enjoy that That privilege of being there so I call that out on Twitter I said I'm no longer gonna be sending companies that way they I'm not stopping them from going there I'm not saying you're bad if you go there. I personally will not continue to send the deal flow that I have been helping YC with until he's gone No, it's just my personal decision and when I said that out loud I became this whole thing it was picked up on all of these At all this press and Sam got in touch with me and Michael got in touch with me as this whole thing and at the same time I was like wait a minute I know that this other person is so like entrenched in that Peter to a world Let's just see what they're saying online about it like it doesn't mean that they they're a bad person because Sam's not a bad person Right, they're good friends. Let's just see what they're saying and I go over to their social media And they are just defending till I shouldn't say that till the I'm sorry I forgot to make the connection he During that same time Announced or it was announced that he put another million dollars behind Trump Now if tea let me tell you this if till had run for president himself I like a conservative libertarian or conservative ticket I wouldn't have agreed with him for a moment, but I would have respected the hell out of him What I did not respect was him saying you know what he's saying this about people of color He's saying this about likes very specifically about Mexican people. He's saying this about immigrants He's saying this about women. He's done these things to women some of it. He's admitted to Some of it he's been accused of that's horrible He's also doing all these things that are gonna affect this It's not like we're talking about freedom of speech to you know say what you want to say on Fox We're talking about someone who could become the president and you're speaking with your dollars that you want this in office And I said how would how could I with in good faith? Say this thing on Twitter about not sending people and about and really Almost losing a friendship with Sam and then go behind Anonymously and take the money. I just felt like I couldn't live with myself No one would have ever known, but I would have known and it just didn't make any sense to me So I said so I said to the to the to the people that were vetting it I said, you know, this is a really hard decision and I thank them for for doing this And that the thing was it was actually half a million because they were going to have someone else in there portfolio come in as well. I said it was can't take the money Thank you for yeah, first for sharing. I want to dive into one other situation just to understand about resilience and so There was a lot of attention a little while ago when you announced the it's about damn time fund Yeah, you announced it as a 36 million dollar fund. Yes, and then it didn't close. Yes And so what I want to first ask is what when you when you announced and I want to and what I want to really understand Is how you have gone through that process from a resilience perspective? But first just so that people understand the facts when you made the announcement Yes, it legally signed did they they signed the documents for the for for the commitments or did you make the announcement with a verbal commitment? What I what I announced was and for months we had been working on it. Yeah, we first the first thing we did because we were going to be in a six episode Podcast the gimli podcast where I was going to 500,000 or so people were going to be listening every week The first thing our lawyer said was this fun that you're doing quietly that before it was announced has to be a general solicitation fund Because you're priming the pump you're going to be accused of that So we were like really and we're so okay So we signed it up as a general solicitation, which means you can talk about it press usually you can't talk about fundraising while it's happening That's the first thing we did so we're a general solicitation so I can talk about it here I can talk about it anywhere The second thing that happened was we I was speaking at an event May 2018 and on that panel I announced that we were raising a 36 million dollar fund That was going to be deployed a million dollars at a time we had We had an anchor and we had some commitments. It was not fully raised like 80% of funds and you know this as a fund manager most funds Don't get raised overnight because we had the general solicitation. I was able to talk about it sooner than most people would I did it because I wanted people to hear about it I wanted people to want to invest in it So I made the announcement we were doing that in the room I think people understood what I was saying because they said we're raising it the first I when I got off stage my phone blew up It was a different world when I got off stage The first people to write the story about it were recode Peter Kafka He wrote A backstage has 36 million dollars to I immediately wrote to him and I said it's we're raising it He immediately retracted and said backstage is seeking 36 million dollars Some people took that headline and said it correctly and some people did it I went on Twitter and I said we're raising it. I had a little picture of Cardi B. I said we're raising it the same day all of that anytime anybody asked me I said we're raising it because I wanted people to invest in it We already had you know 20% of it committed Throughout the throughout the year A lot of things happen really good things happen But one of the bad things that happened was the anchor that we had But where it's so it's a little bit sensitive because that anchor was a black person themselves And I really wanted them to be the anchor they Backed out can you walk us through that's so how did you feel when you how did you find that out and how did they back out? Yeah, and how did you feel at that moment and then how did you I um, I You know what? It was it was going to be their first investment out of a very large fund and they had a lot of experience in the past And they were finding out that they were not going to be able to close their first close So for me, I was like and this has happened many times where I thought As bad as this sucks This is the least of their worries right now because they have to now and I thought I really thought at least It's not me. I don't have to worry about this amount this crazy amount And I thought you know, I was just spent the last three four years raising brick by brick. I'll do the same thing here So our plan was we had two companies that were lined up in our diligence where we're going to invest in those two companies This is a fund that's going to be deployed over three four five years a little bit at a time As long as we do it as long as we do it in some way we can do it So I wasn't I wasn't concerned. That's why I didn't panic or say anything. I was Disappointed and it felt like I had taken two steps forward to take ten steps back But this happens all the time to us all the time we have billionaires who pull out the last minute all the time Who go on Twitter and get their Forbes article and then and then take from us. So I I have I've been used as an example in a new and the adaptability quotient So there's EQ IQ and aQ now. I am used as like baseline example of aQ because my adaptability um It's so the level so high because we've had so I've had so many disappointments. So it was it was devastating But it wasn't the first time wasn't the first time and you knew that you you had the long term vision to just I look at things in decades I don't look at them in quarters. Yeah, right? So I think that's the key so it was um Neck one foot in the front of the other. That's a great um thought to And I should say that a few weeks ago. I led a three million dollar rate around from mommy I brought in Mark Cuban for another million and I brought in some really serenary to join the round as well So we're doing okay? Awesome Well With that I want to open it up to the crowd so um You can calm down you can play teacher Arlen. So you get to call whoever you want Okay, I kind of want to know about how you all plan to work with your portfolio companies and then it's about What type of How do we plan to work with the portfolio companies in our new It's about damn time fund like as compared to what we do now Because what we do what we do now is we have a hundred and total of about 130 companies across these different funds um We're very hands-on on a lot of them. I would say 20 to 30 percent we talked to on a monthly basis It's probably 10 percent that we might as well be co-founders And then the rest we just have like this scalable way of talking to them so they can come to us if they need one one thing here There we don't take any credit of course for building their companies. They're building them But it's very much a tribe and a community we try to get them together either virtually or in person As often as possible because that's when the real magic happens And then I think what we're best at is follow on finding follow on funding for companies and also Just being being there for them. So a lot of times where they're smallest check in their first call and so with the new fund The thing that will be different is that we will invest like right now It's about an average of two percent that we invest in will probably invest in the point to right point two percent like Well, invest in a lot fewer companies because it's going to be A larger check for us and then over in the next no two years from then then we'll raise a bigger fund and we'll do this and that but I think I think you know if we're able to invest in Three to four of these companies per year that are this million dollars at a time They're more than likely going to get An extra bit of my time which is which is right now pretty difficult to do Yes, I'm just going like it For the type of companies you're looking for are you looking for companies that's gonna make everybody billionaires or do you also just me Are you also considered social in So the double bottom line or it'll make money, but it might also do my social good is that part of your Yeah, do we look at companies that are only about I'm doing it right now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry Um Do we look for companies that are only about the bottom line and they have to be like outside unicorns or do we Look at social impact and it's a combination So I personally will look at any of it um, you know, the first few funds that we have have have an a limited partner agreement Which is our agreement with our investors. It's very specific and it's more traditional It's like we're looking for companies that can scale at a certain place and we're trying to Just as fund managers bring them back Three plus X, you know, I've heard 10x before which means that because so many companies will will die out The winners have to be big big winners financially I think they can be both though. There are a lot of companies now some of the companies that are doing the best in our portfolio Our social impact companies and so I'm just kind of bullish there anyway So I guess the best way to answer is to say that if I were to start a fund from scratch from my own capital I would be looking I would be looking for companies that yes could become unicorns It's all good and also companies that would catalyze Others in a different way and and kind of measure it in different ways for sure Yes To come think of funding or to drop key technologies and see what are the top three technologies so just like the Industries like yeah, so the I mean they're the vertical so we're we're agnostic fund and agnostic fund So we see everything But what what is really kind of Coming to the for right now is like health tech specifically Femtech But like a lot of deep tech you know in the health space Femtech and then consumer Direct to consumer Yes So what do you see next? The next two or three years in the valley I don't think about anything When it comes to trends or what other people are gonna do I have no idea what they're gonna do I know what I like and what I like is things that have to do with renewable energy and with health And then anything that's like Really like something that's really been interesting recently is like how do we How do we handle what's coming with drones and managing them and how do we handle what's coming with autonomous vehicles and managing them like the infrastructure for those types of things not just the things themselves It's just interesting to me personally and the good thing is that we have many people on the team who can write checks And they have their each of their individual preferences I'll go someone further back Yes You talk about the Early days when you're getting rejected a lot how you persevered and got through that yeah, I did a lot of crying Can you repeat the question? Yes, I can thank you. Can I talk about the early days How I persevered through the hard parts hard times I cried a lot Uh fetal position I cried a lot and I also Did a lot of it was it was very lonely Um, not to make you sad for me, but it just was it was there were no a lot of people who understood from any world That was in right they didn't quite understand what I was doing so I would um I had the had that whiteboard so at the the old place in the new place I had the words keep going written in red with an exclamation point I would like look up at it and I would say you know you you're a clever a few days ago You told me that a month ago. I'm gonna do it. So I would just tell myself to keep going. I would um I would um, you know, let myself feel the pain of it and not be ashamed by it I would let myself go through that because it's like the wave of it is probably important but then I would think about What if what if this works? What if that person that you know is just an amazing founder who is just uh inexplicably being overlooked Gets a chance at this and does well and you had some small part in that You have to keep going and I would just kind of talk myself out of of despair That was a lot of it and then music music helped me a lot It's weird. I never say this but I should say this so when I would Be feeling down and I need to kind of get myself psyched to go to have like this power meeting I would listen to walk the moons um shut up and dance. I don't know why but it just got me hyped Of course, I listened to like cardi b back and make a little bit and I listened to to uh little cam and riana and beyond say I did all that but that one song was like my good luck song so there was a question right here. Yes in the back Yes, so you said you folks a lot that they expand on black women. Uh-huh Black woman majority in the US or are you also looking at other countries? So is the black women led companies in the US only are other countries. It's uh global The fund. Yeah. Sorry the fund are we looking only in the US are globally one of our accelerators is in London And so we've already started there so you have a lot of uh british and and african dysphoria spora companies lead companies and then um uh Uh, I thought you were gonna ask what I get asked a lot which by black men which is like Have you forgotten about us and the majority the most the biggest group in our current portfolios black men Just as a an aside for anyone who's questioning that Yes How We get in front of me as a founder since I get inundated with investments my true advice and a lot of times I say this to people in person and they kind of like you see them sort of sink back and they're just like oh You're blowing me off. This is my true advice Especially not necessarily today because I didn't come here with anybody But usually I'm here I'm in person with you with someone on my team and if I'm seeing a thousand pitches a year There may be seeing a hundred I would just don't even just bypass me just go to them At because a lot of people on our team can write checks now you can do that virtually too I don't think the answer is to find me There are christy pits is my investment partner you can return at her first name at backstage capital Brittany Davis is our head of Dillflow. You can reach right Brittany at backstage capital We have anesthesia. We have cha-cha. We have many venture partners like lowlyda Adele all over the country go to our website Look up our team and look at something like find someone on there that you think oh I they went to this school. Maybe I can talk to them about that are they like they have this hobby? I can talk to them about that or maybe I can just ask them what it's like to be on the road with Arlen because I can see there on there I would just be hack if it were me that's what I would be doing I wouldn't be going to the person who's like just I get pitched so often that honestly when I like especially right now I woke up at 345 this morning Somebody tried to pitch me earlier today. I Honestly just I couldn't I can't tell you what they said I couldn't tell you because I was just like oh, but I say like Email me, you know, I'm at Arlen at for at backstage capital.com a lot of our founders It took them like a year or six months to get an investment from us And it's not come you I'll tell you what not to do Don't send a message and then a month later send like I'm only going to ask you one more time We get that passive aggressive stuff, and I'm like oh wait. Let me get my checkbook So sorry no like be real like think about it like let's be cool is I'm not gonna reach everybody But um and also I would say listen to the podcast your first million because I talk a lot about these hacks In that and you learn a lot about me the last thing I'll say Is if you're on Twitter Don't just look at what people tweet go to their page and see what they like And it doesn't always mean they agree with the things are liking But it tells you kind of what they are doing with their free time or with their time And it's actually you can learn a lot. I learned a lot about our investors that way and and found investors that way So with that I have to draw this part of ETL to a close please join me in welcoming Thank you Arlen Hamilton Thank you The entrepreneurial thought leader series is a Stanford e-corner original production The stories and lessons on Stanford e-corner are designed to help you find the courage and clarity to see and seize opportunities Stanford e-corner is led by the Stanford Technology Ventures program and Stanford's Department of Management Science and Engineering To learn more please visit us at e-corner That's Stanford.edu
