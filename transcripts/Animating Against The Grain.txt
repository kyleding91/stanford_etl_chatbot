 Who you are defines how you build. This is the entrepreneurial thought leader's series. Brought to you by Stanford E Corner. On today's episode, we have Maureen Fan, co-founder and CEO of Bowbab Studios, an Emmy Award-winning virtual reality animation studio. Maureen was named one of the most creative people of the year by AdH. She graduated from Stanford with degrees in computer science, art and psychology. Here's Maureen. Thank you. And it's so awesome to be back, but I'm deeply jealous because we didn't have this engineering quad when I was here. Every single year I come back and get more and more jealous about how awesome you guys have had it. But Stanford was the best place to have an undergraduate degree. As you'll see in my presentation, so to answer what the Bowbab tree is, it's this tree that is native to Madagascar and my co-founder Eric Darnell directed all-formatagascar films. So we thought it made sense. Also it has an amazing story because I'm going to talk about storytelling today about how the gods were angry at this tree. So through the tree down and it fell upside down and its roots were the branches instead and its head became the roots and that's why it's such a funny looking tree. But the mission of our company is to inspire you to dream by bringing out your sense of wonder and we felt this tree really showed that. So I'm going to talk today about defining your own path. I'm going to tell you about my path to becoming an entrepreneur. I never expected to become an entrepreneur of deeply introverted, deeply insecure, so much. I didn't think I would have what it took to become an entrepreneur. But through my path from Stanford to eBay, through Zingha, from Hollywood, Pixar, et cetera, I found my voice and that was always by not allowing other people to tell me who I was and who I could be. It's like, am I a woman or am I a man? Am I an introvert or extrovert? Am I a fuzzy or a techie? Am I a suit or a creative? And it's rejecting all that and defining your own path and saying that you can be whatever you want and don't follow the buckets that people want to put you in. So my path, I start off at Stanford. I knew I wanted to do entertainment, so I looked up all the studio's job openings before coming to Stanford and saw what did they want me to major in. It says communications and econ usually. I took those classes, but I loved computer science the most because it was the most difficult. I found that really intellectually stimulating. So I started doing that and then doing symbolic systems because then I started getting excited about logic. And then I took a class at Stanford University Digital Art Center and realized I could combine art with the psychology, with the engineering. And the amazing thing about Stanford is unlike the other schools out there, which are mostly on the semester system, the quarter system allows you to take as many classes as you want. So I took all sorts of classes like Coastal Environmental Zone where I was supposed to travel different beaches on the California coast and study them, which is the best class ever. I highly recommend that you guys take that class. But I fell in love with animation in particular. And I sought to design my own major and Stanford is one of these schools that allows you to do it. I think Brown is the only other school I believe that lets you do it. Stanford doesn't believe that you know what you want to do until you try it out a bunch of classes, which is totally true. So I designed my major here and then I went to eBay. So why did I go to eBay when I wanted to do animation called Tiger Parents. So I really wanted to do animation so badly. But my parents, I'm Asian, my Chinese parents told me that I would be poor and destitute if I fall in my dreams and that I need to do something practical. So instead of falling my dreams to Lucasfilm, I took a job at eBay, which was also super awesome. So no, just on eBay. Because it also used our psychology and computer science, so that was great. But the entire time I was there, I would take classes at Deanza College, Community College, because all the Lucasfilm animators would teach there. So at night time, I take the classes, thinking about the day that my stock options would be worth enough so I could finally escape and do my true passion. But by taking these classes at night, I really learned about the skill of animation and continue to define my own path there instead of just doing one thing. I also found that by drawing every single day and doing art, it made me better at my job at eBay on the business side, which I thought was really strange because I thought it was always about focusing and just doing one thing. But by being cross-disciplinary, that's when you start finding connections between the different disciplines. The best advice I ever got was from a professor here. Her name was Lori Loeb. She was a visiting professor and she taught animation. She's our Dartmouth now leading up animation. And back when I was at Stanford, when I was all angsty about wanting to do animation, and my parents not letting me, she said, don't worry about knowing what you want to do. The most important thing is to do whatever job it is that you have and do it really well. Because you'll learn something that will help you in your path later and the people around you who see you work so hard with your work ethic will come out of the woodworks later on and help you. And I'll show you through the path how that actually did happen. So finally, after doing eBay five years, it's time. I've saved up enough money. It's time to pursue my passion. And I was going to apply to Art Center to get an MFA. But guess what? The deadlines had passed and I was really sad. And my mom said, why don't you apply to Round 3 of Business School? And I thought, because I hate business, but like a beautiful, Confucian daughter. I applied to Harvard. And I got in, but I was going to say no. Because I knew I just really wanted to do this animation thing. It's very stubborn. But my boss at eBay said, don't be an idiot, Ryan. You think Hollywood is so cool. It's sexy. But you don't know. Don't say no to Harvard. First go try it out and then make your decision. So I emailed everyone in the Stanford Alumni Database that had anything to do with entertainment animation like five people or so. And they all responded to me because the Stanford Alumni Database and network is very strong. And they gave me all sorts of internships in Hollywood. I quit my job at eBay. I drove down to Hollywood. I took on every single internship I could possibly get my hands on to learn. So I was doing script development with Michael Ellenberg, who is now the HBO drama dude. And also talent manager assistant to Joseph Gore-Levy and Zach Raff and Paul Dino. And I learned from that experience that everything is a business at the end of the day and that my mom is always right. I should go to business school. So I went ahead and went to business school where I ran for a president of entertainment media club. But there I was super angsty to because they are mostly from the East Coast. And they would say, oh, you're that creative person. And I was put in math camp because I didn't come from a finance and consulting background at that time and found my own path there. So internship between business school years is the most important thing you can do in business school. So I applied to Pixar. Ali Rogani, who is a graduate of Stanford's USB, was the CFO of Pixar. And he's like, oh, you should totally come do accounting finance. I hate accounting. So I don't want to do that. I want to get paid minimum wage to bring coffee for the crew of the Pixar staff. But they were angsty about that too because they said, you're from business school. You belong here with the numbers. You're a suit. You're not a creative. So I had to fight real hard to form a path to make sure that I got the internship that I wanted. And the amazing thing there is because I told my boss on Toy Story 3's sets department what it is I want to learn, which was how to become a producer. She designed an internship for me where usually interns get to only stay with one department. I was with a sets department. They make all the environments. You can only stay with one department the whole time. She formed an internship where I could shadow every single department, editorial, art, characters, et cetera. And that's because I told her what it is that I wanted. The point is to always ask for what you want because people in general want to make you happy and want to help you. And if you don't ask for it, it's not going to happen. So especially for ladies out there, you definitely have to do this because dudes just naturally do it not to general way. So I worked on Toy Story 3 in production. And then after that, instead of going back to Pixar because I realized from my newly awesome Harvard Business School education that starting an animation company was really hard. Because if I had one flop of a film, if I didn't have a theme park division to buffer against the loss, my tire company would probably go down. Also, unless I had huge amounts of capital or unfair distribution advantage, it probably didn't make sense to go compete against a Disney Pixar dream works. But I was also attracted to startups. And Pixar was a very mature industry at the time. And I want to be part of something new, creating a new industry. So I joined Zingha right when they started. And was there for six years. And I started off on Farmville and became vice president of games after six years looking over the Farmville franchise. And that was crazy. I did not sleep. And I slept for a while. So night, clicking refresh on my computer at 2 a.m. the morning to see if the numbers are going to go down because they didn't want Mark Pinkas to yell at me. The doors went down because he has a dashboard every morning where he sees every game. And day over day change and week over a week. And if it was red and down, then you were in trouble. So I was constantly clicking refresh as traumatic. But I learned so much that what it meant to be an entrepreneur and what it took to start a company. Because in business school, they teach you to be a certain type of leader, which is very different from what it takes to be a startup leader. It requires different management styles for different types of company. And if you've heard of wartime CEO versus peacetime CEO, it's very relevant. You should definitely read that. It's, I can't remember this, by Ben Horowitz or Andrewson Horowitz. So you should definitely read that because it will turn your thinking upside down on what it means to be a leader. So, but even when I was at Zing, I just loved animation. So a nice and weekends, despite sleeping for hours a day, I worked on a short animated film called The Dam Keeper with my two friends from Pixar. And we made a short film that ended up getting nominated for the Oscars. So that was awesome. I just couldn't stop doing animation, but I couldn't figure out how to make it work from a business perspective. So I had this art side of my brain, right? What I really love, my passion, my idealism. And then I had this super business school, practical Asian parent side of my brain. And what I was trying to do this entire time is figure out, can I merge the two together? Can I be both, or do I have to end up choosing to be one or another? But every single step I took, I try to create my own path in the role that I wanted instead of letting them put me where they wanted to. Which is why I started my old company, because then you can make it whatever you want. So these are my three co-founders. And Eric, like I said, he directed all four Madagascar films and ants in Larry Cutler, Stanford grad, both underground and masters in computer science. And his thesis, I believe, was even on VR back in long time ago, where it was not even commercially viable, but now very relevant. And he went to Pixar when he graduated, a technical director, and then became DreamWorks head of all character technology. And he's a judge for the Oscar technical achievement words. So the reason I put this slide up isn't to brag, even though they're sweet. The reason I put this up is to explain how I got in touch with these people and how the path helped. Eric Darnell, I met through Glenentis. Glenentis is a co-founder of PDI DreamWorks Animation in this former CTO of DreamWorks Interactive and the CEO became EALA, and he was the CEO of DreamWorks Interactive. He was a consultant advisor at Zingha. And as soon as I realized what he did in the past, you will be my mentor. He said, no, I'm retired, I don't have time, and my wife wants me at home, I don't have time for you. And I said, I'm going to become best friends with your wife. And he says, we'll see about that. So it all worked out in friends with his wife. And he's now my advisor. And so when I decided to start this company, I asked him, hey, can you introduce me to Eric? Because he hired Eric into DreamWorks for his first job. Eric was an animation intern and became a big badass director. So he introduced me to him. Now Larry, remember when I said I emailed everyone in the Stanford Alumni Database to get a job? He was one of the people I emailed and he was one of the people who responded. He said, do not go to business school. Actually, everyone said, do not go to business school. And I totally ignored. Really, they said, which he says was a good decision now. He can always justify your past. So Larry, I kept in touch with and I ran into him during a Chinese New Year's parade in San Francisco where he was taking pictures of his daughter, fan dancing. I was like, hey, he's like, what are you doing? I said, I'm starting a company. He's like, oh, maybe I should join you. And that's how it all happens within one month. I found my two co-founders. And then Glenentist introduced me to Alvie Rasmith, the co-founder of Pixar. I emailed him to be my advisor. He's like, listen, Maureen, I hate games. I don't believe in VR. Star is not going to happen. I said, let me just meet you. So I met him at McCraight Vine. I put the headset on him, which is a mobile headset. He's like, I'm going to be your advisor. So it's about persistence and constantly asking. And then he introduced me to Glen Keane, who is my favorite out of all these. I know you're not supposed to have favorites. But he's my favorite out of these because he was a directing animator of Lillomer made, beating the bees, polka hauntes, all those things. They're Tarzan, Tangled, Aladdin. He's the most famous animator alive. So he joined our advisory board as well. Eric, Nume, Meera, Soria, the president. She's now the president of Paramount. She was the president of DreamWorks Animation. And then through all this stuff, I applied to Tribeca Film Festival to show our piece and then became friends with Jane Rose and Thal, who headed up Tribeca Film Festival and is Robert Daniels, producing partner. But the point of all this is, it's all through networking. And it's all through being persistent and asking each person to help you introduce you to another person. And even if they say no, you persist until they say yes because people in general do want to help you. Okay, so then I went about getting investors. And this all happened as well in a month. I had unrealistic expectations. I thought I would get funding in two weeks. And it was, I took me four weeks to get funding, which is really good. But I thought I was a massive failure at three weeks. I don't know. And I was under the covers crying. Like, oh, no, I'm never getting that money for this company. But what was interesting is it was, again, through my network that I got all this investment. The first one who led my series A, 6 million, was Gavin Teo. I knew him because he was a PM at Zingha. And while no one believed at VR at the time, especially not content, he told his bosses, like, hey, it doesn't matter if you even believe in what Maureen's doing, she's crazy. Because I know she was at Zingha and she'll find a way to make money. So just give her money. So it was really helpful that I worked at Zingha with Gavin. And then through the Taiwanese network, so Steve Chang was the founder of Tim Rod, who makes all of EA sports and Madden franchise, EA bought them. He introduced me to Phil Chen, who was a chief content officer of HTC and the person who created the HTC Vive. He introduced me to him because Phil Chen wanted to figure out how to bridge more Taiwanese Silicon Valley connections. We spoke and then he liked what I was doing, introduced me to the CEO of HTC, as she immediately said, I want to give you money. So that was through that Taiwanese connection. Samsung was just at a dinner. I met Ajay Singh, who was the best VC ever, and you should all go seek funding from him. I sat next to him at a dinner. He just really impressed me. And he's like, all right, give me money. And then I know it's making it sound really easy. It's really awful. Fun raising was a worse experience of my life, other than getting broken up with. But it was still a difficult experience. But with the right connections and preservatives, you can do it too. And then Phil Chen eventually went to Horizons Venture, who is the biggest fund in China, along with Alibaba in Tencent. And so he introduced me to the head of the fund there as well. And then Mark Pinkis was my old boss, and I was like, Mark, you owe me farmville, give me money. And so he also introduced me to Peter Teal and through other connections to Yoku. And for entertainment, we have Comcast Ventures. Like I said, 20th Century Fox, Churnin, Peter Churnin, Advanced It is La Ronde by Sherry Redstone, the Chairwoman of Paramount by a Com, and Evolution Media Capital, which is CAA and TPG. So an SMG is the biggest media conglomerate in all of China, because China's where all entertainment's going. So we want to make sure I have access to that market. One thing you'll find interesting here is a teaching business school not to go for strategics. You should go for financial institutions. I found that strategics have been incredibly helpful to me, because I knew that VR was going to take forever. All these people going to pitch these user like, oh, it's here, VR is here. I did the opposite thing. I said, VR is not here. VR is going to take forever. And because of that, I need an investor who's going to stay with me for the long term. Are you the one? Because you should be honored that I'm even talking to you, and you should be honored to give me money. That's the attitude, by the way, you have to take when you're taking money. But the strategics were helpful, because they were invested in VR themselves. So they cared about VR. They needed to succeed, so they need my content. So they can ride out the waves, the bumpy, the hype cycle, the garner hype cycle, the trough of dissolution in all that wave. And so they've provided a lot of help. And they know where things are going, because they have all the data for their headsets. They give me all that information. They tell me what their strategy is. They give me free technology, all that. So it's been actually quite helpful for me to have strategic investors. OK. How many of you are athletes? OK. How many of you are musicians or singer songwriters? How about astronauts? Come on, at least one. OK. So usually, because you guys are young and idealistic and wonderful, you guys actually raise your hands. But usually, if I were to ask this question to a room of adults, nobody would raise a hand. And when you're five years old, you all thought you could be all those things. So the question is, if you don't believe that you can be all these things now, what happened from when you were five to becoming an adult, that made you think that some of these things were no longer possible. Maybe someone told you your sculpture in art class wasn't quite right, or you had a tiger parent who told you you should be more practical. But deep down inside, we believe that everyone has a dreamer's stone side. And we know this to be true, because it's why you guys all go to the movies. It's why you go watch games. Play games is because you want to meet characters and be in situations and scenarios that you wouldn't necessarily encounter in real life. And that is what we care about. And this is why I love animation. I love animation so much that I couldn't stop trying to get back to animation through that entire path. And animation, to me, is all about taking into a completely different world, ones that you could have never imagined in making them feel so real that you think you could reach out and touch it. And those last two sentences that I just said down there takes you to a different world and makes it real, that's the definition of VR and AR, which is why I think that VR and animation and AR are made for each other. And the mission of our company, ultimately, is to bring you back to that five-year-old self that you have inside you to bring out your sense of wonder and inspire you to dream again. Because then you would all go for your dreams. You would realize how much potential you have actually go for it rather than being scared that you can't achieve your dream and what an awesome place the world would be if everyone actually pursued their dreams. So I want to show you really quickly what the company does. And I'll dive into storytelling why I think it's important for humanity and evolution and storytelling as well. At Band-Bab Studios, we're focused on doing immersive storytelling and virtual reality with characters that audiences can fall in love with. When I watch animation, I feel that I'm taken back to that five-year-old sense of self where I thought anything was possible. And our mission is to inspire the world to dream by bringing out your sense of wonder. I had been working for over 20 years directing feature animated films and put on a VR headset for the first time. It blew me away. It's like this un-discovered frontier. We see virtual reality as a new medium for telling stories and creating great cinematic experiences that our character driven. It allows people to be taken to places and to worlds that otherwise wouldn't exist. When audiences saw invasion, they reacted to the world and the characters in ways we never imagined. And that interactivity and that connection and that eye contact was really significant. And we realized we were really on to something. So then when hand controllers came out, we started our next piece, Asteroids, determined to make the viewer a character inside this story that had hands that could actually interact with the world around them. The world of the world. The world of the world. Crow the legend was the piece that we always wanted to do from the very beginning. It started off as a Native American folk tale that was spread through word. And we are turning it into a VR animation to take the story to the next level. Hey, that sounds like Chrome. Another way we look at what we're doing at Bebeb Ep Studios is to take advantage of what we already know about the empathy of filmmaking and cinema and the interactivity of games and the motivation to act that we have in real life when things really matter and we really care. And so when we have all those pieces of puzzle working together, then we have an experience that's unlike an experience you could have in any other media. How many of you have tried VR? Wow, amazing. OK, how about AR? AR is going to have the same problems that VR has, just secret. Anyway, OK. So why did I start this company? So the first time I put on a VR headset, I hated it. I was watching that Paul McCartney music video and was like, oh, you can be right there. But all I can notice was the poor resolution and the pixels because the headsets weren't advanced enough. But when I put on the headset, when I was at Zingha, we hacked our game into it for fun. It wasn't even moving. There was no animated image. It was just a cartoon right in the background. And I realized that this is a future of animation because when you watch animation, it's suspension of disbelief. You don't expect it to look real and you get completely sucked in. So you're not noticing the pixels versus when you're doing real life or special effects. We care so much about whether or not it looks real or not, which is why sometimes if you guys watch the old Final Fantasy movie, it feels kind of weird. You can tell that they're not really human. So I was really excited. Oh my gosh, I need to go do this immediately. I need to join a company. But I couldn't find a company that did what I wanted to do. So that's why I had to start a company. So it wasn't because I always thought, oh, I want to be an entrepreneur because it's really hard. Totally worthwhile. They're really hard. And so I just kind of stumbled my way into it. And I love storytelling. So there's this theory. How many of you have read the book, Sapiens? So there's this theory, evolutionary, theologist, not the others, researchers. Believe that the reason why homo sapiens might have been survival's fittest and one out is because of rumors, which is our ability to tell stories. You can say there's a lion over there, don't go over there, or someone's like, hey, Hector, killed the lion with this chisel in this way. And all the kids around the camp are like, oh my gosh, I want to be just like Hector. It's about putting yourself in another person's viewpoint and putting yourself in another scenario. And you kind of wonder, what would I do if I were in that situation? But in VR, you don't have to wonder, you actually are in that situation. You actually have to act and it reveals who you are. The storytelling is extremely powerful because it gets you to care so much about a character that you want to watch to the end of it, right? Because you want to know what happens to that character. You want them to fail. You want them to succeed. And we believe that VR and AR lets you care about that character even more so than all its previous mediums. So to give you an example, you see this scene right here in Invasion, which is the first experiment that we ever did. This little bunny comes up and sniffs you. Now, this isn't crazy because if you think about, if you watch Deadpool, right, Deadpool comes up and talks to you. It's called Breaking the Fourth Wall. You don't usually, in cinema, break the fourth wall that actors don't acknowledge you because you're in your theater seat and you kind of know that Deadpool's not actually talking to you. But this weird thing happens in VR. People would actually get on the ground and start bouncing around mimicking her emotions absolutely assured that she was reacting to them when actually it was canned animation at the time. They would try to reach out and pet her. They would coup at her. They would talk to her. They would wave at her. And there's this scene where the aliens had their lasers pointed at you and she's hiding behind you and people say, oh my gosh, I'm a bunny shield. I need to save her and sit and I can feel the snow and her breath on my shoulder. And it was really the air conditioning in our office. But they just believed it to be real because when you're in VR, your animal brain makes you believe that this thing is real. And how powerful is that? If you start believing that she's real, how much more do you bond with her? How much more do you want to see what happens? How much more responsibility do you feel you have for her and want to actually help her? And this ended up at the beginning, no one gave us a time of day. We started our company because they're like, no, I want to watch animation and comedy. They only want hardcore zombie shooting games. This ended up becoming the number one downloaded experience across all headsets, beating out all the games, beating out all the licensed IP and all that. And we think it's because of this specific moment because after it, where it's people are like, I want that bunny and we made a plushie bunny so they can hug it, but tell your friends about it. And then if you're a person and you buy it Christmas and you want to share it with your kids or your nieces and nephews or your grandma, what are you going to show them? You're not going to necessarily have them shoot zombies. You love showing them a cute bunny that's going to come talk to you. So we want to take our learnings from that moment when she's making eye contact with you and put that into asteroids and then hand controllers came out. So we said, can we make you not only care about these characters because you believe they're real, but can you do something about that caring now? Turning empathy into action is called compassion. Can we get you to act on behalf of these characters? So in asteroids, you are this menial task where about your lowest of the low. You're in space with mac and cheese or two aliens and with peas is your robot sidekick and you are helping them on your mission but you suck and they don't respect you. But by the end, if you help them enough, you redeem yourself. You have your own little character arc. You save somebody's life and you become a respected member of their team and they vouch you and thank you at the end and you become a respected member. So that was really interesting because we wanted to test with that. But we also learned that interactivity, a lot of people have tried to merge games and film together. It's really hard because when you put interactivity in there, people just want to push all the buttons and interact and they completely ignore the story, right? But by putting interactivity in there, then they become even more immersed. It's trying to figure out that fine line between the two things. So we iterated on Crow. So by the way, we won an Emmy for both invasion and asteroids. So we're really excited about that. And we got Ethan Hawk for invasion and for asteroids. We had Ingrid Nilsen, the famous YouTuber as well as Elizabeth Banks, because I'm all about casting women. And for Crow, the legend, this one's going to launch really soon. It's starring John Legend, who's the star and also executive producer, Oprah, Tai Shardin, from Ready Player One, Constance Wu, from Crazy Rich Asians, and Fresh Off the Bo. My favorite show of all time. Liza Koshi, the top number two YouTuber and also Diego Luna from Rogue One. So we have a sweet, sweet cast. And we are poor. Start, OK, not that poor, because we raised $31 million. But still poor. So stars are, so it's like, how did we have, I have to pinch myself. How did we get all these people to be excited about being in our project? And for them, it was about the themes of this piece. So Crow is based off of Native American tale about how the Crow used to have gorgeous rainbow feathers, colorful feathers, and how he became the Crow that you know to get a black with the calling voice. And basically, what happens is it becomes winter on Earth. Before it was all, it's like Eden, beautiful. It becomes cold. And Crow is the one who has to sacrifice himself by flying into the sun to bring fire and warmth back to the Earth. But in the process, and flying to the sun, his feathers turn all black. They get burned. And his voice becomes like the Crow's voice today. And there are deep Native American themes about sacrifice and community. And what we learned through this process of adapting it is Native Americans were put into reeducation camps and told that they weren't allowed to tell these stories because they were pagan. And so we were really excited about being able to tell these types of stories and partnered with Native Americans and philanthropy in order to tell the story. So we have Sarah Eaglehart, which is the coolest name ever, and also Randy Edmonds, who's a tribal elder, who voice characters in here, but also helped us to make sure that we were true to the original vision. But in this one, we made you the spirit of the seasons. So you are the asshole who makes it winter. So you wave your hands around. Sorry, if I'm allowed to curse. But they say there's a study that said that the more you curse, the more successful of entrepreneur you are. So instead of having you push buttons, because we don't want people when you're in the headset, we don't want you to think, which button do I need to press to make what happen? Because that takes you out of the experience. We decided we wanted it to be seamless. So you don't have to push any button. You just wave your arms around. And that is what incites the action. And so when you wave your hands this way, you make the flowers bloom. And when you wave your hands, you make the snow fall. And so you turn into winter. And you make it so that the animals are frigid and maybe going to die and forcing Crow to go. But we wanted to see if this time, instead of being a fly on the wall or a passive viewer or someone just with arms, what is it like if you have power over these creatures that they don't know you exist, you have responsibility what do you choose to do as a human being. You try to screw with them or you actually try to help them. We're really excited about this piece. As you notice the cast that we cast, I want to make sure that it was an inclusive cast because especially in Hollywood, there are very few minorities or women behind in front of the camera. So that's something that I felt was important, which I also think is very important in VR. Because it's combining two super male dominated industries. You have tech and you have gaming. The two industries that come from. And when we're creating a completely new industry, we have a chance to actually make sure that women are there from the early beginning, which by the way means that there needs to be women where the money's at. Because there was a study I'd to leave from Stanford that showed that a woman who's doing a presentation for pitching to a VC with the same exact pitch deck as a male is, I believe, 40% less likely to get funding. The exact same pitch. And I think the Stanford study was showing slides with a female voiceover versus a male voiceover. Same exact deck. Women was less likely to get funding. So you got to fix that. You guys can do it. So for a lot of ladies, it would be great if you guys didn't only be the ones to start companies, but also are the money. Because that's where a lot of power is at. Like who you decide to fund ultimately. So if there was a little girl crying on a park bench, let's say Central Park, and she's too young to be by herself. If you see her crying in a film, you're going to feel really bad for her, but you're probably not going to get out of your seats, right? And go touch the screen and try to help her because it's in the theater. In a game, you go talk to her, but maybe the reason you talk to her is because you're trying to win. You're trying to get a key, get information to solve a quest, get to the next level. It may be very egocentric. It's a story of you. In real life, you would go talk to her because you genuinely care about her, and you're worried about her, and you want to save her, right? So we believe that VRAR allows you to have the empathy of film where you care so much about that character. You have the agency of games where you can do something about your caring, but you do it because you genuinely care not because you're trying to win. And we think this is the magic of what VRAR gives us, and it's a completely new medium and something that we are super excited about. So I'm just going to conclude. That's why I love VRAR. So I love animation, but the real theme of the entire piece is to not allow anyone to ever bucket you into any category that you can absolutely define your own path. Like every single step of the way, people are trying to tell me, even that picture, every step of the way, people want you to be one thing or another, you just refuse to do that. And you say what it is that you want, and the people around you who respect you will help you get what it is that you want, but you have to say that you want it. Because you all have much more potential than you realize. And as you grow older, you're still young, idealistic, which is great, and keep the news. But there is this tendency for society to try to get you to conform to societal values of money, fame, fortune, beauty. Just resist that. And remember who you are today, because this is the version of yourself and the idealism that you want to keep, especially if you want to start something new. Thank you. APPLAUSE Does anyone have any questions that I can answer? You make me feel like I suck if you don't ask questions, so you have to ask questions. Yolting works great. OK. That's what we do. I'm sorry. What's the word here of biggest takeaways from your time at Harvard Business School? What would one of my biggest takeaways at Harvard Business School? Three things. So one is it gave me confidence in knowing what I didn't know. So I don't remember a thing that I learned at Harvard Business School. Because you learned so many different topics. It's impossible for you to remember everything. But now I know a little bit about every aspect of business. So I know that if I know, in general, when I approach a problem, oh, I need to know more about finance for this thing, then I can go back into my books or look, or I just ask my friend who's really good at finance. That's the other good thing about Business School, of course, is the incredible network that it gives you. The other thing I learned, so therefore, I'm not scared, right, before I'm like, business. What is this business thing? It could be all these things. Now I know what are all the categories or things within business so I feel confident. The other thing is, in Business School, they have you go through real-life cases at CEOs had to go through, for example, like the Tylenol case. So what happened with you found that one of them was tampered with and some a kid ate it and passed away. You're the CEO. What would you do now? What would you do in crisis management? So you deal with these scenarios like five cases a day where you have to raise your hand and say what you would do. By training you do that over and over again every day, it trains a muscle in you of decision making. It teaches you really quickly how you synthesize information and get to an answer as quickly as possible. Though you have to be careful because then you might start only thinking in one way. And the amazing thing about at Business School class is it's affirmative action to the exponential degree where they have, in every single classroom, it's exactly this percentage of women to men, this many oldest children, this many middle children and they're young, this may raise this from all the industries. The reason they do that is because every single person in that classroom will answer the question differently of what they would do as a CEO. And they argue so convincingly that you realize that there isn't a right answer is just who you are in the way you answer. And you realize that strategy is important, but it's actually not as important as being able to align your company around whichever direction you go. Even if you have the perfect strategy, you can't align everyone around it. It's totally useless. It's better have a crappy strategy, at least get everybody rowing in the same direction. And the last thing I learned was a third thing. I can't remember it, but if I do, I'll come back to you. Another question? Do you feel that virtual value will ever be on the foundations for a slide action? I'm biased because of the animation. Why else? Why would you want anything under the animation? I think what VR ever go beyond animation, right? Animation's perfect. You know, you need anything else. Yes, I believe that VR is not just about entertainment. Entertainment happens to be what I'm excited about, but I'm really excited about, first of all, what Jeremy Balanson as Stanford Lab is doing. He's, you look at a mirror in VR and you see that you're a black woman, right? And after when you take off the headset, after you've interacted as a black woman, you feel completely different. You empathize with different races, different cultures. He has this one where you are homeless. You go through the process of becoming homeless. You lose your house, you have to choose which items in your house you want to save and sell and whatnot. It's really, it's amazing. And then afterwards, he's proven that people are more likely to donate to homeless and they have different viewpoints. This whole entire thing I just said about the empathy, in action. You actually care about these faces more. And that excites me because given the world today, I guess people have said that at every single phase of life. The world today, but given the world today and all the differences when you're in that headset, makes you empathize and puts you in somebody else's shoes literally and helps you connect with somebody else. And it just brings out, I believe, our humanity. But medical advances, for sure, like practicing surgery or Jeremy has started his company Striver, for example, a tab, I think Stanford athletes actually practice different scenarios in the line. I don't know anything about it, but go, Stanford. When you're in the lineup, what would you do when people are rushing at you? There's so many. And even think about browsing the web. Now we have this flat screen. If you can browse in VR and 3D, would you actually have filing cabinets or how would you browse? How would you organize things? I think it's going to change absolutely every single industry, not just entertainment. In the back. Yes. And then you. What do you think is the future of VR tech? Like beyond goggles and then a headsets? You say what is beyond? You say what is beyond the future of VR tech? Beyond that sound like the goggles and headsets. What is the future of VR tech? Says like goggles and hand controllers. So the ideal is that you don't have all this equipment, because all this equipment serves to take you out of the experience. You forget that you're totally immersed when you have to fumble around with buttons. Or you have this big, super heavy thing on your head that is awful for women with bangs, or for tiny heads, because they're made for larger heads. Right now, we're moving towards the next generation of headsets. Oculus Connect was last week. Just announced their wireless headsets, six degrees of freedom, so that you can look and move in every single direction that's run on a unit. That's not a cell phone or PC. Everything else was previous generation of headsets. We're always tethered to say a mobile phone or to a PC. Something that wasn't built for VR. And now they're creating standalone headsets that are made specifically for AR and VR, so that's great. But it's still big and heavy, so exciting when we don't have that. And the exciting thing about the next generation doesn't have wires. Because it's really difficult right now to set up all the headsets. You have to mount the light stations. You can't have too shiny mirrors, objects, the rest of messes up the positional tracking. You might walk into a wall. And all these difficult things. And so they're working on all these different areas to make it easier. But I'm hoping eventually it's like the holodeck where you have where anything. And you just interact freely. And maybe just you wear the clothes and the clothes automatically like ready player one or so. You're ready in the experience without me and put anything on. And then you had a question. All right, so I just want to know what tools you use to escape the box. And if you feel like your artistic minds be trapped by more logical and rational science in the future of the game. What do you do when you feel like you're trapped in the artistic box or logical box your artist is contained? Basically, is that, am I asking the question correctly? OK. What I do is I draw. That's what I learned at eBay. I didn't. I just kept on drawing every day, whether it's for five minutes or 10 minutes. Because I thought I didn't want to lose the artistic side of me. But the strange thing is it actually made me think more creatively on a business strategy point of view because everything starts blending together. And I think that was one of the greatest strengths of the major that I created. You would think that psychology, our and computer science are so different. But I learned that they're all actually underlying theories similar. It's about when I learned about paradigms, right? When you're painting, do you start with the fuzziness first and then go into detail, or do you start in light in shadows, or do you start with the details first and go, why? Same with coding. Do you start with object oriented or straight forward? Like all these different things. You start realizing that they're connections between all disciplines that you didn't know were there. And it helps you think at a higher, more abstract level. Know that sounds really abstract, but trust me. So when you do try to do things other than what you do normally in your job, I do think that it makes you better at your existing job. Really one more. OK. All the way in the back there. So what's the question about the programming? How much does the audience have control over the plus? Do you have two story artists and the spirit and they're good at it? Not the need of the plus. How do you control the movement of the plus? Given the idea that the audience can be that's the question one. And questions to it. Is there any two way connections from the animation to the audience? Like are you rich on anything that makes you feel that the physicality? I don't know what is up. Is there anything else that comes out? OK. We have a two part here. So number one is how much control and agency do you have in the experience? And do you have feedback back from the animation, like feeling touched and things like that? So for the first one, every single experience that we've done has been different. And there's not one right way. In some, you have the only interactivity where the game engine detects where you are is where you are in the scene. And then the other characters follow you with the eyes. That's the only interactivity in invasion. With Astorase, you literally have hand controllers. And you actually, you can decide to save the alien or not. In that one, we made it so that even if you don't, the other character rips off your arm and does the right thing anyway. But the audience doesn't know that it's still going to happen the same way no matter what. But the ending does change because you no longer become a respected member of their team. So you no longer have your awesome character arc because you didn't, you did nothing. So instead of branching narrative, we thought about it as branching emotions. The relationship that you have with the character changes based off of what you do and don't do. And about the two way feedback, right now, the feedback is dependent on the controllers and the devices that you have. And the best we can have right now is like rumble pack. It rumbles. And then you have like sound feedback and visual feedback. But the only haptic feedback so far is that rumble. That being said, people are creating jackets and different types of things that can give you different types of feedback as well. And people are also working on olfactory devices that actually give you like smells based off of what you do as well.
