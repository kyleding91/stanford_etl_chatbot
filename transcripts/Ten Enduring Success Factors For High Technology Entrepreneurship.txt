 You are listening to the Draper Fisher-Jurvinson entrepreneurial thought-leader seminar, brought to you weekly by Stanford Technology Ventures Program at Stanford University School of Engineering. Without further ado, I get to introduce our speaker today. We are extremely lucky to have Tom Buyers here to give a talk. How many of you know Tom Buyers or have seen Tom Buyers in class? Okay, this is a good sign. You've come back. Okay? You are lucky. Tom, you have his official bio in front of you and I certainly am not going to read it to you. I just want to tell you that I have had the privilege of working with Tom for the last sixth and a half years. And to just put that in context, I used to change careers every two years whether I needed to or not. And because of Tom, I have not left STDP. Tom is the academic director and I, every single day, get the opportunity to work with him. The one thing I want to just tell you on a personal note about Tom is that it's important for you to understand that 11 years ago, Tom left a very successful career in industry because he became passionate about teaching and passionate about basically building the next generation of entrepreneurs. And you all get to benefit from all of the work that he's put in. Every single day, Tom comes in with the sole mission of figuring out the most innovative, creative and appropriate ways to teach students here at Stanford. And this is a talk that he's put together and is given all over the planet on the 10 enduring lessons of entrepreneurship. So without further ado, here's Tom. Thank you. Thanks for coming. Here we go, checking 1, 2, 3. So promise me, I've sat in enough of these in the back to realize that sometimes the levels of the volume were not right. So do a timeout sign or something like that if the volumes aren't correct. Are they okay? Can you hear me? Okay? Yeah? Good? All right. But if something changes, just do this and we'll stop right there because I want everybody to be tortured by what I'm about to say over the next half an hour or so. So it feels really odd to be here as the speaker rather than one of the introducers because I was away in the autumn as a matter of fact, you see this here in the next slide. I actually spent the autumn at the London Business School. So Tina talked about our association together with the Stanford Technology Ventures program. But I had the pleasure of working in England teaching not only at London Business School, but also a few engineering schools, University College London, Oxford. I got to go up to University of Edinburgh and actually do a version of this talk. But it's normally I'm up here as part of my duties at Stanford Technology Ventures program to help introduce the speakers, which you will see me up here doing that exact thing next Wednesday at 4.30. So it feels like a bizarro day or something to be the person that has to entertain you up over the next hour or so. So I'll try to follow the format that most people do, which is talk for about a half an hour as famous last words because I have a lot of content to share. And I've been thinking about this and working on this ever since last week when we had, if you notice some of the posters, it was a bait and switch situation. We did have another speaker online to come and be with us today. They couldn't make it the last second and somehow Tina gave me a call and drafted me into this. But it's a real honor and a real privilege to be able to talk about some of these things with you. So I guess what I'm going to be doing is talking about these ten enduring success factors. I'm going to be talking about high tech entrepreneurship, which is sort of the theme of this seminar series and has been for years. How many of you have been to one of these before? I know it's the first one of the quarter. How many have you never been to one of these? Whoa! Oh, okay. I hope that I do a good enough job where you'll come back because they're every Wednesday afternoon all year long and they're just spectacular. I have a lot to live up for. I'm really anxious right now and have been all weekend. Just ruined my Martin Luther King day weekend because I've been anxious because of quality of who you're going to meet in here and I'm going to refer to a few of them as I'm talking about this. It's just spectacular. So anyhow, the enduring part of this is that, you know, I've been, she mentioned, I've been at Stanford for ten years or eleven years or so and it was really wild. They get here in 1995 and to be here to 2000, that was, it's commonly referred to as the bubble years. There's an amazing economic expansion in the technology field and it's sort of to be an observer, which is essentially what we do as educators and try to think about, well, what's the essence of entrepreneurship though in that kind of condition? We got to see that and then we got to see just, you know, full body slam of the economy in this region for sure and almost everywhere that anything to do with technology between the year 2000 and recently and now we're just sort of getting back to steady state. So what's been enduring to that is fact, you know, success factors for the people that you get to meet in here or the other kinds of entrepreneurs. So I put it in the curriculum that I've been teaching here over the last ten years and having influence, you know, Tina and I have influence on other people who teach entrepreneurship. I hope all of you are taking full advantage of the courses that are offered in the engineering school as well as a business school, and the med school and so forth. And we all worked very hard on that curriculum but I also decided to do a textbook and this red thing here in the middle is from McGraw Hill and I had a wonderful time writing it. We shipped it the first edition just a little less than two years ago. So I'm right now I'm in the midst of writing the second edition to hopefully get it done by getter done as they say, by Christmas time. And one of the reasons I went to London and spent the fall there was to make the textbook more international and sort of think through, okay, not just enduring success factors of high tech entrepreneurship but what about, you know, what's given that the world is flat as the common term now is and the death of distance and so forth, how to make that book not just about Silicon Valley technology ventures but really about those around the world. We had a chance to go around a conference for example in Beijing last summer and get to spend July there and getting to meet a lot of entrepreneurs there as well. All right, so it's a top 10 list and you know with all due apologies to David Letterman, you know, I'm not going to be that funny. And but I did like the way that Guy Kawasaki who many of you maybe have seen speak before, he does that. It's fantastic the way he says, you know, he does top 10s because he says, you know, if you're bored, you've heard this before, if you're bored, if I'm not like a number three, you know, you only seven more to go. So you can always just subtract wherever we are from 10 and you know how far we have to go. So I'm going to use some examples. It's really in a set of questions that just what I've tried to encapsulate is take the whole field of high tech entrepreneurship and boil it down. I'm not that sophisticated a person. I've had to like try to take it down and really just try to simplify it into 10 points and I'll put them as questions and then talk about each one and maybe you know, maybe you'll resonate with you or maybe we can you know have some dialogue about this after I'm done during Q&A or anytime in my office hours, which are you're all invited to my office hours. We can all try to fit in my office just three floors up. You need Monday afternoon and talk about this. All right, so the first one is what's the difference between an idea and opportunity? So this is kind of the mega question. This is just sort of like, well, what is high tech entrepreneurship after all? So first of all, let's talk about high tech and just great ideas. That is a picture I ripped off from our dean of the School of Engineering's recent presentations because it is where Stanford is investing in terms of basic research. I hope many of you in this room because it looks like very much a student population and that's awesome and many of you watching are into one of these things because the university certainly is. I mean, there's hundreds of millions of dollars being invested here at Stanford and basic research in one of these four areas as well as at my alma mater at Berkeley and MIT and Georgia Tech. What I saw at Oxford in Cambridge and so forth, what I saw at Chiang Wai in Beijing, this is very hot areas. I would love to be young again. I mean, if you think that most of my examples I'm going to use are from things I did when I was in industry and so forth that I saw firsthand, but oh my God, I'd love to be ready to have another 50 year career because stuff whether it's an IT or nano or bio or even my favorite one here, the environment and energy is just super exciting. The technology is involved and as Tina was reminding me this morning in a meeting, it's really the intersections of these. Okay, so great idea is a comment. I mean, they're all over the place. So, what's this thing called opportunity? So, I would like you to oblige me and let you show you something from a project that we do along with a fellow named Forest and some other people upstairs called the Educators Corner and it's a video. It's a video from a very famous venture capitalist who's spoken in here before named Vinod Kosla. He's also an entrepreneur, he created Son, he helped create Juniper Networks. Let's hear what he has to say about opportunity. And I hope this works. It's a very short clip and just as my own kind of time out for a second, we have hundreds of those clips loaded on something called edcorner.stanford.edu. So many different wonderful launch winners. As a matter of fact, the speakers in here, that's the source of those video clips and we put them into sound bites and we give them away for free. So, please enjoy more of those if you like that one and all kinds of other people. But anyway, into the advertisement. But did you hear what he had to say? He said, you know, every big problem. I mean, there's no opportunity to listen. There's a big problem. So wait a minute, so there's ideas and then there's problems. So how are we going to put some sanity around this? And I really do enjoy thinking since entrepreneurship is such a big topic. And even when you narrow it down, say no, no, no, we're just going to talk about high-tech entrepreneurship, you know, high potential entrepreneurship, what makes the Googles happen, what makes the genetics happen. That's still a gigantic topic that just transcends all these departments at these universities. It's written about every day in all the major newspapers, almost like it's a sport, you know, like it gets to be like reading the business section, so it's like reading the sports section, for example, or entertainment section. So it's written about, it's studied by scholars all over the world. So what about it? So I got to put, I just have to put some sort of framework around it and that's how we build it as a curriculum and teach it as a process. So it can be taught. Entrepreneurs aren't born, they're made. Entrepreneurs can they be taught hell, yeah, because they can learn. It's that simple. And so this, our job is educators and we know the most of them around the world and so it's such a noble profession to be part of, but it's difficult to come up with, okay, how you're going to explain this stuff. So this is a friend at Babson, which is a school in the suburbs of Boston. And he says, look, let's look at entrepreneurship this way. So we're still in this first question, this mega question of difference between idea and opportunity. This is okay, we got this notion of opportunity, but let's break it down a little bit more. Entrepreneurs evaluate and recognize opportunities with this collision up top here between, okay, ideas and products, colliding with problems with what, you know, Vinod called market opportunities. All right. Then they don't really think too much at the time as they're evaluating recognizing what they're going to do in terms of money and talent. So that's this pursuit of opportunity where they know it's okay. We haven't thought about much of this yet, but now we're going to have to gather some resources, which is as old as any capitalism discussion or anything. I mean, it's decades of not centuries old. In other words, capital and talent. So if we break it down this way, the rest of my chat with you is going to be three of them having to do with sort of the top part, three of them having to do with finance and three having to do with team. And this is just a sort of way to keep it in your mind as we step through it. And I'm assuming these slides will post them up on the ETL site. And for those of you who are also brand new, this is archived. And you can, if you liked it so much this time, you can go back and watch it again. And I can't get this crowd to laugh. All right. Anyway, I'm going to keep trying, though, not it. So anyway, so we'll post the slides up there. Let's do three having to do with the collision of products and markets, all right? So the first one is why do ventures require dynamic leaders? But I said I'm talking about products and markets. Well, of course, every one of these has to do with humans because that's what's creating these companies. So the top part really has to do this notion of the collision of ideas and problems and what comes out of that really has to do with setting a vision. And you hear people in here talking about that saying, what is the purpose and mission of our company, of our venture, of our enterprise? And then they say, where's our strategy in order to achieve that? So what I love, and I hope you watch that, is we have a speaker here the rest of the year just talk about that. Or ask him, say, hey, what's your vision? And how do you set a strategy before you start executing? It's the old, ready, fire. No, I'm sorry. Ready, aim, fire. Excuse me. Ready and fire, meaning ready being vision, aim being strategy, fire being execution. So how many times have you seen people go like ready, whatever I said the first time, fire, aim, aim after they fired? It's that type of thing. So great leaders have this wonderful ability of keeping that in mind. Vision drives strategy, which drives execution. And here's another thing that's really cool in observing entrepreneurs and management teams, especially the CEOs and founders. They have to evolve as people. I mean, just like you're going through major transformations, being students or whatever stage of life you're in in terms of professional development, they have to as well. And it's really interesting to watch and track that. I get to teach, I'm a lucky person, I get to teach a class, the one I'm teaching right now with a fellow named Randy Komasar, who's been in this seminar series many, many times over the years. Thank goodness. And Randy's a venture capitalist now. He's done many, many things over his life as well. But he wrote this book called Munk and Riddle. I highly recommend it. It's a lot more fun to read in this red book that I wrote. I ended up, I got a laugh there. And so Randy has this wonderful metaphor. How many of you own pets? How do a pet or you have just a love with a pet? Good, thank you. Because I do too. And I love my cat. And Randy loves his dogs. And so he has this way of talking about CEOs as dogs. I know that sounds funny. But he lovingly as dogs. And he says there's three kinds of CEOs. He says there's like three kinds of dogs. Retriever, Bloodhound, and Husky. And they have to evolve. In other words, the retriever has to evolve to be a bloodhound, which has to evolve to be a Husky. If they're going to continue to be CEO. So let's talk about that a minute. So a retriever is like the initial founder of the company, the initial CEO. They have to go out and trade stock, which is all they got. They have to go out and get the equity for ideas, for some a little bit of money, a little bit of talent to get the thing going. And then in craft division, like we talked about, then the Bloodhound has to, you know, as the next kind of CEO a company needs to go sniff out a trail. And that's sort of like setting a strategy. And then lastly, as a company grows, the Husky needs to take over. So what you're going to see in here, because it's, you're just going to get people at a point time. And what we've seen in here for the last eight years that we've been doing this, and storing them up on the website and chopping them up in these video clips, is people who were really good at being a Bloodhound. I mean, you know, like a retriever or Bloodhound, but maybe not so good at being a Husky. Or they realized that and they turned it over. So let's talk about Larry Page, for example. What was he? Well, he was a retriever to begin with, is he in Sergei got Google started down in University Avenue? Pretty good Bloodhound in setting out the strategy to determine about the whole, you know, notion of ad words and so forth. But when the company became 200 people, was about five years ago, he turned it over to Eric Schmidt. A very compatible CEO, who was the Husky, who's brought that company along, you know, to where it is today, and it's, you know, it's all its glory. And I could go in that example, after example, of some people who can make that full transition. I mean, Bill Gates, you could argue as sort of the previous generations of Google, you know, sort of made that transition all through the 80s and 90s. And so it's fascinating. All right, so let's take this, keep this rolling, the interest of time. So the next one I chose for this section of the, of, you know, this top half of the, of the framework is context. And, you know, by the way, choosing 3 for each one was really, really hard. And it's really, it's fun because I keep thinking about it and meeting people and getting feedback. And I hope you'll give me feedback on them as well. And I'll give you a way to reach me here at the end. This one's context. And it says, you know, how does context play a role in high tech? And there's those rapids there. Context is all the things outside of the control of the management team, of the entrepreneurs. What they can't control. And man, you know, that's kind of freaky because a lot of entrepreneurs have been, you know, their type A personalities or something like that. And they, they love being in control, but they're really good ones. Realize that man, there's a lot going on. But I can't control. And so how do I navigate through that? How do I deal with regulation, you know, government regulation? How do I deal with economies like I talked earlier going really, really well when it was super easy to raise money as an entrepreneur in the late 90s. And then it got very, very difficult. How do I turn that into as, as I hear over and over in our office upstairs is how do you turn a problem into an opportunity like that? If you face something like a difficult recession or think of the geopolitical concerns that have been going on since 9-11 over the last four or five years and what's that done for what it means to be an entrepreneur. I am in awe of these biotech companies and medical technology companies who do this because not only do they face the same stuff in terms of economies, ebbing and flowing or geopolitical tensions and so forth, but they're also facing an onslaught of regulation. And I know any of, I mean most of you who have any paying any attention at all to biotech and med tech, you know, realize that. So my hats off to the genetics of the world which is now the most admired country in the my admired company in the country. And that's 35 years old, but let's just talk about one recently. I got a chance to interview my brother up here and it was a real honor to do that. And he was involved in a company called as an investor and something called Genomic Health. And this is last spring and for those of you who are with us, we even mentioned it that our mom had died from breast cancer. And Genomic Health has this way, it's one of the bellweathers of this part of medicine called personalized medicine which is targeting different therapies and diagnostic tools to certain people based on your characteristics. So maybe you don't need a woman who has breast cancer, maybe you shouldn't only get chemotherapy if it's absolutely necessary. That's sort of thing because chemotherapy is a very dangerous kind of thing. So that's a layman's interpretation of that. But the company is called Genomic Health and guess what? The CEO is coming. But two or three weeks from now, the CEO Kim will be here and it's just a fascinating company. Man, have they navigated context for the last few years? Are they public now? They go look them up on Google. You're going to be blown away by the success they've had. When everybody said, don't store companies. Don't be doing companies during this terrible recession. And as a matter of fact, it's been proven over and over again, great companies always get started in recessions. If you go back and plot recessions versus the founding dates of some of the enduring companies. All right, I'm going to hit the accelerator here a little bit. I've got so much stuff I want to tell you. I'll just try to pick and choose. This one has to do with marketing. It turns out that in startups and all the ones I've been associated with, and either when we were starting up some antech or slate or when I've been a board member at once, everybody's really obsessed with getting the product done as they should be or the service. I mean, we're starting the technology into something useful. No question. It got to happen. R&D is very, very important. It's a necessary condition. It's not sufficient. Everybody's obsessed about sales because we've got to generate some sort of revenue right away. And you would want them to be that way. Sales is really important. What gets lost out of the picture a lot of times is this notion of marketing. What you'll learn about, if you went to business school, there'll be marketing classes. We have a great marketing class here in the engineering school taught by a whole team of people, Tom and Donna and so on. But marketing in the real world is just sort of seen as kind of the backseat, the ugly duckling. And that could be as far from the truth as what really, really happens in successful companies. They do an amazing job of figuring out how we're going to compete, who we're going to sell stuff to exactly, who's really are we serving, and how we're going to partner in order to do that. And so a friend of all of ours in this room, because he's a Stanford grad, he's an English major. You've seen him speaking this room before, Jeff Moore popularized this model, which most of us who teach this stuff absolutely love. How many of you have seen this model called Cross in the Cazin before? Have you seen it? Oh great, not many of you have. Well then I urge you to buy one of his book, it's cheap. It's not, again, it's not a textbook. It's one of these, read on the airplane. And it is, it's more or less, it's the Bible. Still, after 15 years of entrepreneurial marketing. And it goes along this notion that everything that's radical, every innovation that's really a brave new world that really changes the game, goes through a set of time before it gets adopted, everything. I mean, even digital music players. I've asked you now, how many of you have an iPod or digital music player? You say, sure I got one. If I'd asked you that question two years ago, it wouldn't be the same. I've asked you two, four years ago, it wouldn't have been many at all. Because only four years ago did people in this area, the early adopters have that. Well it turns out, everybody thought that technology's just got adopted really smoothly. But they don't. There's this Cazin. You see that break between sort of the early market and the main screen market where wealth and success really is? There's a break there. So this fellow developed a method in a way of talking about how to get across there with all kinds of metaphors of bowling, alley, tornado, and main screen. I guess my point is this is what I noticed over and over is that partnering is one of the keys to that. And I had a chance in the 90s to see a bunch of people, a bunch of entrepreneurs, range of partnership with another company that people said you could not partner with that just blew me away. And I got to watch it really closely because I was a board member for the whole get-go. The company was in Seattle. It was called Visio. VISIO. It's now a product line at Microsoft but just to spend that for a minute. It was a graphic software package and it was a separate company for 10 years all the way through the 90s. And it ran only on Windows and it was a drawing package and flow charting and work charts and things like that. Well they did an amazing job of getting Microsoft who, if you don't think Microsoft is well likes now, you should have seen them in the 90s. That was when they were being sued by the government and all this kind of stuff or being monopolistic. So nobody wanted to work with Microsoft because you know those ruthless folks and you'll never be able to create a situation where it's 1 plus 1 equals 3. It was amazing to watch these folks from Visio pull that off and do great sales, promotions together, do great marketing campaigns together. Now it turned out after 10 years of dating, they actually got married. The relationship went to another level and Microsoft bought them. But even during the period it wasn't about, hey let's do this so we get bought by Microsoft someday. It was, look, partnerships are key. The way to get across that chasm, we need to partner with Microsoft, we're going to make it work. All right, so let's do 3 now having to do with financial stuff. This is the first time and since I got the bully pulpit here, I just used the word business plan. Here I am talking about entrepreneurship and I haven't used the word business plan yet. That's pretty wild because most people equate the two. I know as educators we also talk about this that you know some almost every university has a business plan competition. We have a great one too that actually several as you know that basis runs. But they think that that's the extent of entrepreneurship education or out in the real world people think this is all that's necessary for an entrepreneur to do to raise money from somewhere else. Okay? So what I want you to do is turn to a friend, somebody sitting right next to you and come up with another reason to do a business plan. Other than raising money. Just turn to any friend and say what's another reason to raise money. Just pick one. It's class time. Okay. So other than raising money from an investor which is what most people think of, how many of you said something to do with okay it's a way to attract investors but it also might be a way to attract customers or employees or partners. How many of you said that one? Might be a way. Okay. How many of you said it might be a good way to just you know channel you're thinking about the business itself and then track your progress. Okay great. And which ones did I miss? Anybody have any others? Like to share? Yeah. Identify future chances which is sort of related to thinking through the business. Yes. Identify new opportunities. Great. So I'm glad that you immediately identified that there's more to it than that. And I also wanted to show my favorite framework. A prank, frankly of all entrepreneurship. It comes from a paper written, I'm actually shocked. I just looked at it written in 1997 from a professor at Harvard called How to Write a Great Business Plan. And I love the tagline. It says which information belongs and which doesn't may surprise you. It's very very shorting order it from a Harvard Business School or just Barrett from somebody who's taken one of our classes because certainly in my class it's a sign along with the textbook and Randy's book. And this is just a pictorial diagram of it and without a lot of time here. It just shows that some people might think that the business plan, only thing that's important about that is getting a deal done. It's getting something, some money out of some investor to make something happen. And in fact, it's a set of questions that have to be answered. So the whole, I don't know, ecosystem of a venture has to be an alignment. The opportunity has to be an alignment with resources and people in the context we talked about, the economic environment and so forth, regulatory environment, with the deal. When they're in alignment, the deals will get done. It has nothing to do with whether the business plan is super polished or spiffy or anything like that. So let's go to the next one having to do with finance. So business plan is much more than just finance. That wasn't point at that point. This is this one where there's that famous saying cash flow is more important than your mother. Yeah, mother. Or you can put in something else if depending on your relationship, your mom. I'll put my cat would go there. Cash flow is more important than my cat. And this is a sound bite from entrepreneurship that happens to have some legs in it. And I wrote down some notes about this because I really, this is so important. I wanted to not forget something. Look, when you're managing a small company, or when somebody is managing a small company, that's just really different than managing a big company. In a lot of ways, but one thing is a lot of ways is one thing is you can't. You have to be concerned about cash. If you're running a big company, yes, you're performance and getting it done and all that. Yes, it makes sense. But the company, the big company is not going to run out of cash because of you. But if you're running a small company, you just may run a cash. And since it is the heart pressure, to coin a medical phrase or the heartbeat, it's the blood pressure of the company. When you're out, it is game over. And that is just such a different feeling than working in a big company. And that's why sometimes big company executives who have tried to go and run and be part of the team and a young company have a difficult transition, not realizing that. What they spend it on, when entrepreneurs spend it on, is really telling. And I hope that I hope I convince you that during the rest of the winter and spring, I'm not doing any favors for the future speakers here. But I hope I convince you to ask questions like, okay, what do you spend your money on right now? Because cash is your blood pressure. It's so precious. There's one thing you can't run out of. It's the only financial parameter that matters in a startup. You're spending it on. Because that'll be interesting to watch just how crisp the answer is. We're spending it on reducing the risk in our technology. Or we're spending it on reducing the risk of our marketplace. And you get to know our customers. Or we are spending on the risk of the fact that we don't really have a full team right now. I mean, our team is only half baked, in terms of the kind of talent we have, and we need to change that. I think of people who did this. I mean, Palm did this really well. We've had Jeff Hawkins here, and along with Donut Ebenzki, really created the whole field of Palm computing by creating the first personal digital assistant. And I happened to know a little bit about all that and knew Jeff at the time in Donut because we were in that same sort of space. I had started a company after slate. I mean, after semantic called slate, and we didn't do so well. And we just spent too much money. I didn't follow my own advice. And I was just amazed how Donut and Jeff, and Jeff, you've seen him up here, the sky's just amazing, smart. One thing he and Donut were really good smart is they cocooned as the word they used to use. And really, really, really careful. We're super frugal. As that market, it just didn't, it was, we had a chasm problem. The whole notion of writing on small devices, handheld devices, writing with a pen, all that. And we had a lot of time to get going, battery life, and handwriting recognition took a long time. But they were able to cocoon to do that. When I was in London recently, I was really impressed by the startups there. I hung out with a startup that is located in Israel as well as London. And they're in the space that might be tangentially related to eBay. I mean, that's not necessarily the important thing. But it's a startup. 20 people. I mean, and I'll put it in dollars instead of pounds. But they're spending less than $100,000 a month for these 20 people who are somewhere between London and Israel. London, have you been to London lately? It's expensive. You know, it is really expensive. It's like living in New York. So you can't just say, hey, London's a cheap place to live because that ain't true. At first hand, knowledge. Maybe Israel is a little less expensive, say the Silicon Valley. But what I liked about that is 20 people doing 100,000. It's unheard of here in Silicon Valley. 20 people, oh, 10,000 per head per, and this per for each month. For one month would be 200,000. And that's probably, well, that would be seen as a well run company, 200,000. And it probably not so well running, a little sloppy, maybe, and they're spending will be 250 to 300,000 dollars. This is a lot of people are talking about this. This is not, you know, India or China or anything like that. So there are people who really get this and they really drive it home. Let's do one more on finance. So I couldn't do one without talking a little bit about this. You know, where does money come from? I mean, I mean, maybe we'll talk about the Bloodhound or the retriever, the retriever, the retriever, the first dog to get the company started. And they got a trade stock for ideas, capital, and talent. Well, let's talk about how they trade stock for capital. These are the sort of different sources of capital. And it's a lot of fun in our classes to dive down and talk about the pros and cons of each one of these. And you'll hear that a lot in here as well. I mean, for example, there's angel investors, which is just wealthy investors, you know, individuals. There's corporate venture capital, which is something like Intel. There's the traditional VC, like the Sequoias, Nick Salis, and Clindor Perkins. And then there's bootstrapping, which is either personal funds or convincing a customer to pay you some funds up front. So, and then there's other, which, what do you think other is for a moment? What's the public? If a company ever gets really, really successful, they can go public, and that becomes an investor and, you know, for growing the company. And what got really weird five years ago is the public was really interested in getting involved super early on, whether it was tons of risk, until everything kind of unraveled. So you know, there's pros and cons of each one. We could sit here for another half an hour and talk about that. And it's really a lot of fun to do that. The traditional VC, what's the pro? Well, they got lots of money to deploy, you know, and for people who are really going to go for something and really change the world. They got lots of money to deploy, and they got lots of expertise to bring to the table and help. And you'll hear that over and over here and again. But what's the downside of VC? It's really expensive money. I mean, the terms of delusion and the ownership that's going to have to be given up in order to have them involved. We could do that across the board. So the other thing, do I have this nod? The other one I want to mention here is over and over we see the following. And it's really fun to do this when we're teaching this material. It is a process. All the stuff is a process and a set of mechanisms. This notion of venture capitalists and entrepreneurs getting together and cutting a deal like it's some sort of television show or something like that is really way offline. You know, getting the best price like it's a used car. What really goes on and over and over again, it's not the best price that gets the deal done. There's been academic research on this and there's been, you know, just layman research done on this that shows that rarely does an entrepreneur take the best price from a venture cab. Meaning, you know, they get the most money for the least amount of ownership given up. It's all the other stuff, all the other terms and conditions that come into play about how they're going to help each other be successful. Have you seen this? I got one laugh. I've got four more to go. All right. Have you seen this picture? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good, cool. So it is. Who is it? It's Microsoft. So even Microsoft was a team. So this, where is, all right, since we're at Stanford and many of you maybe go take classes in the Paul Allen building, the double E building, which one's Paul? Got to know that, I mean, there's term in up there. So which one's Paul and the for the Paul Allen building? Unibomber. Got that one then. All right. And who's this? Yes, exactly. And so this is a long time ago. So even Microsoft, everybody thinks Bill Gates, Bill Gates, Bill Gates, Bill Gates was a team. And I know Bill, if he was here, would absolutely echo that. It's just a myth to say that Steve Jobs started Apple. And he'd be pissed off if we were saying that in here as well. I went to see him honored at a Harvard event. And he refused to go on stage. He was getting a lifetime achievement award. He brought his entire management team from Apple on the stage, all 14 of them. And it made them interview all 14, not him, because he said, oh, come on. Apple's not me, whether it's the Mac or whether it's the iPod and so forth. So it's really cool. And I don't know. We try to shy away from metaphors, whether they're sports metaphors or even worse war metaphors and describing entrepreneurship. But this is one I just couldn't resist. It's a team sport. I had that opportunity to see this firsthand when I was at Symantec. It makes the antivirus products it didn't have began with. I mean, just think of it. Maybe you've sometimes wondered when you've used Norton to go, where the hell did they get the name Symantec? Well, because we raised money as an artificial intelligence company. Symantec's get it Symantec. Because we were going to do front-end natural language English commands to databases. There was some technology here from Stanford. And you know, we built a product for personal computers. It did okay. It was never going to be a public company. It certainly never was going to be a very big company. And I had the opportunity as one of the general managers and executive vice presidents to say, go off and we got to find some other pastures to graze in. And I got lucky in hiring some good people. The rest of the team filled in. We had great operations people and sales people. We got in the antivirus business in the 80s. And now it's like a fourth largest software company in the world. And we combined with Veritas, having to do with security. It was all about the team being adaptive. Otherwise we would not have been very, we would have been also ran software company. So the flip side, this is a two for one today on number eight. I feel like a 802.11 or something. 8.1 and 8.2. The 8.2 is how can reward systems and company culture inspire innovation. And I'll just jump to the most important point out here because of time. There's a professor that we get to teach with who has a great way of putting this. And they say innovation, which is really the siren song of everybody, whether they're in entrepreneurial startups or big companies. They say innovation is, and this is good because I'm an old engineer. The lover of engineering staff is a function of creativity and teamwork. Innovation is a function of creativity and teamwork. So all the stuff is this my way of looking at the world to try to categorize all this and keep this stuff straight as I read all these wonderful things about entrepreneurship. Function of creativity and teamwork. So let's do this again. Creativity is really, really important. Oh my God, Tina C. Lee is the best professor I've ever seen. She teaches a class in the spring. We're going to get you up here in the spring and talk about her class. It's amazing. But I bet you would be nice to argue, but it's only a necessary condition to be innovative. It's not sufficient once again because it must have teamwork. And I have really enjoyed coming back to be an educator. But certainly when I was in Silicon Valley, as a man taking slate or now I'm on boards, the directors, the companies, is it comes down to that how do you take a group of people and turn them into a really kick ass team? I mean, Stanford's women's basketball, Stanford men's basketball. Here's the other sports analogy, the last one I promise. It's just proven that over and over again since I've been here. I mean, you're just amazing. And being a Cal grad has been painful because I mean, Cal hasn't won a game here since I was young. So, and it's always been because of the team concept. Stanford basketball men and women have never had necessarily superstars compared to the rest of the country. It's been of that because they have very creative and they combine it with teamwork and then therefore the innovative. And that's the same thing goes for high tech. All right, two more. How many of you have ever sold anything? Whether it's in a restaurant, retail, in high school, anything, just sold anything, anything, whatever, that is so good to see that most of you have. Because you probably appreciate what a noble profession that is. I said teaching was a noble profession, but selling as well. And a lot of people don't get that. I mean, it's just recently that business schools, including our own great one across the campus, is now beginning to teach sales. I mean, courses in sales. I had courses in marketing, that courses in accounting, so forth finance. But now there's some great courses being built in sales. Because it is fundamentally important to entrepreneurship as well. I mean, I said marketing was as well, but this is it. And this is really about skills, as well as marketing is about strategy. The skills here are things like negotiation. And that's why we've offered a negotiation class that's super popular by Stan and Chrischus and now twice a year, open to all undergrads and grads. I hope so, hope I said that right. Or other sales skills are things like influence and persuasion. It's really applied psychology. I sure wish I'd taken more psychology classes when I was at Cal. I was undergraduate in engineering. I just avoided anything I do with sociology and psychology. But ever since I started teaching entrepreneurship, I've had to retool myself to learn that stuff. So it's a very, very important middle. Because you know what? You're going to do something great to turn an idea into an enterprise that changes the world. Whether it's in business, government, education, you're going to have to sell. You're going to have to convince some customers or stakeholders to buy your story. And that can only happen if you look for these win-win situations, although it's soundbikes, 1 plus 1 equals 3 type situation. Whether it's partnerships like we talked about earlier between Visio and Microsoft or whether it's just directly selling a product or service. And so this is a list of characteristics of entrepreneurs by a person who wrote a paper called Attest for the Faint Hardiness and the Harvard Business Review. And he studied entrepreneurs all over the globe, which I told you I have a great interest in. And he studied them all and he came up with five attributes. And maybe you've heard some of the other ones before, you know, they're adacious and courageous. And patients, and certainly I talked about adaptive. But I love that the one that he also found that was common to all cultures, low tech, high tech, so for closer. And that's just another way of saying being good at sales. So the last one is the mother load of questions or things that I like to think about. And that is the relationship of entrepreneurship to ethics. You know, I said earlier that it's been a real joy and something that I feel so blessed I've had a chance to hang out here at this place, this time over the last 10 years. And saw the grid, the abject grid just, just grip the place in the last part of the 90s. And then see fear grip the place, you know, starting with 2000, 2001. And now see us come back to sort of steady state. What role that ethics play in entrepreneurship during this period and what shall that happen? It's been a big interest to mine. And I want to get this right. You know, it got ugly. I don't need to look down at it. It got very, very ugly. We had things like Enron happen. And it really did put a damper on the whole idea, okay, all entrepreneurs, promoters, are they all bad? No, bad behavior is just bad period. You know, and first of all, statistically it was a small group of people. But bad behavior is bad period at any time during periods of expansion, recession. And it will be found out. It always is found out. I mean, thanks to, I mean, I'm not an ethics professor. I'm just, I'm just know this in terms of studying entrepreneurial situations and high tech. It usually is found out. It almost always is found out because of transparency. You know, failure is okay. And this is where I love it when we get some people who are trying to share a little bit of wisdom in here. And I don't like to, I'm not going to get up on the stage and, you know, and say, you know, be ethical and so forth. All I'm going to say is failure is okay. I've had plenty of it in my life. And thank God my moral compass for one reason or another. You know, God rest my mom and dad or something was pointing in the right direction. So I didn't take the wrong turn. I said, okay, failure is okay. I know that's not the case in every culture in the world, but at least here it is. And character just matters at the end of the day character matters and reputations matter. And certainly semantic was a huge hit. Slate was a terrible failure. And it was psychologically hard to get over with after having been such a success at semantic. But it certainly taught me that by keeping my moral compass pointing in the right direction, things were going to be okay. So who would you rather be? You know, in Iran and there's their stock price in the 2001 going way up, all built on stills and then can crashing down is now, you know, the legend and lore. Would you be folks that we've gotten a know around here and that we can be very, very proud of whether it's Genentech which came out of Stanford and UCSF technology and is the most admired company in the United States, if not the world, or how about recently Google and Yahoo. We've done, I don't know what their market caps are combined, but it's got to dwarf, you know, most of the other tech companies. And so financially they've done great, but it was never about financial gain for them. Anytime you see Jerry and David speak from Yahoo or Sergey and Larry speak from Google, as never it was about financial gain. It was about changing the world, making meaning, all those kinds of things you hear people in here. I tell you, it's absolutely the case. So with that in mind, I sufficiently went long enough to where you can't ask me any question. We will do a few. But I told you, and I thank you for listening so carefully. But send me an email if you have any thoughts on what I had to say. And there is a version of this talk that sort of in paragraph form that I keep up to date on the website. And also, that's only two pages long. If you're interested in a 400 page version, it's in there. But also I urge you to go to the end corner. So let's do a couple of questions. We got to you 530. We have five more minutes. Just do the Captain Kirk thing, the Star Trek thing where you grab this and for those you are new, you get to be on television if you ask a question. Just grab that and speak in. Terrific. How about over here? Oh, the company in London is doing so well. It's called Swift Fine. And they register valuables so that if you say you're up on an offline or online auction, you'll know whether something was stolen or not. Yeah. Yes, right here. Yes, right here. So what I said, I have a product idea of some of some problems that I can support. How far do I have to develop that idea before I should start shopping around people who might be interested in investing who have to be like so many years away from thinking rather than you? What is shopping mean? Well, I'd like to get investment or to work. I know. I would do it right early on. You know, the thing, you know, and I have a story, this is a quick story. I got to be part of a think tank in the 80s that was funded by Paul Allen. And it was over here on Sand Hill Road. And we had lots of wonderful technologies. Oh my God, we had Java, long before sun was thinking about it. We had some others. And this is right at the dawn in the internet. One of the sad things is that there are, and a number of professors were involved. I just happen to be one of the business professors, mostly technical professors from CS and W.A. The problem was there was a culture there not to show things. You know, not to go out in the valley because I remember one time I said, look, let's go show this product over to Andreessen and Jim Clark who were at Netscape just getting under weight. It was essentially like a baby Java. Now, wait, wait, wait, wait. So most people air on waiting too long. And because they're paranoid that somebody's going to steal it and so forth, it just that rarely happens. It's the other way around missing the window of opportunity, you know, it's going to be a surprise, but you know, sound bite. Okay. So I'd say, you know, in this kind of form, we can talk about offline, but earlier is better. How about back and the right? Yeah, I was wondering, what was the biggest thing you wanted to meet in the split experiences? What, what, what, what, you weren't in the split? Oh God, yes. So, so I said semantic was a big success. I left right after the public offering because I wanted to crank something up again. I got together with the fellow who had invented Vizicow, the very first spreadsheet. And so it was just amazing to get a company going with them. But, you know, what I learned other than it was a number of things. And I mentioned one already. We just spent too much money too fast. And our burn rate got up to be about $700,000. When we weren't really clear when the market was going to take it, we were software company. We weren't building hardware. There's no way a software company should have been up spending $700,000 a month. I was just champion in this one in Israel and UK doing a hundred. And, you know, I'd love to ask the founders of Palm. Did they ever get anywhere near $700,000? So there was the cash flow, you know, stuff that, you know, shame on me once again. And the, you know, there's still a lot of personal issues I learned that, you know, I've tried not to repeat. I haven't run into company since then, but I've tried to share with the CEOs of the companies I'm on the board. Just, just lots of, you know, it's some of the stuff you just learned from experience about how to handle certain situations, how to keep a non-performer on, or maybe not keep them on or rehabilitate them, all that kind of stuff. How about one more? Well, all right. No more? Let me, let me invite you once again. And frankly, any undergraduate, I don't care. Freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, any co-term, because when you're undergraduates, believe me, you grow up. And you'll be a junior and senior before you know it. So this thing called the Mayfield Fellows Program, which is a work study program of many of the courses with us, then a summer job in an intern is 10 years old. It's a, we are such a pleasure to be involved with it. So anybody who's going to eventually be a junior, senior, a co-term, I urge you to come upstairs and join us on the fourth floor, just, just four floors up and meet some of the alumni of the program and talk to us about it this evening. Okay? All right. Let me turn it back over to you. On behalf of the basis of STVP, we'd like to welcome our thank Professor Tom Vires for joining us today. Thanks. Thank you. Thanks for putting that room. Thank you. Thanks, senior. It's a real joy. Please come back next week when I'll be introducing our speaker.
