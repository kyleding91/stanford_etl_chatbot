 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Hello, this is Tina Sealeague, host for the Entrepreneur of Thought Leader and Lecture Series at Stanford School of Engineering. Our next season begins Wednesday, October 12th. As a special treat for our loyal listeners, we invite you to experience an episode of our new podcast series, Stanford Innovation Lab. This series, available on iTunes, SoundCloud, and our Stanford eCorner website, offers you engaging conversations about innovation and entrepreneurship. We hope you enjoy it and subscribe to the rest of the series. Welcome to Stanford Innovation Lab. I'm Tina Seale, professor of the practice in the department of Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University. This podcast is designed to give you a taste of the topics we explore in our classes on innovation and entrepreneurship. Our guest today is Michael Terrell, founder and managing partner at Terrell Leadership Group, which offers executive coaching to companies. He's also the co-author of the Inside Out Effect, which focuses on effective leadership. He has also studied Management Science and Engineering at Stanford, where he was also a mayfield fellow. In this episode of the Stanford Innovation Lab, Michael discusses the challenges and opportunities for effective leadership and startup teams. He shares his thoughts after working with countless groups, his process for diagnosing team dynamics, and examples of how he works through problems with teams. I walked away with many meaningful insights and tips, and expect you well too. So, for those people who haven't known you as long as I have, can you tell our listeners a little bit about what you've done since you graduated from Stanford? Sure. After graduating, I got involved in a research and writing project, actually. Someone unexpectedly had just finished up the mayfield program. And I got invited to work on a book on leadership development, team development, with another professor there in the School of Engineering, Benham Tabrizzi. We wrote a book. It's called The Inside Out Effect. I published it. I started a leadership executive coaching practice shortly thereafter, working with many mayfield fellows in the early days especially, and along the way I've taken up a few staff and coaching positions at the GSB at Stanford. I am so fortunate that I've been the beneficiary of some of your workshops and have been incredible impressed. I'm curious, when you walk into a room with a new team, what's the first thing you're looking for? That's a really great question. It's often somewhat informed by why I've been brought there. So if I'm working with a startup team, a founder, there's some reason that I'm there. Let's say it's their decision making process. And one of the things that I'll clue into really early on, even as I walk into a room, is speaking roles or dialogue roles. Who's speaking? Who's not? Who's got sort of engaged posture and is greeting me versus finishing out emails or is on Slack on their phone or is just sitting there in silence. And I try not to judge those things and anchor to a first, seven second first impression, which by the way the research supports, most first impressions get made in those first few seconds. But just to notice them, to notice them sort of take tabs, take stock of them, and usually see if those things take consistent and play out over the course of the workshop or coaching session that I'm there for, or not, and then I can highlight those things. Have you found a lot of consistency between teams in terms of what are the most typical challenges that people face? There are certainly themes, particularly here in the Valley and in startups, themes around trying to reconcile the desire to go really fast with making quality decisions that stick. Sometimes running into, are we updating our KPIs or our goals every month? And if so, what does that do to our ability to stably run and organize teams and motivate our people? So that's an example of something that comes up a lot. In early stage teams, another theme is depending on the background of founders or the early folks, are we friends? Are we family in some cases? This is my spouse. These past co-workers. And what sort of both benefit and baggage come with those pre-existing relationships? Longstanding positive dynamics. Things we're able to kind of communicate without even saying to one another versus long standing fights that get played out in different ways and shapes. Those are other sorts of things. I could go through a list, but those are something that comes up. It's interesting because when companies get started, they're such a focus on the idea, on the product, on the company. But there's a lot of evidence that the team is actually more important than even the idea. The idea is going to morph and change over time. But the team, the founding team, is hopefully relatively stable and getting that working is such so important. I'm going to play you a little clip from Warren Packard. And he's talking about the fact that teams are more important than ideas. And I'm curious if you agree with his perspective. The tension is between what is more important when starting a venture. Is it the team or is it the idea? And along with the idea, you can say, is that the market is that the opportunity is that the business is at the technology. But team and everything else. And in all my experience at DFJ for 13 years, team, team, team. And my experience with Thus right now, having now run this business for, it depends on how you count. It's all uncertain. But a year plus, it's all about team. And no matter where we go with this business or how successful or unsuccessful we are with this business, this journey is going to be fantastically rewarding because of the people that I'm surrounded by. And the people who join this venture. And like I said, this is a layup because I think a lot of you have had this ingrained in you. As time goes on, the venture does become more about the market, more about the product, more about the defense ability and all those things that come to bear. And you have to really focus on. And you're going to hire more and more people and you'll lose touch with employee number 81. I can't remember who that is. But right now, it's all about team. And it really makes this experience fantastic. But there is always some tension between what should lead the charge. And I would say if you're thinking about starting a company. Think about your team. Think about your team first, especially if you don't have that opportunity in front of you. Or if you have that opportunity in front of you, think about who would be the best folks to join you in that venture. So, Michael, what do you think about that? Well, being a person who does all my work in the team and developmental space, I'm certainly a fan of the core message. And I think there is compelling evidence that suggests I think no more. This may have been shared in some of these earlier conversations. I know you've worked with him as he's visited Stanford, has done research on founders dilemmas. And studying thousands of startups finds that of the early stage startups that fail, 65% of them fail because of team-related people-related issues. Not product market fit, not funding, not some of the things we typically think are so essential as companies get off the ground. So I think there's some research that was substantiate what he's saying in that clip there. And at another point, he highlights there is just how much that early stage team is going to feed you and fulfill you as you get going early on, especially. He seems to be alluding to those first 5, 10, 15 employees and just how meaningful that can be. And particularly if you're somebody who's relationally driven, and we all are to a certain extent, some of us more than others, that can be a huge source of your ROI, particularly in the early days where it's, you know, bagel bites and late nights and blood sweat and tears. It's what's the quality of the person next to me and my sense of closeness and commitment to them. What sort of tools do you use when you're helping to assess how a team's working and then also helping them improve their relationships? So when I come into work with a team, my work usually falls into one of two categories. The first is some sort of process conversation or contracting conversation where we sit down as a group, let's say it's a team of four or five people and we just have an open conversation about what is our process right now? It might be around how we make decisions, how we organize our workflow, how we prioritize our tasks. What is it? Is it explicit? What's working here? What's not? What's working for you? What's not working for you? And we have a chance. It's almost, you know, in its silliest forms, feels like sort of a group therapy session. We're not asking those deep-seated questions, what we're sort of saying, what's going on here and how we do ourselves? And can we, when I call it a contracting conversation, can we make a new explicit contract with one another about how we might want to tweak some things going forward? So that's one way. It's a process contracting conversation. Another way to sort of get there and sort of the second category of interventions I might do with the team when I'm brought into work with them is to do some sort of simulation. So I was talking earlier a little bit about when I walk in and I start noticing sort of what speaking roles might people be in, what sort of non-verbals are people showing up with. What I'll sometimes do is come in and say, let's say there's a decision that the team needs to make or there's a long-standing strategy conversation that's been being put off. I'll have them have that conversation with one another and I'll film it. So I'll record a 20, 30 minute conversation. They'll actually be making some decision or come to some consensus together. And then afterwards, we'll talk a little bit about some of the theory behind team dynamics, things like group biases, things like speaking roles. And then I'll play the film back, projected up on the wall, and have them all take notes on it. They'll take those notes because though they've been being filmed and this is just one conversation, I believe in my experience as shown that that conversation is usually a pretty good proxy for how they tend to show up with one another. And so the learning that they take is they jot down notes there and then get into that conversation about, wow, what did I observe? I didn't even realize that I spoke for half of our allotted time. Sometimes the leader would be like, wow, I took up a lot of space there and I didn't really get as much input as I thought or somebody will notice, wow, a lot of my comments are pretty divergent. Or I'm somebody who always resists the flow of the group. I'm always pushing back. I'm always devil's advocating. And I noticed the group kind of stopped listening to me at some point. They're able to either self-reflect and make those observations or point them out and one another and then get to that new contract with one another as things they want to tweak, going forward or things they want to continue that are working well. Very, very cool. Do you find that there are some very common blind spots that people have or is it very, very individual? There's certainly a large swath. I think one of the things I find particularly in early stage founders is I think it's one I was alluding to a little bit. And I've got counter examples already coming to mind. But sometimes when you have such an affinity and ownership of that first product and you have such a vision for what you want it to be, while you might say, you know what, I do want people's input, I want to have a collaborative team to be sort of unaware of just how much space you take up or just how directive your leadership may be. That's something that I think sometimes surprises people. I think oftentimes when people hear them, if we go to the film example, when they hear themselves on video or they see themselves, it's like if you ever listen to yourself recorded on a phone message or when we listen back to this podcast later, they're like, oh my gosh, that's how I sound. There's sort of this moment where it's like, wow, I am, you know, I let in all my sentences in an uptick or I'm sort of shouting all the time or I sort of look aloof as I present things. I just sure while lead when I cut people off. So there's a large variety within that, but there's a self awareness that people come into by just getting to watch themselves do their thing, which they rarely get to do, because as you know, we don't do our team meetings in front of mirrors. Yeah, it's super interesting to listen to yourself or to watch a video. There are always a bunch of surprises. I know that it always makes me cringe, but I learn something every single time. Now, let's get back to the idea of founders getting together around a passion for an idea. Sometimes though, there are styles. I mean, they might have been great when they were buddies, but all of a sudden now they're working together and their styles, their approach, their philosophies, really different. I'm going to play a clip from Martin Miko's about what happens when founders have a falling out. And I'd love for you to give your reflections on what he's saying. We did have a complete fallout with the CTO and founder of MySQL in later years. This could have derailed the whole company. I was running the business, and I was realizing, or concluding, or thinking, or erroneously thinking, I'll leave that to you to assess, that the founder wasn't being productive anymore. Didn't produce what he was supposed to do, didn't lead the way he was supposed to do, didn't let others lead the way they were supposed to lead. So I removed him from all important roles. We left all kinds of nice job titles, so it looked good, but we essentially stripped him of all responsibility, because it didn't work. And he responded by starting to sabotage my work as a CEO. And managing this conflict between a hired gun, a CEO who came on board, and a founder, is a huge stress for anybody. And I can tell you, it happens in nearly every startup. It's amazing how, or not amazing, it's sad how common it is, that you get conflicts between founders themselves or between founders and the new guys. So this is Martin Miko's who was a CEO of MySQL, and he was brought in as a CEO, and clearly having attention with the original founders. Do you walk into these situations? What do you do? These are the fun ones. Usually having some conversation or walking into this situation would actually be a series of walking into separate conversations. Usually it's going to be a conversation with, in this case, Martin first, potentially a conversation with his counterpart or the original founder, and doing a little bit of triage before, if ever, you get into some sort of mediated conversation of some kind. These conversations are really hard. The startups are passion projects, and beautiful, great monumental things can come from that. Also highly destructive and irreparable dynamics can emerge because of that. And so one of the things I always try to be really realistic with my clients on, if I'm brought in in this sort of high-tension co-founder situation or a new professional executive brought in and having tensions with the founders, just leveling with them that the best outcome might not be some harmonious, beautiful, smooth, everything out outcome. It might actually mean a drastic roll shift. It might mean somebody needing to leave, even leave the company and trying to really get real and level with people about that as potentially an outcome of really stepping into these conversations and to solving this problem. And if they're unwilling to consider that as a potential outcome, then I typically will set that engagement aside and go elsewhere because that just needs to be on the table when it comes to these deep-seated differences. It's really interesting because putting on the table the beginning, the fact that outcomes might not be so beautiful for everybody and that some people might be winners and some might be losers. But it might actually be a big win for the company, even as an individual, might not get exactly what they want. Absolutely. I think people need to be really forced to confront what sort of costs are they willing to take on? What are they willing to tolerate? If the win for them is staying, what might they be willing to give up? And if there are certain things that they aren't willing to give up, we need to explore them not staying as an option. How much do people have to get to know themselves and really do some deep introspection in order to make this all work? Can you be dealing with a team if every individual on the team doesn't have some intelligence about how they really work? I'm presuming most of the listeners are thinking, if you've got a room full of blind people or people who are highly unself-aware, it's a recipe for disaster. And I'm right here to tell you that I'm with you. My experience has been when you encounter a situation where people are unwilling to acknowledge their role in something, the good and the bad that they bring to a situation, then you have a recipe for people just bumping up against each other in really destructive ways. The challenges were rarely taught the skills to do that. And if you think about going back to your time in college or high school or wherever it is you did your education, when was the last class you took on self-knowing or on working well with others? For me it's sort of like I go back to, well maybe it was elementary school which was playing well with Johnny on the playground or something like that. We've got very few examples where we're forced or our education system funnels us towards building these sorts of skills. So they need to be, it usually takes an active effort on somebody's part to go out and pick up a book or work with a coach or have a great mentor who asks them provocative opening the questions to really dig into, who am I? What do I value? What are my habits? What are my strengths and where do I tend to get in trouble? So it's interesting because you might get really good in your role as a great team member. And then when it's happening you get promoted into a leadership role and all of a sudden there are really different set of skills that are required. Do you work with people who end up in roles that are very different and where now they have to actually have and develop a brand new skill set with regard to working with others? Yeah, absolutely. It's the reason I have a job really. Because you have these functionally brilliant people, they're initial product people, they're initial engineers, they struck all the initial deals or marketing contracts for a company and all of a sudden they're managing a team of five people or they're managing a team of three people who are all managers of other people and the skill set really shifts drastically. One of my favorite lines is from a clip that I'm going to play from Josh Reeves who is also a former Mayfield fellow who runs a company called Gusto. He talks about the importance of leaders firing themselves, essentially giving up responsibilities and not feeling like they need to own every aspect of the product or the project. So I'm going to play you this and get your thoughts on how you prepare people to do this. Another topic I get asked a lot about is how does the role of CEO evolve or change? What does it mean to be a CEO? This is a question I asked myself a lot when I was at Intel as well where the CEO of Intel literally had, I think at that point they were 70,000 employees and I wondered how does a person leading a 70,000 person company know how to spend his or her time? You could literally have like an hour free and call ahead of state or call a journalist or hire someone or do all these different tasks. How does that not just overload your synapses? And the answer is in some ways it's all about delegation, right? It's about firing yourself from as many jobs as you can. How do you fire yourself? Well, the funny thing is I know Josh and back to our previous question of having the self-awareness to be effective in teams. I know he brings that in large numbers. And so I think when he's describing really requires a certain amount of self-awareness and self-confidence. Because what happens for most of us is that over time as we become a proficient in something and we get rewarded either within our team, within our company, within our culture for that thing, we identify with it. And so doing what he describes, it's four sentences, easy to say, much harder to do for many of us because what it means is letting go of that thing, that for the last six months or the last six years for some of us has been what we've derived our sense of value and worth from and stepping into a new unknown. And sometimes stepping into things that I'm actually not quite as good at because I've fired myself from the last thing that I've been working on for the past five years, which can be really difficult. You know, it's funny that the clip makes me think of an email I got from a client of mine the other day. And it's a there's a medium post by Henry Ward. He's the CEO at E shares and he wrote a post called a manager's FAQ. And one of the one of the questions he's often asked is how do I decide as a manager what to delegate? And his response was delegate the work that you want to do. And there's there's something in that response that reminds me a bit of what Josh is going for here, which is whatever it is you find yourself wanting to do the interesting work, the stuff that you're maybe really good at. Over time as you grow your company grows, you grow in your role, give that work to other people and let them go do that and take on the kind of gritty, gnarly different challenges that you need to adapt to as the leader of the organization to shift into and let other people do the things that you've grown accustomed to doing. Very interesting. I'm sure that's hard for a lot of people. I'm going to have to go do a little self assessment myself. Makes you feel good. So I'm going to play the rest of this clip from Josh because he goes on to talk about the importance of interviewing people and how you essentially build your team. I spend 50% of my time interviewing people. That kind of might seem crazy to hear that, but that's the way it's been for two years now. That's the way it will be for the next five or ten years. Interviewing is a really important skill. If you guys have any questions you can talk to me after, but the ability to interview I think is something that everyone should build as a skill set. When I was at Zazzle as a first job at a school, I was at PM, but I also volunteered to run all of our Stanford College recruiting. It's just like a muscle you have to iterate and get better at it through practice and interviewing. Again, you can always get better. So interviewing, how to get good at interviewing and what are the key characteristics of a good interview that allows you to really assess who that person is and whether they'll be a good fit for your team? I love this question. I wish Josh was here to give you the entire playbook because I know he's a great expert at this. I think what I often find myself talking to folks about when they're curious about how to get better at interviewing is first off getting really clear on what their objectives are. Is it that we're hiring for a product lead on our mobile platform? Great. What else is important about that person? What sort of team are they walking into? How are you going to assess whether or not they fit with your values and with your culture? That begs questions. Sometimes I'm sitting out with somebody for the first time. How would you describe your culture? It gets to these more macro questions. That's not just does somebody have the technical brilliance or the functional expertise to do what I need them to do, but how are they going to fit into this constellation of people? What I often end up helping people do is really think about what are those compelling, deep, revealing, open-ended questions that they could bring to an interview scenario that are going to help them get a sense for how might this person actually show up day to day? Because as much as we'd love to have a trial period where we have three to six months with everybody and can test drive them before we hire them, but as we know that's usually not the case. It often comes to, I help people augment their interviewing skillset by asking or adding questions like, tell me about the last time you felt really invigorated by your work. Then getting curious about that. What was it about that that really let you up? Oh, it sounds like being able to go off for a day and just brain dump was an important part of that. What else? Ask questions that people can't just answer with a yes or a no, but they're forced to describe the contours and the colors of what their experience has been. Also to be really specific about the behavioral elements of it, I might ask something like, or help people get to the point of asking something like, tell me about the last time you really butt heads with a manager or felt really demotivated by something. What happened? What did that person do? Really interesting. I know that one of the challenges today is that people don't often work in the same space. We have a lot of distributed teams. Even though you might hire someone who might be great if they were sitting across the desk from you, but they might be sitting across the world from you, and there are really different skills that are needed if you're going to collaborate across long distances. I'm going to play you a clip from Jocelyn Goldfine who was at Facebook, and she's talking about how distributed teams fit into their culture and the challenges that they result in. There is no software of significance ever that has been built by a single person acting alone. Facebook itself, Mark and listed his roommates within a week. This is one of the areas in which college will kind of mislead you actually because you're taking a lot of the ACS classes where it's actually cheating to get help from somebody else, and then in real life what we expect you to do is get help from other people. It's really hard to collaborate with someone who you can't look in the eye to resolve a dispute or a miscommunication, and it is really, really hard to communicate with someone who is in a distant time zone from you where you're overlapping hours of awakeness are not that many. So how do you do that? Do you work with teams that are distributed around the world and help them solve issues that are really complicated by the fact that they're not in the same room? Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Everything that she said really resonates with the experience I have working with distributed teams. I've got clients who've got offices here in San Francisco, in London, in Germany, in France. I work with a company whose the majority of their team is distributed. So in the world we live in today it's incredibly common to be dealing across time zones and across cultures. And I would say from the experience I've had the point she raises are spot on, overlapping windows of awakeness and the challenges those present. Being unable to look somebody in the eye when you have a dispute, a conflict, a debate, there's a ton of compelling research around what percentage of our communication has actually done nonverbaly. In different studies say different things. Some are, yeah, team is making faces at me right now, everyone. Is anywhere from, I don't know, 40 to say 60% different studies say different things, but a significant amount of it comes through our nonverbals, through our posture, through our fitness. So what do you do with this? I mean, how do you help teams solve these problems when they don't have all the nonverbal cues? Yeah, it's a, it's a, it's really hard. It's really hard. I think one of the things that you just have to double down on if you're a team in that situation is what are our communication processes? And you have to be more rigorous about them because you can't get away with, hey, let me turn four desks over and ask you a quick question thing or, hey, let me run into you in the cafeteria during a break or during lunch to clarify this and you can't rely on that. So you just have to have clearer expectations around communication mechanisms. Okay, what is, we have a distributed team. What is our all hands or team stand up going to look like? And can we do that in a format that works for everyone? This is sort of a simple thing to say, but surprising to me how many teams grapple with it, which is what's our technology set up to actually have clear, crisp, audible, non-laggy communication as we have three different offices or people in three different locations, you know, all videoing into the same meeting. Yeah, I can imagine that people in remote locations can often feel left out of a decision, right? You're having an informal conversation with the person who's in my office and all of a sudden the person around the world realizes, hey, who made that decision? Oh, yeah, we were walking down the hall and we resolved that issue, right? And for people to feel left out and absolutely. And I mean, you're highlighting right now when you have uneven distribution of people. So let's say, you know, 80% of your offices in person in San Francisco, but you do have satellite offices, sort of like what she was describing. When I bring a mindfulness or an awareness to the effect these little momentary interactions have on that person sitting halfway around the world and can we have some system for keeping them in the loop or for getting their input? It's really, really important. What processes can people put in place to mitigate these situations? I think a lot of it boils down to really being intentional about the how. What I mean by that is particularly in startups, so much time and energy goes into the what, the what are we doing today? What do we need to get done? What's important? What's top of the list? Maybe if we're lucky, we have the why and that vision behind it. But when it comes to successful teams, whether they're distributed like the ones we were just talking about or ones that all sit around the same office, is are we pausing every so often to ask ourselves, so how are we going about this, everyone? How are we doing ourselves? What sorts of ways are we communicating? How do we coordinate tasks? How do we listen to one another? How do we exchange feedback when things aren't going well? How do we exchange feedback when things are going really well? One of the things when it comes to team and making teams work that can be tempting is to talk about where teams go bad and the problems and challenges that can arise. I think an equally important thing, in fact the research would show that it has disproportionate positive effects is if you can really build a culture of appreciation of recognition that has, that will equip a team to survive the, the squals and the hard times that inevitably come with a course of building something from nothing. So I guess my answer would be to focus on the how. Great. Isn't usually the case that everyone in team knows when it's not working or is it a few people in the team who are going, oh my gosh this is really broken and some of the people on the team think it's working just fine. In a high functioning team, a team knows when things aren't going well. But that's the ideal. Most often you have a distributed sense of how well things are going or not. And the pain is usually most acutely felt by a certain number of people around the table. Regardless of which of those categories your team falls into though, the question I often have for the people I work with is how are you creating the conditions for whether it's just one person or a disproportionate number of people who are feeling natively? How are you creating the conditions for that to actually have the light of day for people to name that elephant in the room and be able to speak about it? Because so often those things get swept under the rug or they're done inside conversations or in grumbles to our significant other when we go home from work. It seems to me that every team should almost have a safe word when things aren't working. It's like, you know, purple elephant, purple elephant or something that like, okay, let's take a break and see if we're doing things. I have worked with teams who incorporate things like that. They'll have a totem or an action figure that they share around in a meeting and they'll assign the role of a facilitator. And that person's role is to keep people on topic, keep them on time, and to flag in a parking lot any sort of issue that seems like it's sort of present but not being addressed to be revisited next time. So absolutely. It's wacky. Some of these team things are like, why do we have to talk about that? But we need to make those implicit things, those things that are happening in our head a little bit more explicit more often because for most of us, we are on the side of censoring them and letting them fester. So if people were listening, wanting to do something today or tomorrow to improve their effectiveness on the teams are working on, is there one thing they could do that really would be meaningful? Yeah, I think I'll go back to that comment I had about actually recognizing the positive. Obviously, there's lots that could be done around how can we improve and get better. There are auxiliary skills around people managing their defensiveness. We can get into a sticky wicket when we go to how do we get better, how do we improve, and we start exchanging constructive feedback. So let me leave you with something a little simpler. And that is, imagine you have a team meeting next week and you want to figure out how to improve as a team incrementally. If you're the leader or you're just somebody on that team, send out an email a few days before that poses the question, what's something that everybody on this team does that really works for you, that you not only love to see them continue, but do even more of. Have people prepare their answer to that question and start your next meeting by setting a side 15 or 20 minutes to have everyone go around and share that thing for the other several people around the room. I had noticed you tend to do this. It really has a positive impact on me and what I'm trying to accomplish. Please do more of it. Well, Michael, I noticed that you were incredibly responsive to all the questions I asked. Thank you very, very much for this really wonderful interview. You're welcome. I'm glad I was.
