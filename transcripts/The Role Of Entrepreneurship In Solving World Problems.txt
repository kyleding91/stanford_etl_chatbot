 You are listening to the Draper Fisher-Jurvinson entrepreneurial thought leader seminar brought to you weekly by Stanford Technology Ventures program at Stanford University School of Engineering. Let me welcome a very special guest to to kick us off and that is the president of our University John Hennessey. Welcome John. Well I don't want to take a lot of time because the true genius today are the members of this panel and so I want to make sure we leave them enough time. But when I think about what makes a great entrepreneur I think about four things. First of all a vision, a vision of seeing to an angle, of seeing an opportunity to make a change. Secondly the ability to stay focused on that goal. Lots of small companies to fail fail because they can't stay focused. Lots of people who fail and their research endeavors fail because they can't stay focused. Third thinking outside the box, finding innovative solutions to problems. And fourth seeing the endeavor through, seeing not only the discovery in the lab but seeing that discovery go outside the walls of the research laboratory and go out and have the impact it can really have in the world. This afternoon we're going to hear about how to apply these kinds of ideas, this kind of entrepreneurial thinking to the area of global problems. The kinds of problems that are often not approached in an entrepreneurial way. They're approached with big bureaucracies and lots of people rather than thinking about new solutions and new approaches. We've got a distinguished panel I think that's going to help us think about that and think in a different way really using the kind of pioneering spirit that entrepreneurship really embraces. So let me turn it back to Tom so he can introduce our panel and we can get started. Thank you John. Thank you very much. First of all I'm introduced Kavita and then ask her to move to the other end of the so this Kavita Ramdas welcome her please. And I'll follow her down here to her partner today and international issues will be Chip Blacker welcome Chip please. In the center we have a couple of wonderful people and talk to us about energy and environment issues K.R. Shweed are a bloom energy. How was parking? You were okay with parking? We figured we would if we didn't solve all the world's problems today we'd figure out maybe some parking solutions. No I know it's just Stanford's gender bias. It's already started. It's already started. Okay and Jen Jeff Kossop from our university here. Paul Yock from the School of Medicine and the School of Engineering frankly. And somebody I've been sharing DNA with for a long time my brother Brooke buyers. So John Hennessey said it really well he actually took the words out of my mouth so let me tell you a little bit about the format. I hope this to create a dinner conversation. We don't have any food we've got some water but we've invited you over to hang out with us a couple hundred people you know here live and a few thousand more on the podcast and video cast and that's really what I want is a dinner conversation because we have three distinct fields here and human health and energy and environment and international issues. Another word like when I talked to my great nephew and he says oh my gosh if bird flu doesn't kill me. Oh so Katrina likes her key is going to kill me and that doesn't kill me some 9-11 attacks going to kill me. Is that is that all we is that all we got is that all we got to look forward to and obviously as entrepreneurs we feel differently. Now each one of these areas is so deep as you all know and has so many things going on around it you can't even open a campus newspaper or even a national newspaper or any kind of news and here not here about something very cool going on in each one of these areas. I mean just today the school of medicine just got a big grant for the stem cell building here and I could go on on there's an energy conference energy crossroads starting tomorrow night including Tom Freeman on Friday so we realize that and that's that's so that's a lot to chew off you know bite and chew on for an hour together so what I'm trying to do is and I think we we have is a unique collection of people who care a great deal about how launch ownership and innovation is going to play in those fields and then we're going to and what we're going to try to do is you know kick off with it each area and get you know frame it and understand the issues and then start looking at some particular solutions and then get a dinner conversation going amongst them because it's very interesting when people from one discipline start to think about what's going on another and I don't know if that's been pulled off or here yet lately we each have so many things going on in each of the areas that it's it's worth a try so we're all going to do some questions and answers about halfway through I'm going to ask you to raise your hand if you want to write down a question on an index card our wonderful ushers will bring an index card and we'll gather them up and do some semi you know structured Q&A for the last part of this I let me say this now so I don't forget later in all the excitement but as we finish up around six o'clock you are all welcome to go across the courtyard or you know over to the other atrium at the Packard Building and join us for a showcase of all kinds of cool technologies and science going on in Stanford labs this is sponsored by the Office of Technology Licensing so that that's going to take place with a full reception at six o'clock so you'll get a chance to meet hopefully some of the panelists will come over and join us as well all right so with that in mind let me let me start with my brother and Paul let's do that wonder I'd like you guys to introduce yourself just a little bit to give us some context I know they have your bios but why is it that you have at this stage of your career with all that you've accomplished why is it you care so much about the field that I've asked you to come chat about today in this case human health absolutely okay I'll go ahead and following the dinner analogy I'm gonna set the table a bit and probably talk through the entire appetizer hope you don't mind if I go through that first let me say I am thrilled to be here for a variety of reasons first is to be sitting with the the teaching award winning Tom buyers who won the Gores teaching award last year this is not bios or to be back at Stanford where I was educated to be with my heroes John Hennesseen and Paul Yacht and to discuss the three themes of this panel and as I was thinking about this panel this to me is so typical of Stanford's expertise because what may seem like three independent topics actually in my mind all interrelate on a global stage an example climate change will affect the habitat of insects and animals which can affect disease vectors that also affect food and water supply which will affect forced migration war and poverty and all these in my mind then go together I'm gonna focus my comments then on what I understand which is the health care field but I think why is entrepreneurship relevant to these huge things I just went through entrepreneurship as John pointed out is a way of thinking it's a way of thinking about solving problems in a non structured way not hierarchical cutting across disciplines seeing the big picture as well and daring to be great with big ideas so environmental science meets international public policy meets advocacy meets health care meets energy meets delivery systems so the solutions to these problems require public private partnerships between the private sector industry universities and governments and I frankly tire of the debate about should those be involved together should they work together and all of that they have to these problems we're talking about is so important and they're imminent I mean they're honest they're already happening and we need more of that because so much is at stake and now it's all about really in my mind innovation and Tom asked me to talk about a couple of hot areas in health care the common thread of the three areas I'm gonna talk about is that is really early detection early response and these are breakthrough areas that are happening in implementing science into medicine not only in rich developed countries but they can be applied to developing countries and countries that can't for good health care as well we've run the experiment on medicine and growing the medical system and spending and the experiment has failed we're spending 1.7 trillion a year 1.9 trillion dollars a year in this country alone and that's expected to double by 2016 that is and the proportion of GDP here would be 25% imagine what that is in a less developed country and one of the prime drivers is the aging of the population and the health care issues that go with that and so we're all in this together and the thing about health care and disease and caring for health is that there are no boundaries there are no country borders we're all we're all really in this together and we all share the same problem which is we develop drugs in an old-fashioned way which have unforeseen side effects most drugs only work on half the people who take them it's kind of a blind shot we have mutations running ahead of vaccines and antivirals so what do we do about all this so the first is innovation in infectious disease there was very little innovation for about 20 years in vaccines antivirals and rapid diagnostics that is just starting to change so there's a good news and hope on that avian flu if it does nothing else is wake up our need for innovation around vaccines up to this date vaccines have been made in eggs and you've already about the drawbacks of that they need to be made in self-urgentation systems for rapid turnaround now we're going from eggs which takes about then all together about six seven months to go from identification is trained to vaccine supply and cells it could be in three months that's still not good enough we need innovation then in universal vaccines which is biology molecular biology parasitology we need innovation in manufacturing techniques mechanical engineering flow engineering all of that and then in delivery systems are getting all this out to the people who need it which gets into public policy and maybe we'll come back to that is this a big problem I mean you don't hear much about avian flu anymore well there actually people dying of h five and one avian flu around the world it's not in the headlines because other things in the headlines like aninacol smith why why is that in the headlines and not what we're talking about or the need for rapid-pointed care diagnostic and the good news on that people are working on that but right now you cannot take a throat swab and determine to someone have regular flu or avian by the way half a million people around the world die each year of what we call regular flu second is innovation and diagnostics with patients for patients with disease right now doctors and patients make a pretty rough estimate of what to do about a patient with disease and the change going on there is the liquid disease at a molecular level and this is applying the new techniques of real-time PCR and gene chips so that it is just becoming available now that a doctor can sit with a patient take a sample run the test and actually know the right drug and the right dose for that person will they be a responder or not or will they have an adverse event think about how much that will save in running the clinical trials and developing drugs right through drugs but also how much where all that savings could go in the health care system because if only about half the drugs people take are the efficacious for that person and you could run a clinical trial that's much more tailored the whole thing the whole system can be sped up and done much more efficiently there a good example of that is a test called archetype DX for women with breast cancer it now it's been run on 22,000 women now and it can predict recurrence and also tell if that patient will be a responder or not to chemo whether they should actually have chemo and to give you an example of statistics 90% of women with breast cancer ER positive no negative that's estrogen receptor positive get chemo only 4% will benefit and until recently that was not able to be told and then my final one I want to give as an example is may not seem applicable to the entire world but I think it is as it's developed and as it comes down to learning curve of cost and that is consumer genomics a topic that's in the news today and something that there's concern about privacy of course and all of that but the ability to analyze genetic differences for an individual it can be done with a simple solider test sample that is not a simple test it's a whole genome assay the cost of doing that is down to hundreds of dollars now and will continue to come down now why is that important is that I think we're going to see in the next five years is moving health care to the individual and this is what's been lost in the health care system and this is why there's so much inefficiency and if we move the responsibility health care to the individual when they know what their predispositions are and that are actionable by them I'm optimistic that something good it can come of that too supporting you have any reactions that and then I want to open it up and then we'll we'll stay on the health care issue just a brief point I want to pick up from book that that was beautifully laid out you know by way background for me I'm on a different end of the spectrum and broke books kind of a biotech and I am a gizmologist sort of the in-and-the-yawk of the health care experience here but so I've spent my career helping to develop and test really expensive high-end medical technologies and and one of the things specifically that that I've woken up to just in the last couple of years is the point you made about the fact that that we are headed for four trillion dollars of health care expenditures and the economists all say that the major driver of the increase in health care costs is new technology development so I'm looking at that and thinking and and I propose our dinner conversation so we have an interesting opportunity I think on the international front and and it goes something like this I think I have a rough idea about this so so we are exporting a pandemic right now which I call the trans-fab pandemic right I mean we are exporting to the world cardiovascular disease which will become the greatest killer in the world our technologies are very high-end very complicated we have a chance as India and China develop these the their approaches to do it with a completely different mind frame a mind frame of cost appropriate very good technologies and we are as a program at Sanford we're going to invest heavy hours man time and money into looking at how those technologies get reinvented in a global setting and part of our logic is that we've got to do that here we've got to develop technologies that are more cost appropriate and maybe the way to do that is to look at an international perspective bring it back to us do you have a comment on that Kavita or chip I'm not sure that I'm not sure that it's a comment specifically on this but I when I was thinking about the three big challenges as I see it from the perspective of what we're facing globally my first major challenge is what I see as the complete unsustainability of our current way of living and our patterns of consumption and particularly how we live in rich countries and how the rich live in poor countries and I think that that is a very deeply related issue to this question of you know if you're talking about healthcare and you're failing to understand that what we describe as good health is as much an outcome of the ways in which we think it is appropriate to live then we are sort of starting at the wrong end we are starting as a doctor would say from a symptomatic relief of the problem and rather ignoring what are sort of the root causes of that problem and I would argue that this this is the dominant paradigm that we have right now in the world it's a completely unsustainable paradigm it's deeply rooted in our current economic system the assumption that global capitalism as it currently exists is the answer to all of us problems and that massive amounts of consumption both at the physical level of taking in vastly unnecessary quantities of calories to the to the sort of gross level of consuming vast amounts of material products they are very much related to the same understanding and I think you know there are many people on this panel who are much better suited to look at this whole question of these inequalities but I think what's important is that it isn't just a current problem it's the beginnings of a future problem because it's the dominant paradigm for places in the so-called developing world it's the paradigm that we are all aspiring to you know hoping to soon become the same overweight obese in you know and inactive populations that we see as being demonstrative or emblematic of having arrived sitting in our big cars going to eat the meal that you're talking about we probably don't need appetizer. Dal and rice is you know Dal and rice is good enough and it's actually been probably a lot healthier for most parts of the world so I just I put that out there as I think one way to think about this question of hell. Jeff well I just cancelled my order I'm just going to have water to. I just want to raise it at building a point that Kavita made and raise another issue about the human health care challenge I think that we we face and it's and it's and it's related to the environment. I'm the last one sitting here being a victim of cardiovascular disease to not clinical medicine and the value of clinical medicine I have a stent in me and I think I think it every morning for the quality of life that I have now but I think when you're talking about perhaps that you know go out of the United States there are two billion people in the world that do not have clean water to drink maybe a billion a billion. The two billion people who do not have adequate sanitation and so when you're looking at health problems and fundamental trying to deal with with the health of people I think you have to start with with those two issues the quality of the water we drink and the kind of sanitation that is available and until we solve those problems then I think it's going to be very very difficult to really get a handle on on the health care issue globally and internationally and until we do it I suspect we're going to have a lot of the kinds of problems that Chip will talk about to deal with so Brooke is absolutely correct these problems are all interrelated but I don't think you know in looking at human health care we should ignore what the the environmental aspect and and the part about just simple provision of clean water and sanitation I think the challenge yeah if you answer always the challenge I mean you've been kind of provide water to drink and sanitation for for years and years and years is simply this that the places where they don't have clean water to drink or they don't have adequate sanitation they simply don't have the infrastructure or the means of providing that infrastructure so if you're thinking about a challenge that you'd like to solve how about that you know coming up with water supply and and sanitation systems that can be delivered on a on a village like scale that can be completely autonomous they can work on say membrane reactor technology and that are culturally socially anthropologically acceptable to the people that are going to use them because if we don't deal with those issues simultaneously a technology that is not being used effectively is a technology that's not being deployed effectively and it's not a solution and I think we need to look at those kinds of issues altogether really get our chip yeah just a point that emphasizes Brooks comment about interrelatedness the point that Jeff just made if you're primarily focused on political structure and politics it's a condemnation of many of our existing political entities and governance structures I mean it's a catastrophic failure on part of social organization in order to deliver some of these these basic necessities of life so in fact you know whether we all aspire to be fat and immobile and rich or not I think for the bottom billion at least or the bottom two billion there are some issues that need to be addressed straight up that have to do less with technology or technological innovation and have to do with capacities for self-government I mean it's a huge huge issue and I mean it has been for a long time but it's front and center now because of the phenomenon of failing in failed states which is a foreign policy preoccupation so let me take the approach that I took to parting which was very counter to what others may have done to how I think about it and it's going to be counter to what you heard so far I said probably everybody's gonna look for the closest parting as they enter into the campus and circle around to find who's moving out and this building is deep inside I'm gonna drive us closest I can because most people probably won't have the passions and will think that very close to campus they won't find a part right outside the closest part of the open I took it I walked that that's entrepreneurship from from my problem so I'm gonna sit here and say if I'm able to have an appetizer of main course and a dessert and I'm able to do that in such a way that it can be sustainable and I can also provide an opportunity for everybody else in the world to be able to do that I was allowed to eat all three meals without feeling any guilt as long as I can be okay so the approach to energy is the following in Biscoe again if you guys think about it you'll be taught about vitamins and pain killers okay vitamins are nice to have but if you're going to write a business plan think about pain killers because that's really the pain points you know if you do something then it's going to appear well when it comes to sustainable entrepreneurship so I'm gonna take a way from entrepreneurship to sustainable entrepreneurship when it comes to sustainable entrepreneurship I would say don't listen to that BS because it's not vitamins it is not pain killers because the pain killer masks the pain it does not cure the pain going back to you know going back to Tavitas problem get into the root parts and here what you have is you're being told again if you go into you know thermodynamics 101 science 101 you're told energy is the capacity to do work so if you believe that work is what creates economic growth and job and opportunities if you think that your generation in the next generation should be better off than our generation just logic tells you that you need more energy to go okay think about it you need more energy to go so now you have not a pain but if you continue the way you continue you got a pandemic out there let me take that example there are parts per trillion of those things that you can breathe from the air that if you breathe is going to cause a problem and most of the world is telling you know skip every other breath so okay you know the probability of you inhaling that one bad germ out there goes down and you may extend your life I'm saying heck no find the cure to this so you can be breathing and feeling good about it in just about three months the sun puts in enough energy in terms of radiation if you're able to capture it I'm not saying we can that equals all of fossil energy that we have ever had on this planet so energy is not a zero-sum game you don't have to feel guilty about using it the opportunity is finding the way to harness it an sustainable man so so I look at you the younger generation and say I envy you and you have to look at us who used in it the fossil energy in a stupid way that it's your generation and not your next generation that has this opportunity to create a huge four trillion dollar market so feel really good about it go after it find the solutions with such a this talk of energy for a little bit let's run with that there's so much buzz on this campus you can you can you can just feel it about green tech and the woods Institute there's a no new building well probably while you were parking you walk by this and building being put up in record time even faster than the stadium was put up to house the woods Institute which has got to be the greatest name of an environmental center ever in history of universities but Jeff and Buzz have done an amazing job in leading that effort on this campus and I I know we match or our peer schools are feeling the same way so there's lots activity in university level so the university's ramping up it just feels like DARPA and you know all that wonderful stuff that happened in semiconductor is in the internet of 20 30 years ago okay so we're we're on our way and then there's people like UK are you leave Arizona at a comfy job you know as a professor to go be an entrepreneur is it is it is it prime time is it ready for there to be a Google ready there for there to be a Microsoft or Intel of energy absolutely so again it is you know timing okay it is timing it is need it is market it's politics it's environment so you know I think I was on this campus talking to Charlie Rose where I said energy really is not a one-trick pony you know somebody tomorrow came up with this magic one and took away all the CO2 issues energy is still an issue there are two billion people there are chairs coming out of object poverty to lower middle class they need energy we don't have we can't drill our way out of this problem we can't smoke our way out of this problem okay we need we need solutions and since Edison there's not been a good idea in electricity it's about time okay it's it's about time so it it is about and also energy today because it is so scarce is the cost of electricity has gone up it's pure supply demand when that starts diverging the cost goes up suddenly for every business no matter why that's a single large cost in you know next to labor cost when that happens you start looking into how much energy are you consuming and what are you paying and why and the inefficiencies in this whole energy generation process and distribution process are so bad that one looks at it and says even if I started with fossil fuel why am I consuming only eight percent of the total calories as photons with which with which I can read when that light comes from where I burn the fuel what's wrong with that picture it's all about efficiency it's not about conservation it's about efficiency we don't waste but we should consume Jeff what do you think and what do you think about what's going to take to turn these ideas being generated the Stanford's into action well I fundamentally agree with with with with K.O. and I and I think if I were to make a point that it would be the following and I think a lot of people come at the energy issue from you know there might be three different ways in which you sort of come to this point and I think the students and some of them are here putting on this energy crossroads meeting realized this and so they they looked at it that people we care about energy because we care about CO2 emissions we care about global warming we some people care about energy they don't really care about CO2 but they care about security or energy security so they're worried about having a secure supply because it has clearly international strategic overtones and political overtones and some people care purely about economic growth so whether you come at energy from global warming or from energy security national security or from economic growth point of view we sort of arrived at the same point in space now and that is we agree that has K.O. appointed out that what we've done in the past is not going to work anymore and we need new solutions now I have a huge respect for technology and I think a lot of the solutions will be in technology but I think you put your finger on the right word and that is efficiency and at least in the next five to fifteen years I think the way we're going to get our handle around the CO2 problem and certainly around the the the national security problem and at the same time create incredible opportunities for economic growth is through efficiency and that means using energy in a smarter way you can think a lot of the technologies that we're going to need are already being developed are they deployed in the right way are we do we have access to the information we need you know in space and time in such a way that we can make the best use of the energy we had can we find ways to take the peak demand curves and shape those peaks off so that in California on a hot summer's day instead of the dirty coal power plants that are sitting somewhere outside of California that are being turned on to provide that peak power that peak power is instead coming from all the electric vehicles that are parked outside the building that are plugged into the building and providing that peak power those are the kinds of things that we need to start doing and a lot of the technology I think exists a lot of it will need to be developed that's how we take that technology and how we deploy it is really going to be important and that comes to the the last point I want to make and that the energy question is fundamentally a human behavior question as well and until we really fundamentally understand how humans make choices and why they make choices and how we can influence those choices so we can make the right choices which is a lot of what efficiency is and it's not about freezing in the dark it's about having a good life but doing it in a way that smart I think until we really get our hands around that and spend time looking at that then we're not going to get the full the full solution that that we really need and I think that's an important thing. Well you can't say energy without talking about politics and the world so on so I'd like you to weigh in on these comments because again we're searching for the role we don't like we said I said at beginning we have a lot we could talk about in each area but I'm trying to say see if we agree that entrepreneurship and innovation has a role in each one of these areas then how are they the same or not but let me make sure to give the inter the global folks such a chance here. I mean I guess I I think we've raised some interesting issues here I think given the changing nature of both economic organization and technology and I think we've been we've been talking about ways in which that has changed which is most clearly I believe seen in that term globalization and you know when we when we see it I mean when we think about it it means you know 20 years ago or 30 years ago the kind of outsourcing that we now talk about it's not only possible because you know the world is a smaller place it's actually possible because of certain kinds of technologies that's what makes that possible. Capital can move in certain ways because of changes in technologies products can be developed in one place and brought to another place because of certain technologies right we had a whole set of things that couldn't happen and in fact people can move because of certain technologies that when you had to take a boat across the ocean it was a whole different story. So clearly I think that's a that's a huge issue I think one of the questions that we will have to grapple with regardless of how entrepreneurial our technological solutions are for creating new sources of energy and I believe with Kiar that there are and I'm looking like he is to all of you for lots of interesting ideas I guess there are two pieces that it raises for me one is that because of this new globalization the inequality is that economic growth and political particular political systems created that formally could be resolved within the context of the nation state so within a country within a particular you know set of boundaries and the imbalances in power not just the inequalities that we spoke of but the imbalances in power which also have to do with self-image with dignity you know with a whole set of things that are not just about whether you're living on two dollars a day you might be living on three hundred and eighty dollars a day and you may still have issues with how you are perceived and the imbalance of power in your society whereas I think maybe even twenty years ago those imbalances and inequalities could be resolved within the context of states today in part because of technology those inequalities just like disease have no national boundaries so they are being those conflicts are now being played out on a global scale which means we do have the repercussions of increased inequalities in China and India and other places don't just have repercussions for those societies they have profound repercussions for us the impact of NAFTA on poor farmers in Mexico is deeply related to the whole immigration question that we had you know in in in droves talking about that last year so those things are not unrelated to each other so I mean I think greater equality can't just be a single goal of one country greater equality and sufficient resources for creation of new energy or new technology by definition in the world that we live in today must be must be done across countries must be done in a way so that the US for example should be putting into Paul putting into place today policies that will enable it to be a happy country amongst other countries even if it isn't the dominant super power that it is today and those are the policies we need to be thinking about for the future to two comments one on energy and one on globalization certainly the role of technology in increasing levels of efficiency is important is quite central to the process but there's a huge public policy dimension to this as well if you're Tom Friedman then you think you know the most effective single act with respect to energy policy that the government could take would be to double or triple taxes on each gallon of gas so that you drive down consumption you know energy is still relatively inexpensive in this country which is why we're so wasteful we have a pretty good set of tax incentives in place in order to encourage people to do these things but it's a huge public policy issue right and I think it's some combination of technological innovation and the political will to bear the costs associated with downsizing our appetites for fossil fuels or you know whatever it is that's traditionally how you shape policy outcomes you know the free market is a wonderful place except when it results in in you know income disparities that are greater in the United States than they have been since 1928 then I then I would suggest we need some adjustment to taxable that's why I'm a Democrat not Republican no it's true the point about the point about globalization that that I would make that the point that Kavita made about the kind of transformational effects of technology my cut at it is a little bit different although not contradictory before the development of mass communications and the internet and the capacity to and to spread this stuff instantaneously many regimes around the world were able to hold the line against change pretend to the outside world that these vast disparities and income and privilege and access did not exist the extreme example of this if you will is the DPRK the Democratic people's Republic of Korea where most of its population believes that the two most powerful countries in the world are the DPRK and the United States of America literally most powerful because there's one radio station in the in the DPRK and all the radios that are sold can tune in one station right and that one station tells them that you know the DPRK is locked in this battle of wills with you know the US it reminds me of the scene out of the film the King and I that was made in the 1950s the map that the King's children looked at the map of the world remember CYAM was like two thirds the size of Asia well it's no longer possible to do that which is a great thing because it connects people around the world it creates solidarity around a whole set of issues that were impossible before but man does it exacerbate the sense of social economic and political deprivation on the part of those who have been systematically oppressed by their own regimes so it's very much a two-edged sword and again for me because this is what I think about it's a huge governance challenge again right because international institutions are in no sense equipped to deal with this these are 1945 models this is like driving a 1945 Sherbert what well actually a 1945 Cadillac because people are very very well taken care of it places like the United Nations well that's that that's great except it's completely inappropriate for the world we live in today yet they're very very difficult to change because the stakeholders are sovereign states and if you can tell me how we talk the French into giving up their permanent veto in the UN Security Council as an example I'm picking on the French I could have said the UK where it might have been appropriate in 1945 it is clearly not appropriate in 2007 I said this one time at a public lecture in Latvia and the French ambassador was there and he literally stood up and started arguing with me about the importance of of French preservation of the of the unit veto at the UN Security Council so if you can tell me how we can talk the French or the British into surrendering their veto power at the UN Security Council and you know we're on the road to salvation and national organization that park it or you can't hear it and I have a quick announcement to make there's an extreme important for policy in all these debates with its healthcare or energy but in addition to that let me emphasize from an entrepreneurial perspective against sustainable entrepreneur in an open-air perspective which is what most of you are here to hear about is for me I'm neither a Democrat nor a Republican I'm a capitalist entrepreneur who believes that you can do good and make good okay and I see technology as a equalizer the reason I see technology as a equalizer let me give you an example when we had when we needed massive infrastructure for telecommunications in the developing world India China even in a city like Mumbai you you you you move into a flat you put in your application for a landline phone seven years later somebody may knock at your door saying I have a phone for you maybe maybe and then you let it pay him something to get something you have cell phones a infrastructure less communication device that does not lead that solid infrastructure I mean it does have infrastructure but not at the levels that you need for landline phones as you walk out of the airport you can pick up a phone but that's not important what's important is what Muhammad Yunus was able to do that in the poorest with the poorest of the poor in Bangladesh he created entrepreneurs of people and increase their life with this with this technology equalizer okay so access is what empowers people the two billion people the reason they are where they are the reason they don't drink the good water is they don't have access to clean energy clean electricity if you give me clean electricity anywhere in the world I'll give you a clean water it's a good one okay so if we're able to and the beauty here again is these multiple forces coming from various places coming into the exact same place in the process of figuring out the most efficient ways to generate electricity you cannot go into transmission and distribution you have to generate it where it's needed so there is no central power that controls who gets power and who doesn't can't make one one one one comment on that because as you were saying that I thought yeah you have the potential to deliver clean water if you have the electricity but if the incentive structure is such in a corrupt system I'm gonna sell that someplace else this is why it's a public yeah it's a public policy issue let me just walk you through again the entrepreneurial thinking I'm asking for is I don't want a PG&E telling me if I if I'm not on their land line if I'm not on the grid I'm out of luck out of grid out of luck I don't want that system I have a box that box is going to generate electricity for me if I can afford to pay it borrow it land it whatever I'll be able to use it if I'm a small fishing village in Bangladesh I'll use the same model I used for the cell phone I cannot afford a cell phone but there's a cell phone lady I go pay her and I go use that system that's the most profitable telecom company so I have a box that box generates electricity if I want clean water I can buy it from that lady that lady gets a loan from a micro landing organization forget the bureaucracy you need someone to enforce property rights absolutely every human wants to enforce property rights if that has any market for it there there will be people who seek to exploit that for their own purposes that's what will happen your generation is going to create that because every human being is an entrepreneur now this is great perfect governance this is great well I was beginning to sound like Thanksgiving in our house we finally got there but so good news is there's no public policy issues I love you so well you want to go back to our model but that's why Professor Yunus is running for government Bangladesh yes he's gonna do that because he's tired of the corruption holding him up and he's gonna you know he's going global as well but I think to bring this back to entrepreneurship so I think the best thing we can export is entrepreneurial thinking and you know there's sometimes angst well why are we educating people here and then they leave and they go back to the country of origin fine isn't this what we want because we agree that all these problems do not recognize borders we're all in this together we all ought to be educating and moving people around all over the world just you know and and take responsibility for what we do go back to the health care thing though one problem that I have a lot of angst about is we have a shortage of nurses in the United States so what do we do we relax the visa application on nurses and we're bringing in 60 100,000 nurses a year in the United States instead of solving our nursing school problem and paying nurses more so that we will train them here we're bringing them from countries in Africa and Asia which have a desperate need for nurses so this is this lack of global thinking lack of education on the part of our national leaders lack of now if you go train the White House entrepreneurial thinking right we'll get we're going on the bus you know I I'm looking at my colleagues who who do who work on entrepreneurship education here at Stanford I'm looking at who we teach in the audience to see a lot of our students just kept the Eisenhart and Tina Sealegan I have the pleasure of leading the Stanford Technology Ventures program Paul Yacht runs a wonderful program in medical devices called BioDesign Network and let's let's take a moment right now let me allow you to explain that and how it's a multidisciplinary approach because I mean one thing I'm reminded of by listening everybody it's and we do try to encourage our students it is no one size fits all it's very important to take advantage of everything that Stanford has to offer so so this dinner conversation just took a steep turn okay we're gonna go down to yeah let's do yeah now I just give an example of okay so quickly what we do is we try to develop teams of inventors in the medical technology space and what we found been experimenting with us for eight years now that the teams work only when you combine a doc a couple engineers of different flavors a business person you we put the team together for a year we set them on to a real clinical problem broke helps us with those clinical problems to focus on and a couple of things happen so so first of all it's obviously that you need different expertise right that that's that's a given secondly it's obvious that that teams work better than individuals and there's all of you know we know this from athletics and everything else but there's one other thing that's really important and and that has to do with innovation entrepreneurship there is a spark that occurs when you when you throw people who haven't lived together don't speak the same language together in a team and you force them to come up with something and that that is a magical spark that that's a thing that surprised me most I guess out of the program and what role does public policy or you know deployment internationally play in the thinking of these students or they just thinking about is strictly I'll just got to get through the FDA process yeah so that's the problem with the way we've constructed so far and that that's why we're we actually are going to do a new team I hope with Indian nationals that they're gonna do their needs finding in India and and teach the rest of us about that sensibility about doing cost appropriate technology which we have no idea certainly we I know in our classes on entrepreneurship we we have brought in a good bit of discussion about context we call it which is that the externalities the what the entrepreneur doesn't have in their control of the entrepreneurial teams and that includes the public policy issues in international deployment well when you were talking about sort of you know picking what we thought the three big issues were I think I mentioned the two that I the first two but I think we haven't mentioned a third which so I said unsustainability of our current we have living the changing nature of the of current economic organization and technology but I for me and you may say I'm biased given organization I lead but I think we have a big deficit in entrepreneurial thinking because to this day 2007 half of the world's population has had very little say entrepreneurially or otherwise in much of the critical decisions about how our world is currently organized and has been organized for hundreds thousands of years that includes how societies should be developed how economic how economies should run and what economic and work systems should look like what politics we should have how we should live or not live what values we you know what defines a family and that half of the world's population that I'm referring to our women and I think in the way that we see a head of us with technology shifting in the way that it has you know these are changes for which you don't need big muscles and the big muscles that you do need other ones women have plenty of and they're up here and I mean I say this in all earnestness because I think we we profoundly underestimate what it has done to us as a global society to have 51% of our population essentially out of core decision making from the family to the community to how our workplaces are designed to how we conceive of energy and when I think entrepreneur I don't think necessarily of people who make money part of what makes Dr. Eunice's system work and part of what makes our work at the global fund for women possible is that women across the globe have incredibly creative out of the box thinking entrepreneurial risk taking thinking about how things should be organized and for the last you know five thousand years of human history their voices have really not had much of a chance now that's changing and in part it's changing because of technology when you have a system that allows women who are deprived the right to have public space which many women are and you see women using grants from the global fund for women to have internet access and they're there do using email to mobilize and organize then you see the potential for a very different kind of of a vision of how society could be organized when you see people using this kind of technology to be able to increase their voice and their ability to make a difference in their societies you begin to see what potential this kind of entrepreneurial thinking has so I would say that in addition to what we might see in terms of its ability to create capital and new technology I think we have huge untapped resources just waiting to kind of step in and make a difference in terms of the politics and economies and governance systems frankly of our times I mean a recent World Bank report just came out saying when women are actually in significant numbers in charge of a project or a program corruption significantly goes down right I mean this is connected they're not unconnected issues no they're not can I make a point I want to make one comment if you would like to ask a question we're going to do this in a way that sort of you know maximizes our chance to get it answered raise your hand and we're going to distribute little three by five cards during the next portion just raise a hand and us will come by and do a three by five card and then pass them to the end and we'll collect them okay raise your hand and keep them okay thank you so much chip the the point that I would make is the same point that could be just made without a more general level and that is I think it's very risky to slip into a way of thinking about entrepreneurship that somehow associates it with our Americanness as as as our kind of genetic code and that it's our job to teach people the less fortunate people outside the borders of the United States how how to be entrepreneurial some of the most entrepreneurial people I've ever met in my life live in places where you at least expect to find it based on kind of pre-existing notions about political social and economic development in various parts of the world that's 1.2 goes back again to why why has entrepreneurship been so successful in the US context can you say regulatory policy I mean it's kind of like a penetrating glimpse into the obvious right the system this system by and large is structured to reward people for taking risks and when it's when it's the other way around which is what Caviet is talking about it doesn't work I don't care how many seminars you have about free up your imagination you know who this do that it's not it's not going to work if you live in a society that's basically hovering over you so that it can confiscate whatever it is you manage to acquire the part of the world that arguably I know the most about because I certainly not about my own country is is the former Soviet Union Russia in particular and there you have all of the ingredients for kind of an extraordinary economic breakthrough but because of the political culture within which one is forced to function you spend most of your time figuring out how much you're going to have to pay at what level in order to get anything done I mean Russia is arguably one of the most corrupt places in the world it has to do with incentive structures to engage in corrupt practices in Russia is a perfectly rational thing to do because of the governance structure so you need to get those pieces right or else nothing else is going to work so again part of the reason why we have been as successful as a polity as we have been is because of the regulatory structure so as you're writing the questions on the note cards pass them to one of the let's say over there raise your hand Jeff that on that section and in this middle section how about the this aisle here and as a matter of fact in this section bring them to the aisle either way we'll stay away from the cameras thanks so when you're done with your card just bring them to the end and we'll grab them you know what I'm looking at the time and I know it's going to go quickly I wish we I wish we could have breakfast I wish we could have a midnight snack and stay I have so many questions for you you know I'm gonna I'm gonna jump to one because I'm looking around the room and of course the other than my my wonderful members of my family or our family that are here I'm looking at students and you know that that would give me so much hope so I'm gonna ask you a odd question what makes each I mean each one of you have established and I was reminded of buddy this these folks are at the top of their game I mean they're the top of the game in their field and they and I'll I chose them or we chose them because we also knew they had a passion for entrepreneurship and an innovative thinking so I'm gonna ask them what makes you hopeful you know you sort of started down that track you know and that's what got me thinking about that so maybe I'll let you go last this time to come around but I'm still in the popcorn method anybody who wants to just go first is what makes you hopeful right now if you were if we were just sitting with you and me and one of our students in the room I'll take a first swing at that broad cut so so the students I think you know gray here students have changed a lot in in the last 10 years and I'm seeing much more focus on these global issues on entrepreneurship and service of social and I love that I mean it's a terrific time right now we see that in our courses at other academics agree here yeah let me elaborate I mean we come back to this energy crossroads and the origin of it and the students came in October and said we want to do something that gives back to what we're getting from Stanford I mean this really was the conversation as well what do you want what do you want to organize a conference and explore some of these issues that we're talking about this confluence of interest on energy and I said well what are you thinking out it's gonna be three days we're gonna have 60 speakers concurrent sessions all that said you're nuts they said oh no we're not and we're gonna get Tom Friedman and I said you're really nuts yeah I actually believe them on that one because I think if students are Tom Friedman to come they'll come if I did away so they're smart but yeah we worked with them and we got the conference down into you know but they actually came up with the idea they formulated the idea it was their idea in the first place and they said they recognized this problem but they also want to recognize it not only where they had to get an education but they were here to participate in an educational process and they wanted to give back that's what gives me lots of hope it kind of reminds me of Berkeley my undergraduate days without the I'm surprised you remember the other day I was walking into that right just said do not mention Berkeley around my brother what about you Chip what makes you hopeful what makes me hopeful is the quality of people from Stanford who go into public life public service I've taught here for a very very long time shortly after the invention of fire when people ask me to do it now it's true it's been a really long time and the students interested in the kinds of issues that I teach about have always been good the quality has just gone up and up and up and up and up over the years and increasingly they not only think of public services a part of their obligation but public life and that includes a willingness for the first time in a long time for people to stand for elective office so I'm actually very very hopeful about this and it's I'm not exactly sure how to account for it but it's it's a very very positive trend and it's not just at Stanford so yeah nurse as well care Brooke locally if you take if you take Silicon Valley of an example I think the valley has come to its at least it's midlife crisis if you want to think about it that way where there are enough people who have made enough wealth doing whatever they did they're still finding a vacuum the vacuum of giving back and doing something and I think when they think that way they're saying do I want to do one more of the same thing that I did to add Delta to an increment out is not going to matter in the long run or am I going to do something good and I think I see that a lot in the valley okay that gives me hope the second thing that I see is I'm on Stanford campus so the very last line in Tom Friedman's book that you talked about comes from Bob Romer who says a crisis is a terrible thing to waste okay so that comes from him and you you know you guys are students and so what I see as a hope out there is really that beaver in a regime in this world where for a price you could get things that mean that meant that the rich could have whatever they wanted and I'm a creative I think there's a realization coming within us that when resource trumps capital which is slowly where we're coming it doesn't matter if you have money I'm not going to give you my water rights even if I'm poor because it's cool the same thing is happening with all sorts of materials that makes us think very differently from a sustainable perspective and that's the crisis we're just coming into and why we why didn't we do it earlier necessity some other invention it wasn't necessary then it's necessary now so in fact as much as we may have argued on policy I'm totally on the same side those economies go up and that you know you ask about my passion the reason I'm passionate about what I do is I truly believe that in the middle of Africa where it's totally dark if you look at it and no infrastructure the new technologies that you guys develop that don't need infrastructure that use local resources the only way they're going to get power and the fact that we need that kind of power is the only reason we're going to invent it for them and that's the beauty okay well and I would add that what gives me hope is that in fact there are people in those places who may very well be coming up with the technology I mean I have had the pleasure of making a grant to increasingly sophisticated individual entrepreneurs a woman physician in Uzbekistan on the Aral Sea who began to see the connections between birth defects showing up in her patients who she's an OBGYN she wasn't trained as an as an environmentalist but she was beginning to see what was happening with her patients she she dug back into the root causes found it was connected to the desalination the salination of the Aral Sea what was happening in terms of pesticide use in the region there is now a massive program that is being spearheaded by local women who you know are farmers and are challenging the basis of how that economy is organized I mean to me I think Africa to me is a perfect example some of the most creative work on how to think about new policy structures how to bring voices of dispossessed marginalized people into the conversation and how to think about when you say necessity is the mother of invention the places that don't have power are the most likely to be the places where people are thinking creatively about how you can harness what local resources there are and so I think there's going to be some very exciting there is already I mean we receive over 3,500 proposals a year from women's organizations many of whom are organizations where the women have dictated the application because they're illiterate but they have brilliant created some of the inventions that started that company in sort of you know define modern entrepreneurship police Silicon Valley style but do you have anything to say or should I get the questions so hopeful two areas one on the energy side in the newspaper today you're all reading about TXU the big buyout of the utility company in Texas and what I like about this as someone who's followed environmental defense and NRDC and all this so far they were called ahead of time to help that deal be made now this is a deal of just you know super powerful finance organizations and usually they just think about you know the economics of it all but here are now you know maybe I'm thinking maybe we're at the tipping point of this whole thing about energy sustainability alternative sources of energy because not only are they going from 11 to three new co power plants as a commitment in state of Texas now the governor has kind of has new quotes out now that he really likes this this kind of deal and they're committing to developing new sources of energy wind solar fuel cells and so on like that so something's going on there and the new report by the international committee on climate change the thing that I'm the another thing I'm very hopeful about is just the science and if we go back to the science so all these things we talk about seems so huge where's the slingshot where's the turning point where's the leverage going into public policy is huge leverage I think Stanford people have figured that out you want to have a big change go do that and the leverage with science is amazing and I think in medicine and healthcare we can reduce healthcare costs we can miniaturize it all and we can get it can be deployed by people with very little healthcare training around the world because we're coming out of the dark ages about how all that works because of genomics and the kind of miniaturization nanotechnology that people like Paul Yock and his group are developing well I have to take advantage of having you here to ask you some questions like especially the following one it's pretty clear we're not to be able to get through all of them so I'm gonna in the next 12 minutes so when I urge everybody and I'll say it again that we're when we break at six there is a wonderful showcase of technologies out of the labs of Stanford put on by the office of technology and licensing technology licensing over at Packard which is just across the atrium and in the courtyard so please come over and join us and and we can you know probably do that in even more informally than this dinner conversation we're having ask us 15 second answers oh here we go it's like a game show right deal or no deal here we go all right this and I love this one to become a global leader in areas like healthcare energy and policy things were told about what skills will be relevant and how would you go about developing if you were 21 years old again the time machine 10 to 10 all right learn one language that is not English good and be fluent in it okay I know what we'll vote for the best answer in the end okay so remember this learn one language okay chip cap off your disciplinary training by interdisciplinary education so that you understand more than one thing well language interdisciplinary education in whatever skillset you are deconstruct the problem see where the efficiency flaws are fine efficiency you're so intellectual I think learned to deal with uncertainty in a real way understanding uncertainty and how to deal with it in making decisions is fundamentally what it's all about because nothing is cut and dried absolutely good Paul picks three other people who are smarter than you in work I just pick six that was easy find a mentor find a mentor all right everybody got those all right we'll do this real quickly I'm voting what do you think of that one yeah okay mentor let me guess what was that three smart two three smart two and we know what's gonna win it's the deconstructing I'm going to have with it we know it's good good okay is that because no Americans are willing to learn another language oh here we go this is a big debate on campus now because it's a trend can you be an entrepreneur and a non-profit absolute yeah this is an NGO so maybe we should we should recuse or you should but can you be this comes up a good bit in our in our courses and they're and we even have competitions at solcums of social entrepreneurship versus for profit I mean how much of it is it odds I know we touched a little bit on and earlier but can you be an entrepreneur and I think it has nothing to do with for profit alone okay it's John set it up you know it's focus it's a way of thinking it's willingness to fail it's thinking big it's it's going and go attack problems that no one's working on don't be you know in entrepreneurship and in a small business in Silicon Valley you don't go start the fifth company doing what's already been out you go do something that's not being gone after there's you know president Carter foreign the Carter Center and Atlanta and may many of you know he works on on global health issue he works on health care problems no one else is working on so he doesn't do things that other that are people are into and so the frustrating thing to me of some nonprofits is they replicate what's going yeah so John Dore you know if you you know many of you have heard him talk there's an entrepreneur is somebody who can do a lot more than anything than anybody thinks is possible with a lot less than anybody thinks is possible a lot faster than anybody thinks is possible you can be in the federal government can be an entrepreneur absolutely I mean that's what you're not in your head because that's that's how you that's probably a big criteria for your grants right oh absolutely I mean I would say that the way we work is essentially about who to invest in and how Bill Hulek made a decision about investing in the startup of the global fund which didn't happen in a garage but in a kitchen and my expectation is that there going to be a lot more kitchens around the world cooking up some really interesting stuff and the next you know watch this century guys I think it's I think there's there's no question about that so Chip can you be an entrepreneur in government you can innovate in government but it's much much harder because government bureaucracies are the physical embodiment of of Veyberianism right I mean that is what it means to be a bureaucracy and they're good reasons and you can be a good policy entrepreneur and that's the stories we all like to tell and I came with three stories that I won't tell today that are good news stories about you know entrepreneurship yielding good policy bear in mind all in north was also a policy entrepreneur and that got us that got us Iran contra so there are reasons why governments function the way they do but it is possible to do it and it's possible to do it by reference to a set of kind of respectable policy goals in full compliance with the law any comments from the rest all right let's see if we can find it oh oh happy all right well we touched on early so let's go for it it seems like the US has forgotten Latin America and that's why we see massive immigration from the south I mean it kind of wasn't mentioned we need to lift the people out of poverty any ideas this is a fellow from Peru Olga I'm sorry I'm going from Peru I want to do something a little well I think you can borrow from a number of models that have been successful around the world the Chinese have elevated three to four hundred million people out of poverty since Deng Xiaoping started the reform process and since the Chinese Communist Party fully embraced it in 1984 it comes with a certain social cost we all understand I mean it's a there is a ruling party and it's also a very corrupt place I think basically you can put in place sensible economic policies and social policies regulatory policies to to change incentives it that that can eventually in people becoming less poor than they are and hopefully at some point more affluent by reference to a sustainable model it's not rocket science it's fundamentally about political leadership as it always is and it's fundamentally about the correctability of systems and the less correct the system is the more efficient it tends to be and the more progress you can make also less income inequality so yeah it's possible sure I know a lot of Latin American feministas who would say it's kind of good that the US has forgotten about Latin America for a while the kind of intervention we've seen over 50 years prior to this hasn't necessarily always brought Latin America the kind of results that it would have liked to see and so you know there's there are some classes and minuses to not being on the radar screen actually you know there's a lot we can learn from you know Costa Rica for example you talk about natural capitalism and how to value conservation and how to promote conservation so world leader Albert Mania who was a student at Stanford Alvaro Mania who was a student at Stanford it became the first minister of state for the environment under the area government actually came up for this this this idea and so you know it's not a matter of you know I'm teaching them I think we should open our eyes and start learning you know a lot about them go to Peru there are pre-inca terraces there that are still being farmed 700 years after they were they were created and the water supply systems that feed those terraces they're still farming them they got something right they learned they knew something about sustainability maybe we should start learning from them how about this one as the last one because this is after all the entrepreneurial thought leaders similar series and we would try to take that kind of cut at these these big challenges like so this is business models all right how do you monetize a global problem like CO2 reduction you know till and this is a comment here until the problem is monetized capitalist countries will not solve the problem or maybe another way to put it as entrepreneurs will not solve the problem at least entrepreneurs were talking about yeah I agree I mean I think if you evaluate a project you should do a life cycle cost analysis of that project and so all the costs that go into it have to be factored in and then make and and charge accordingly and so you pay the true cost of whatever thing so if you want to put a subsidy into to reduce the cost and keep the price of gasoline for example artificially low then you're not going to get any progress on CO2 but if you put the real cost in there and you monetize the cost of the CO2 emissions then you can start making progress because at that point and you're looking in a life cycle things that might not make any sense start making a hell of a lot more sense and we'll get a market and I'll become more competitive because of the fact that you've you've put a real level the playing field kind of basis for for evaluating alternatives so you like the cap and trade model then it has there are the aspects of it that I do the parts of it that I you know right there's there's our I mean one of our California Energy Commission is hot Rosenfeld has proposed alternative ways with fee bates will you sort of pay a fee if you don't do certain things and you get rebates if you don't so they're sort of a carrot and stick but I think it is about monetizing this ultimately so that you the true life cycle costs are incorporated in evaluating any alternative I was just going to say that in a way on the gender issue that's what Amartes ended with the issue of missing women in the economist Amartes and who received the Nobel Prize a few years ago amongst the women's movement internationally is revered because he uh Bangladesh and the the ability to do that and to realize what the actual human resource cost of that is to to a country takes it away from just sort of a moral issue of saying well you know this is a terrible way to treat people because x and y and and puts a real price on what that means for the future of a country's development so I mean I think there's some real reasons for us to get smart about that kind of work I wish we had more time I have so many not done with these questions but even some of the ones that we had developed um and now what would love to hear your stories I I uh let's do this again let's have dinner again maybe in a year maybe in a two we'll check in for all your students in those listening we actually do something like this every Wednesday afternoon believe it or not maybe not quite as grand and not and certainly not as many speakers some of the uh the folks in this panel have participated in that and that is the uh entrepreneurial thought leader seminar series and it was particularly um I'm particularly pleased that we were able to pull this together this week as part of entrepreneurs week because this is hump day on entrepreneurs week we started last Saturday and we're halfway through a number of you especially the students in the room are participating in a contest that is uh I guess you're gonna work a lot tonight because uh I guess your early entries are coming into moral and hopefully you'll be down here as a finalist on right in this stage uh on Saturday so I want everybody to join me in thanking Brooke Paul Jeff K.R Chip and Kavita for an amazing hour and a half
