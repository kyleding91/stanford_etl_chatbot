 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Today's guests are very, very special to me. I met both Mickey and Wences a couple of years ago down in Chile and was totally impressed. The two of them have started several companies together and really made some terrific contributions. Wences is originally from Argentina and Mickey is from Venezuela and they've got a great story about how they met, how they got together, what brought them here to Silicon Valley and all the ventures they've had. I know that they're going to tell us a lot about what it means to be an entrepreneurial team and what's made them so successful. They are the co-founders currently of blame nation and I can't wait to hear their story. Without further ado, what's its name? Thank you very much, Tina. Thank you very much for having us. When Tina invited us to talk, she suggested a theme that we have informally talked with Tina and with others about that is the importance of an entrepreneurial partnerships. The partners use start something with the co-founders if you will. We've talked a lot about it and we see something that we've paid a lot of attention. Mickey and I have been working together for over 13 years. We've never given a talk like this about it so it made it at the same thing very interesting to do something that we haven't done before but also more challenging than repeating some talks that we have done before. We believe that we do a lot of, or not a lot, but a little bit of angel investing and we realize that when we look at a very early stage company that we are considering and investing, all of us without realizing we pay a lot of attention about the founding team and especially the dynamics within the founding team. We think that it's something that is very often overlooked. I like boats a lot, sailboats in particular. I bought used sailboats a few times and I learned that sometimes instead of trying to go over and go over the technical specs of what this boat has, when they added this, when they added that, how many miles it has, where it has been. If they tell me a story about the previous owners, it's much more easy to understand everything and everything falls in place. It's a couple and he really likes to sail but she didn't want to sail and so he put their conditioning so she wouldn't leave and that and everything. All of a sudden things that were very hard to make sense in the tech spreadsheet make a lot of sense. I find the same thing with companies. A lot of things that are hard to understand and make a lot more sense when you understand the partnerships that drive those companies. I think it's no coincidence when you look at some of the most important successes in Silicon Valley but elsewhere, you see very strong partnerships at the core of those successes. Also, when you see companies that fail, the usual explanation is we run out of money but that's a consequence of something else. Of course, we run out of money but why did you run out of money? They may follow that explanation by saying, well, we didn't get a good product market fit or there was a problem with a product or a problem with a marketing and that's still a consequence. When you think difference, why did you have that problem? Very often we see problems that have to do with dynamics between the partners. I think that is something that is very often overlooked. Many more companies fail because of the dynamics between people and then number one focus for bad dynamics is the dynamics between the partners. This is very important on both sides and we informally have talked a lot about this the many things that we have done together with Mickey over a little over 13 years. The talk today, we wanted to summarize what we think we've learned. This is probably a never ending task but there are some things that we think we learn or when we see a team that we can see is a strong team, is a weak team, what we like, what we don't and in our own sort of dynamics. Mickey has a lot of opinions about this. Some of them are similar to mine and some are very different. I think that what we've learned in 13 years, I'm going to summarize it in five words and then we'll go over and give you the whole history. But it's a partnership where it works because I have the looks and he has the brains. That's the key for it. We're going to go over it but you're going to come back and see it's about the looks and the brains. I had to let him say that because he wouldn't let me preempt that. We met in 1997 in Argentina. I was starting a business. I was transforming a very small online broker, a very small traditional brokerage house, shut down the traditional brokerage operations and was relaunching it exclusively as an online broker like an E3, the first one in Latin America to do that. When I had this crazy guy from Venezuela, I never left. I've never been to Venezuela or Colombia anytime before so I assume he had to be a narco or something like that. Waiting at my office. Do you remember Mickey how we met? Yes, we met in 1997 and we had this very short meeting where I was doing the same thing he was doing but from Venezuela and we immediately clicked. It was an immediately inaction of looking for the same purpose both from the same kind of backgrounds. Both had started our own companies with what we had and we had to convince people to run it. That same night something important that in retrospect, we look back, it's one of the keys of our partnership. That was probably in the summer of 1997. He was polite enough after me asking to go out and have some beers because I took the flight all the way to Argentina to meet him and when we're in the bar having some beers, a long story about we end up in a bar fight. And I got beat up first and then Mickey said my ass. And after that process we ended up running together for like 10 blocks away from taking from the guys. But something clicked there. Some important factor about trust. There we were two guys met that same day and even after that we were covering one's others ass and trying to make it out of the place alive. And it has stuck to us. It was an important component so I guess that one of the key learnings from that is that particular story for us. We always tell it as a funny story but it is true when we look back that it sort of has more meaning than it sounds. Mickey came to visit me out of the blue and he said hey, I've heard that you're a good techie and I thought I was a good techie. I can call. I had done the first Internet service provider in Argentina before this and I was trying to deploy this first online broker in Argentina but I didn't even have a bank account at the time and I truly did not know anything about finding. And that was something that he was trying to stress. And he was saying look, you may be very good at technology but you are clueless about finance you need me. Mickey had started his first online broker when he was 17 which should be legal but in Venezuela he somehow managed to have a broker. A broker dealer at age 17 so by the time we were 23 then. So he was quite experienced for a 23 year old with financial markets and with broker dealer houses in particular. So the proposal was you do the technology, I'll take care of the broker dealer business and it took a while for us to agree on terms and etc. But we agreed to merge the two companies. We thought I wanted the headquarters to be Buenos Aires, he wanted the headquarters to be in Caracas. So we agreed to have the headquarters in Miami. And we used the combined entity to acquire a seat in every exchange because to buy and sell securities you have to have a seat on that exchange. And it was still is but back then you had more awkward process to get this seats in inexpensive Latin America. So we used the combined entity to acquire a seat in every exchange from Mexico down to Chile. The company grew really really fast for a couple of years and it was acquired by Vanco Santander for a little over $750 million in cash. And Mickey and I had to stay and work for them. For me the main lesson from when we were doing Patta on Latin America is and I compare that to a lot of founding teams that we meet with is that in general I find a lot more success when the founding team has met and sort of chosen each other based on merit and some meritocratic way. And it may be that then because of the things that you go through together starting a company you sort of have no choice but and become friends. Often the opposite is not true. When you start when you see teams that started being friends and then they tried to also become good partners. I'm not saying it's impossible but it's a when we see teams like that it brings a yellow light not the right one but it's harder because you have to. You have to take a number of decisions that is very hard to take with someone who you didn't choose based on merit but you chose based on friendship and attachment or emotion etc. And in our case it happened by chance the other way around and we think that there is something to that way of becoming a partner starting with something that is based on merit and if it goes from there to friendship that's fine but don't go the other way around. We have to stay and work for Van Gogh and then there for four years. They wouldn't let us work on the Latin American business that we sold them. And basically all of what we sold them was a Latin American business. And they were paying us a lot of money to stay there. So they asked us say look you guys come up with something else but they have very large operations in Latin America and they were handing those operations the business that they bought from us. You guys come up with something else that you want to help with. And it was basically Mickey that put that business plan together. We were, this was March of 2000 or April of 2000 and we decided that the best business opportunity to do with them in Europe was trying to build the first online bank. There was ING doing it somewhere up in the Netherlands. There was a company in the UK trying to build an online bank but there was no one doing it in Spain and Germany. So we put this plan together to do it with Santander. And at the time that particular process at the end when says was not there, you were sailing somewhere in the Antarctic. And there was no cell phone at the time, there was no way to communicate. And we had to make a very last minute regulatory decision because we were getting a bank. We were buying a bank and we were being named CEO's banks. And I just took the decision to put my name and be the CEO of the entire business while he was traveling. And when he came back and he opened his computer, first thing he sees is all over the place my name. And you know many partnerships can have broken right there. It's like you stop someone in the back. But I think the formula for us is a ego. We leave, we have a lot of ego from the door out when we are doing businesses but when we're together, there's nothing like that. We leave it at the door. Yeah. I still remember the shock. I left being the CEO and I came back and Mickey was the CEO. But all it took was a phone call to understand why it was the best decision and never doubting that it was done in the best interest of our company. And it's a tricky thing because I believe that to be an entrepreneur you need to have a high ego or at least a very strong conviction about what you think that the world is going, about your own abilities. So it would be very hard to be an entrepreneur with low ego. I don't know if that's possible. So like Mickey says, from the door outwards you need to have a very, very high strong ego, strong conviction. But between the partners, I think that the low ego requirement, it's almost a required, a good partnership cannot work without that. And it means not only funny situation, like this, but in many other situations, not needing to take the merit for the things that you think you deserve. Whether you think you deserve them or not to be fine with the other partners taking the credit. And sometimes you see partnership when one of the two partners is okay not taking the credit and the other one needs the credit. That can work. I think it's healthier when neither of the partners really cares who takes that as long as the partnership is successful. And we were 27 at the time and these things become a lot more clear with time and with perspective. But I don't think we had it that clear at the time looking back. I think we are convinced that that's a very important element. That bank, both in Spain and in Germany, was the fastest growing bank for three years in a row. They grew to be 9 billion euros in deposits. When you go to that size, a bank of Santa Claus acquired our stakes. And for a period of time, we went on to do different things. I remember when I was dating my wife for a couple of years and it was quite serious. Then we broke up. And I remember my friends telling, don't get back together because if you get back to her now, you get married. And I had a number of friends for which that is true. And then it was true for me. We got back together and we got married. And I always say that's what happened to me with Mickey. We went on after doing Patagon was a very intense few years. I went on to start a video game company that then was acquired by Activision. Mickey went on to start a classified company that was acquired by Mercado Libre. We were partners in a number of businesses at the time. And even in these businesses, he was an investor in my business and in the board and vice versa, et cetera. But it was a very healthy experience to feel like you're choosing a partner. It was not imposed on us. And a very strong sense that the timing is right. Right after that, or actually happened in between when we were still working on those companies, we started working on a business plan that we had been toying around for a very long time, actually, since the beginning of Patagon, which was how to use technology to bring financial services to the underbank, to the bottom of the pyramid, especially in Latin America. You want to tell the story how we got started with that, Mickey? So we had a lot of our experience with Patagon, with our first company. We liked the country that we had liked the most was Brazil. Now in 2011, it's easy to say why Brazil? It's booming, it's all over. But this was, we were there in 98 to 2000, not particularly the best time. In 2002, when we decided to move there, it was a new president who was just up in the polls, a new candidate who was up in the polls who came from the left. It was a very contrarian time to look at Brazil. But that's what it takes. It takes to, as an entrepreneur, we both get the appetite as partners also to go out when we see that there's nothing happening. We are contrarians by the sheer nature. That's what drives us as a partnership. And we went and we applied for a banking license. We were 28 at the time and it was a regulatory compliance process that I can give you another lecture about. And after it was given to us, we started a business. We started a bank to serve that particular segment. I moved to Brazil. I didn't know the language. I had to learn Portuguese. The first words I learned was how do you describe a balance sheet in Portuguese? And then I had to learn about soccer and then the rest. So that's a little bit of the business that we were building there. I think there's, we were not together at the time. We were not spending the whole time together. I took some time to sail again. And we were talking with Niki every day, even when I was in the middle of the Pacific on a sailboat. And that one day I was literally in the middle of a crossing in the middle of the Pacific. And my wife comes out. I was at the helm and she comes out and she says, the toilet stopped working. When you're in the middle of the Pacific, it means go fix the toilet. So I go down and I push this button and it goes like, I hear some pump. I'm not familiar with this one. And it doesn't work. You know, I have sort of a window straining. So I push the button again. Maybe it's time it works. And I got exasperated and I pushed it many times and I could like, well, well, well, it wasn't going anywhere. So I had to, I lift the floor boards and there's this much space between the floor and the bottom of the boat where all the pipes and the cables are starting to figure out what is water and everything's very packed. And I see these pipes and I figure this big one must be it. And I knock here and I feel like full and I knock here and it feels like empty and I consider so wide, dividing. It must be stuck in there and I hit it. And then I loosen something and I pull out. And the second I did, I thought I realized that it was a bad idea but it was too late. And it won't, I need to explode it on me. And at the time I was, I was in a Bohemian face. I had long hair, a beard. I couldn't believe what was going on. I had to jump on the ocean, I had to stop. It took forever to clean that boat. And that night, we were, you know, as a partnership when you are building a business, one of the things was talk. We talked every single day, every day, no matter where we were. And that day I was, I remember perfectly I had this, I was in a northern part of Brazil, wherever it was, there was a low income area, I was in the middle of a favela area. And we had a very rough day, very, very rough day in the business. And that night I called him and I said, you know what, I just had a very shitty way. I was so upset when she said that, I said, no, no, let me tell you how it is. So it's a communication. I mean, that made my day look like it was okay, I could live for another day. And that's what it took. It took a lot of that. It's been able to communicate more than average. I mean, we overcommunicate. And it's the only way to have a very coherent think through process. So we had other times where we were going overcommunicating, and Mickey says, we were going for lunch every day, just the two of us, and going over all the issues that we had in our mind that we wanted to bounce back and forth or make decisions on, etc. And at one point, as the band got larger, I said, you know, why don't we start going to lunch? You go with some people and go with another group. It would probably be good that we don't do this. Lunch is just the you and I alone. It'd be very helpful that we use them to spend time with the rest of the team. And also at the same time, we had our desks in an open office, but our desks were together and I decided to put them on opposite ends. And it was a disaster of an experiment. In less than three months, we were back to having the lunches, just the two of us again, and the desks together again. And when we try to figure out why that's in it work, it's because when it's very, we think it's very important that the partnership be perceived from the rest of the organization as one. The thing has started a conversation with Mickey and keep it going with me if they don't see Mickey the next day, etc. And it has to feel like one and for that, you have to be really overcommunicated. So when we have issues between us and we have tons of them, that they don't become public and open to the organization, not for a matter of secrecy or not being transparent sort of the opposite is because it would be a problem for people to understand what to do, who to follow direction from, etc. So when you have all of these agreements to keep that just between ourselves, but also always when it's outwe're facing to show one face that one we agree. And if there's something that I don't agree, I know that we are showing that other decision that I disagree with, and till I can convince him somehow, but it would be very, very counterproductive to the partnership that we show those different faces and other organizations that's not what to do with that, etc. But acting as one, we think it's super important and it requires overcommunicated to the point where it can be funny, even if you're in the middle of a Pacific, you may get a call at night to see what they were like. Abligation, you want to frame this meeting? Yes, in 2007, we were in a, we were with our wives traveling and when says come we're in India. And he says, you know, I have this, let me put some context, this was before the iPhone even came out. The iPhone was not even in the market. I have this vision that we're going to be using the phone to pay and that the phone is going to become a very important instrument in our financial world. And I think that there's an opportunity that it's going to happen and we're going to be spending the next 30 years of our life using our phones as much more than what we are thinking. And by the time there was no software, the phones were all locked, they had nothing you cannot do anything on them. So I looked at him and he said, what are you doing? What are you thinking? And but by now, after 10 years together, you build a certain level of trust. Important trust at any level. I mean, trust from being a CEO when he's not or vice versa, being able to talk and over communicate. And when you get one of the partners in a, with that level of motivation, the trust becomes an important aspect for success. So this, I was living at the time, I was in between Brazil and Venezuela. Had a, we were both with small kids. And this was February of 2007. And by August of 2007, we both had relocated to Silicon Valley. We both had moved our families here. We had no clue what we were going to do with it. But we decided that based on the trust that we have and our ability to work as a team, this was a place to do it. And we moved our entire personal circle with us now to here to start this. And it, it didn't feel so crazy at the time when we did it. That's time goes by. We look back and it feels like a, a crazier move. We started, shortly after we started, the iPhone came out and that pretty much changed dramatically the, the, the mobile landscape. We started issuing, we started focusing on enabling consumers to pay at the retail location by tapping their phones, issuing these stickers that we call BlinkTax with an RFID sticker. And we do that. We started doing that with banks. We deployed with 17 different banks across the country in communities of less than 200,000 people. And we felt that that didn't allow us to grow the way we wanted. We were at the mercy of the banks to acquire more consumers. So we did a partnership with PayPal to go directly to the consumers through PayPal and bypass the banks. We did a pilot here in the Bay Area with PayPal. And then we found the problem was the cost. It was too expensive for us to acquire the merchants. And we improved that a lot, but we couldn't make it economic. We couldn't make it work. We started focusing on very large merchants. And shortly after we started focusing on the large merchants, so did the very, very large companies like Google, AT&T and Verizon with, with ISIS, with their joint venture and even PayPal itself. And then after this very large merchant with a value proposition that we couldn't match, subsidizing Google alone is subsidizing almost 500 million dollars worth of hardware. A lot of ISIS is subsidizing a lot of advertising dollars. And after when that began to happen, we decided to regroup. And that's where we are right now in the blink nation. Taking some elements, some small elements that we think worked and getting rid of a lot of things that we haven't been able to work to relaunch hopefully in a month or so. I also find in this process, that is a very hard process of iterating, changing, recognizing what has failed, go with something else, having a partner who you can trust and share these impressions you have in an intellectually honest way as possible, it's invaluable. We didn't have that trust, it would be much more likely that you would just keep trying with something that maybe you know that is not the right thing to do. And I think that has become very obvious in what we're doing in a blink nation. I try to think why is that we think that the importance of these entrepreneurial partnerships are so important. And why sometimes we think that there are much more important than some of the individual skills in management team, much more important than the specific technology or business plan. And we think that that may be the case because even though you don't learn that by reading the books or in school or nobody tells you the hardest part of doing a startup is the emotional demands that you will go through. Having the right partner, the right entrepreneurial partner allows you to go through those emotional demands in a much healthier way where you can discuss all of the things that you are obsessing about, you can be much more open, much more open that you could be maybe with your investors or that you could be with your team and allows you to go through things not only much faster than you would on your own, but also with a much more high quality output of decisions. And it has definitely been the case in our case and we wanted to share that story with you guys. Thank you. That was absolutely terrific and I think you have some time to take some questions. Yes, great. I like you moderate yourself. All right. Yes. At the barbush, which of you does start? We were sitting at a... He started it? I didn't. He started it and I had to come in and... We were sitting at the bar that you can see on both sides. Just like a table, Mickey was sitting on this side and I was sitting on this side and I was very crowded. There were a couple of other friends around us and we were talking and all of a sudden I saw a hand coming at me very hard and the next thing I remember is I was flying back and I hit the wall and apparently with some girl I was looking at or something like that. Yes. What are some of the big challenges that you see retailers facing as consumers increasingly can pay by phone and other means? What are some of the top things that retailers are going to have to adjust to? So the question is what do you think retailers need to adjust as more people start to interact with their phones? I think that the retailers are in the best position of all. They control the experience at the store. They control the value that they're willing to give each one of us for our business, for us doing our shopping there. So actually I will argue that there right now if you look at the landscape, there we offer from 10 different companies access to more and more ways of generating value at the store. So it's the other way around. I think that the challenge is for anybody who wants to work with retailers is what do you have that is different that will find compelling value from them and interest from them to work with you. Especially the large retail, I agree with that. I think the retailers, especially the large retailers are in a unique position that they haven't been in a long time, where all of the players are going after them. In most cases they are exclusive offers. They have to choose to work with one or the other but not with more than one of these large players that are going after them at the same time. So as the market is right now they seem to be in a great position. I do see the combination of mobile and social creating more of a shift in consumer behavior and how we shop than e-commerce did. And it seems like retailers or many retailers didn't take the threat of e-commerce seriously enough and they've lost depending on the categories but anywhere from 6 to 15% market share to e-commerce because they didn't take it seriously enough early on when they should have taken it seriously enough. And I think a little bit of a repeat but probably with much bigger consequences may be playing out right now where the combination of social and mobile may change market share more dramatically than e-commerce did and the retailers are being even more passive than they were with e-commerce. Yeah. So you guys have lived in Latin America in Europe and not in Silicon Valley and I understand that there are three different very drastic different cultural traits of all those three places. What do you guys think about entrepreneurship in Latin America right now in Europe and Silicon Valley just because most of the people in Trashon students and from Panama people want to come here to Silicon Valley. So you know start a business because there are so many people 21, 22 year old guys trying to start companies here. What do you think a 21 year old guy should do if they're from Europe, from Latin America? Should they come to Silicon Valley or is it a good start to do it in your home country and then move on to Silicon Valley? You want to start? Oh. Yeah. I think it's very difficult and maybe I responsible to give sort of a blanket answer to that it depends for each person, for each startup idea depending on what you're chasing or trying to accomplish. I think that one, the entrepreneurial ecosystems are incredibly different in Europe, in Silicon Valley and in Latin America. And in Latin America, doing a startup anywhere in the world, it's hard. It's a game that the numbers do not look very favorable. If you, whatever it is, it's 1%, 10%, if you want to be incredibly generous, will be successful. But let's say it's 1%, and that's a chance of 0.01. When in Latin America, any business forget about a startup. Has a 1% chance of surviving the ups and downs of the economy, the lack of a strong institutional framework or rule of law, et cetera, et cetera. It's much, much harder for companies in general to operate in this environment of very high friction than it is in the US or in Europe. And when you combine those chances of sort of the startup chances times the Latin America or emerging market high friction, the result, it's an exponentially low. The risk gets compounded and the upside doesn't get compounded at all. In many cases, the upside is less than in the developed world because the markets are smaller. So unless there is a very clear angle on how you know the market or a very specific opportunity, et cetera, I think that this tradeoff of going to emerging markets because there's less competition is not necessarily a clear tradeoff that it pays off. There may be more competition here, but when you're executing in a place like Silicon Valley, you're focused 80% of the time in creating value and 20% of the time with dealing with a friction that comes with doing anything. In Latin America, in most places, you are lucky if you can focus 40% of the time to creating value and 60% of the time is dealing with friction, which for a startup, it's asphyxiation can kill them very easily. There is a practical example that we learn when we move here. In South America or in Europe, as an entrepreneur, whenever you start a company and you believe in it yourself, you typically put your own money to it. And you start and that gives you much more credibility than any other aspect. You know, that's what they want to see in those environments that you're willing to raise your own network to build a business. In Silicon Valley, it's a very, it's wire differently. Here to be credible, to be able to talk to a business, a retailer, or anyone that you want to build a company around, you need to show that you're venture backed. And that's just one little example of a big difference when you get to choose a market. You know, those venture capital industry, it's not that sophisticated nor exists so well in Latin America yet. Nor in Europe, it's there, but it's not as broad as Silicon Valley. So those are some of the examples of things that you have to handle when you make a decision where you want to be. If I were an emerging market entrepreneur who's very familiar with Silicon Valley, I would be looking at opportunities where I could develop a product and a business from Panama or wherever it is and using the local talent, which sometimes you'll be surprised, you know, the quality of the talent you can get there can be much better than what you can get here. Because, and that's very counterintuitive, but here the talent is not only expensive, but the best talent is often taken by the very large company. So when you look at the startups, they will have one brilliant engineer per every four to nine good average engineers. In Panama, you may have the luxury of creating a team of nine brilliant engineers. That's very, very hard to do in Silicon Valley. And I think it's just a matter of time before we see a world-class company addressing the world markets and the developed world markets from the emerging markets. Actually, I think that the biggest reason why that is not happening is sort of self-imposed censorship if you will. There are entrepreneurs who have the right ideas to do from Vietnam or from Panama or from Turkey and that they would like to launch them to the developed world from their market. But they don't do because they haven't seen people do it before and they think it's impossible. And I just think we have to see the first examples of that to be into see a big trend in that way, especially in mobile where I think some of these markets are very advanced in how they use the mobile phone. There's a question over there. Yeah. You talked a little bit about the distribution of work that we need to, especially now when people know how to be anything, and also your decision-making process. So the question is, is how do we divide the roles between us? And what's the decision-making process? Yeah. We don't divide the roles. We always show one coherent owner, one coherent manager, one coherent founder, one coherent CEO. We will always try to be together, analyze and over communicate. So if it's something that I hear from somebody talking to me about an issue of technology, I typically will listen, will understand, will try to figure out an answer, but I will most probably go back, talk to Wences, define and come back even if we don't agree. It's the answer that I took at the time. And vice versa. And we will try to, but when you over communicate, you fix that. If you sort of divide roles, we see that that's a formula for lots of problems. Unless you guys, I mean, unless the partnership is well enough built that you exactly know your expertise and each one is comfortable executing on them. We sense that we are not good enough for that. So we need two of us to do one good guy. And we do it together. I think that different partnerships work differently. And we've seen examples of people who work very, very differently. And it works very well for them. But for us, as Miki says, we try to have the company interact with us as if we were one. And it's not that they have to come to me with marketing issues and they have to go to Miki for strategic issues or what have you. They can come with either. And we know which ones I rather check and which ones I can just go. And that's why they sort of they're over communicating. It's so important. But that's just the recipe that works for us. And I wouldn't say that it's their recipe. There are as many as there are people. Yep. Yep. What's as you said, you often disagree with each other. Do you give us two or three examples of times of disagreeing? Yeah. We disagree. Yeah, the question is that if we could give examples of times with disagree, I have to pick the right ones. The ones that are favorable for me. Let me see. I mean, we recently did took one of the hardest decisions that we ever had to take together, which was to stop a lot of what we were doing with leg nation. And one of us was of the idea that we had to keep trying that there were incremental improvements we could do that would make enough of a difference. And another one was of the difference that it didn't matter how much of a change we could do that the dynamic of the market was such that it wasn't a place for a startup to be there. And it was quite fundamental discussion and the position, it wasn't like I believe this, but I don't care. We were very strongly held positions. And it's a typical position that would be a problem for the rest of the organization to see through that. And we can go in every business. I mean, every week I can tell you what is it that we are disagreeing at the time. Do you have an example, Niki? I think that's the most recent one. Yeah. We've tried to fix it by boxing and too long for him. We have a pinpontario now and no match. But the most, one thing that works for us very well is that we will, because it's two and because when each one has a strong opinion, you are and he's smarter than I am. Remember the first phrase I told you in the beginning? It makes you have to build your arguments better. I have to convince him or vice versa. He has to convince me. And sometimes that takes a lot of time. I have to, it's not about a thought that I had that, oh, I'm going to make this shift now. This is about sitting down and building your arguments and trying to convince your long-term partner that you're looking at stuff differently. That's a core of the process that I think leads to much better decision-making. And believe it or not, faster than you would on your own. I think faster sometimes on your own, you would not have the pressure to react quickly enough. Yes? You mentioned earlier that your partnerships started based on merit and then became friendship. So could you give some advice or criteria for younger entrepreneurs who are also looking for their co-founders? Yeah. You know, it's, I think it's, I see it as a very important question. And I see here a lot of founders who are looking for a co-founder and asking what's the best way to go around finding the right co-founder. And I believe there's a little bit more art than science to it. It's a, it'd be ridiculous to put together a book that says the steps that you do this in week one, week two, week three, week five, you have a right partner. It's a part of it can be based on your skills and this complementary skills you're looking for. But a lot of it has to do with the right chemistry, sort of the right experiences of each, etc. What I see that helps a lot is when you're looking for people that you respect and you trust. And when that respect comes from having work together in some environment, whether it's that you were in the same company, you were in the same class, you were in different companies about working in a partnership or it was your client or your vendor or what have you. And it started with respect, so that I really respect how the person works or make decisions, etc. That's a really good way to start. And second, when there is that kind of trust where you think, you know what, even in a disagreement and when it comes with concrete examples, not sort of a, when you see yourself disagreeing with someone and say, even if we had to do what she says, I would be okay. Because of that trust that you have, that you wouldn't really care who, you know, if at times it was you calling the shots or at times it was the other person because that kind of confidence you have in that person. And of course it's very, very hard to say all of this at a priori, but when you have that sense or that got feeling with someone, I think that those are good indicators. And very often these decisions are made with a lot less than that, right? And you got to trust, you got to see that there's integrity. You have to, the first thing you have to see in whoever's a person is, if he has integrity to be your partner for a long time and you got to think that it's going to be for a long time and if you're going to go in a boat for three weeks, whatever he's doing or she's doing is. It's what you will be doing if you were using it in there. And sometimes we overlook some of those basic human principles and we just go to some technical expertise, some more specific skills, but I think integrity and motivation are by far the first key ones that you need. And I wouldn't rush. We often see teams that were rushed that they are, someone is very excited with an idea and they need a technical co-founder and whenever someone can write two lines of logo becomes the technical co-founder. It's like rushing, getting married. It's non-trivial and I think there's too much of the success that depends on that. So it's better to wait and suffer all of the consequences of not having the right partner is better than having the wrong partner. Yes. So it wasn't here. As you recruit with Ling, given the marketing conditions, how do you decide if it's good to be persistent and the market will be with us eventually versus being persistent is mostly throwing money down the drain? How do you know what you drop the line? I think that's a great question. I like the previous question. The question is, you know, with the big change that we are doing in Ling, how do we know when you have to be persistent and how do you know that persistent is just throwing money down the drain? The better, I think the question is the less I know the answer but I think it's a really good question because it addresses this issue. I think to be an entrepreneur, you have to have some super strong convictions about what's the need on the market that you are addressing, how technology trends are playing and how they are going to converge with that need that you are supporting, very strong convictions about your product, your customers. But at the same time, you have to have the humility to listen and change. And what do you have a strong conviction about and what do you decide to listen and change? It's a little bit of an art and I wish I knew the answer but I think that's the most important work that we do as entrepreneurs is sort of weaving through that and decide, no, no, look, this is really... We have a strong conviction about this needs to be done this way, no matter what and these things, no, it's obviously not working, we have to change them. In the past, when we look at things that have worked, persistence was always a very, very important factor. We were very close to giving up and we are grateful that we didn't give up. And probably if we were on our own, we would have given up. I would definitely have given up. Maybe Mickey know because he's very stubborn. But it's very hard to say. And these things in perspective become very obvious and easy to talk about. It was obvious that you had to do things that are much closer, like the decision we've been right now, you don't have that kind of certainty. I don't know if it's the right thing or not, it just feels that way and we think that we've been responsible and serious and thorough in looking at the different alternatives but I don't know what the answer is. Yes. I had more personal questions because I know I saw a lot of marketing for playing early on on campus. You made campus, you got to give me a different link tags. I only wanted what's your experience with marketing college campuses because I've heard especially it's Stanford extremely tough to get through students. And what kind of experience do you guys have with that? The question is, what kind of experience do we have marketing to stand for students because you've heard that it's really hard to market in college campuses, particularly in Stanford? So what we've learned is the best way to market to students, it's by students. And here in the crowd we have Lisa and she worked with us, show your hand. She was with us during that process and she's a student, she's finishing her last year now, her last semester. It's amazing what we've learned is that there's nothing you can plan on a whiteboard and all you need to do is to let the same crowd that leaves, breathes. It's around here the whole time to be the ones that design it and let them run, give them creativity, give them the way and just see what happens. We were warned about how hard it is to work to market to Stanford and we were surprised with how well we did compared to that but it was mostly Lisa and her team's work. We knew nothing about what the hurdles were and what the best way to approach this and it worked really well. Yes? With all the buzzer, near-field communications, when do you think tap to pay will become real? And what shifts do you think have to happen for consumers to adopt it? You know, the question is, with all the buzz around NFC near-field communication, what will be the tipping point for consumers to adopt it? I think sometimes focusing too much on the technology is a problem. It's misleading. We have probably a few dozen, thousands of consumers using their phones to pay, tap and pay. We can tell you that the consumer experience works very well across all kinds of ages, socio-economic backgrounds, geographies. It's a lot more intuitive as a gesture and the interaction to tap and to meet and know how much you pay, how much you have left in your account, etc. than the credit card. I see no hurdles from the point of view of the form factor or the gesture, etc. It's more of an issue of the infrastructure. When it will be easy for you to link that to the account you want to pay from when will it be that the merchants have the right infrastructure to accept that. More and more, it looks like a game of very high capital expenditure where very large companies are willing to pay. I can see that once the infrastructure is in place, some opportunities for start-ups to go in between the spaces of the big ones. But the big opportunity of just moving the money seems to be more of a big company. I want to ask the last question. My question is, you guys have been really successful with lots of vegetables. What motivates you now? This is really, really hard work. What is it that motivates you to keep on going to start new companies? You start, don't give it a rough. I don't know. I wish I knew. I think to figure out the answer to that, I should go to the shrink and I'm scared they would fix me, so I won't go. When I was in that sailing trip, I started by thinking that I didn't want to do business anymore. I was tired of business. I grew beard, long hair, got a guitar, put it on a boat and started sailing around the world. I said, I'm never again going back to business. If you are successful in sailing around the world, you start in exactly the same place you started. Pretty much the same thing happened to my thinking. At the time I was done, we were already working with Meeky and starting Gling Nation. But it didn't feel the same. At some point, I realized that very early on, I did this because I didn't have any money and it felt very oppressing and limiting to not so many was a big driver. But now I couldn't say that money is a big driver. For me, I remember being halfway around the world with my wife in India. She was asking questions about the culture and the history and the great things that are to learn about India. I was asking the same people questions about their business and how it was working and the margins and how it could be improved with technology. And realizing that this is something that you do not because you want to and not because you need to but because this comes naturally. This is what you like doing. Creating these things from scratch and then they become something and it's immensely rewarding to work with teams you respect and admire to create things out of nothing. I think very fortunate to be able to do that and it gives me energy. It's some of the same components but I'll give you a very quick story the other day. My daughter lost her first tooth and my mother sent me a letter that I wrote when I lost my first tooth. And my letter said your tooth fairy or it's a mouse actually in South America. Here's my tooth. You know, our currency is very devalued. Could you please pay me in dollars? I'm really out. And I was seven. I think that there is a letter and I couldn't show it to my daughter. I don't know how to strengthen it. I think it's something that it's an energy that wakes you up. Every morning you put your fingers to the plug and you just get sparked when you get up. Having the chance to work to discuss because that's what we mostly do every day. It's something that it's invigorating. Being surrounded by people that you admire. I mean in this room I know a few of you. And just if I had written that someday I would have met some of you at spend time, had read books about people here or just socially we would just blow my mind away. And that's what drives me. It's this aspect that there's a lot to be done and the question every time I see something I'm always trying to figure out what's a business there. And what's going on? I can, you know, everything. I mean in this campus I was working to this building. I was trying to make the mathematics work in my head. But it has to do with that. Is that motivation to really interact with people that you would like to learn more from? We do it ourselves. We do it with the teams that we surround ourselves with. We do it with the people that we want to invest with and go invest with. And it's just something that my wife who's now she's giving up and she just says, let's go ahead. Whatever you say. And it's a lot of fun. I'm sure you'll agree that it's just totally inspiring. Thank you. Thank you.
