 Who you are defines how you build. This is the OddPearle Thought Leader Series. Brought to you by Stanford E Corner. On this special episode, we have Sam Sidel, director of K-12 Strategy and Research at the Stanford D School in conversation with Sycamore, creative director at InnerScope Records. Hosted by Stanford Professor Bob Sutton, Sam and Sycamore talk about mastering the creative process, navigating ambiguity and balancing the tension between creativity and completion. Sycamore and I both come from hip-hop culture and in hip-hop culture we place a premium on freshness, right? Like somebody could say a rhyme one day and it's incredible and it blows everyone's minds and then if someone else comes and says the same rhyme the next day and thinks they're going to get the same reaction and everyone's like that's whack. I heard somebody else already say that. I'm not impressed. Same with graffiti, same with dance moves. The premium has always been on innovation in hip-hop culture and there's also often a competitive spirit to it. So I've studied every interview that you've done at Harvard, at UCLA, rap radar and my goal is to be fresher and get all new content, all new stories, ask different questions and just make it a whole new thing. You know, I kind of sparked a story here at Freshness. It's part of the story on Echo. It's part of the story on, when I was in eighth grade everybody's having a freestyle competition, right? And I probably went to school maybe like three blocks from my house in Brooklyn and maybe like four guys when they did their rhymes, right? So I'm not a rapper. I wasn't back then, I'm not now, but I really wanted to get into it. But I knew rap really well. So I went up and I said I got a verse and I said like this old Buster Rhymes verse that from like an album that like maybe was off for a week but I knew nobody knew. And I said the verse and I said it like double time and then do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do. I went up for like 32 bars and the whole crowd went crazy like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and then like you come to do the old look out that was Randall, that's my government name. That's when it was Randall, that was Randall and after that I was like oh yeah, I want to be in hip-hop. Like this is what I was like the moment I decided like oh this is going to be kind of like my life where I wanted to go because before that I wanted to be in sports. I wanted to be a sports agent. But like it's nothing like hip-hop culture, you know, because you know like it's hip-hop. Everybody has like hip-hop versus rap, you know, rap something you do, hip-hop something that you live. And it's something cool about hip-hop. It's like it's not really about how much money you have. It's really about like where you came from and where you made it too, you know. So it's like if you really started high and you made it even higher, it's not, it's no real clout with that, you know, but if you really came from nothing you made something that's, you could, you could, it's bragging rights in every little part of hip-hop. So let's talk about that piece of flipping something out of nothing which is in some ways like one way you could just define what hip-hop culture is and whatever creative medium, whether it's rap, visual art, entrepreneurship, because it's so related to what creates, what creativity is. And in my book I have a quote from a philosopher named Nelson Goodman and he, somebody asked him can you teach people to be more creative? And he said yes and they said how? And he said give them harder problems. And I've always felt like hip-hop embodies that. And at the same time, Rogatus talks about how like we can't make it seem like you have to be suffering and struggling to be creative. Like there has to be a place for you to be able to eat and be healthy and still be really creative. And it's obvious about how you view that tension within hip-hop culture and within creativity, especially as you work really hard to support artists and make sure they have an abundance and make sure they have all the things they need to be comfortable, but you still want them to have that creative edge. Yeah, I think my main role with artists is like a really help artists finish their projects and get out their albums, get out their films. So in an artist I work with is like YG and Travis Scott, a private of the two examples I'm going to use the most because I work with them the longest, about three albums each and I did a short film of YG, me and Travis have artists together like Shek West. So it's really about protecting their idea because at the beginning of it it always starts with an idea like hey I want to come up with an album about a day in the life in Compton, but I want to do a different in Kendrick. I want to do an album about reclaimed recreating my hometown theme park that was destroyed, but I want to do it musically. And you lock in to this concept for months, years, every single day and my whole role is to get the right people in, keep the process going. That's why I really, that's why the design school, the D school is so interesting to me because it's new ways and new processes of how to do things. And that's all I'm about, especially when you have these new cutting edge artists they want to always find an edge. So one of the things that I always, that's really been hitting home is like spaces. You see? Like right now everybody knows the studio, that's like the basic thing. You go there, you stay there for 12 hours, you record as much as you can and you leave. So there's always tips, there's old school tips about that. Make sure you write before you get to the studio. When you get there, you know, it's the idea for productivity. But the next level of it has been like the home studios. One thing I like about the D school when Bob gave me the tours that you could come in here at 24-7, right? You could come in here at 3 o'clock in the morning. And that's like the best place to make music because if I have an idea to make an album and I have to leave at 12 o'clock and I have to come back the next day, 12 hours later, there's a drive home, I got a full sleep. I got to wake up, I got to go back, I got to get myself in gear, I got to get to the studio, then they got to smoke, then they got to watch some video games, I played 2K. It's a whole process, you know? So if you could just live in the house, like that's the one thing that Travis used to tell me, he said, look, when we first started working together, if I could just, when I lived in one of those entourage kind of places with like two other guys, you know what I mean? It's like if I could just live in a house like yours and I didn't have to leave, I could finish my album, you know? So it was about finding a space, finding a house with different rooms, adding different producers in there, like we got people like a Metro Boomin or FKI and maybe eight or nine producers, like the producer, Olympics, you know? And have them all living in one space that they could always be falling asleep, working, still playing 2K, play still smoking, but still staying in one spot and never having to leave, it's like it's kind of like a heaven for artists. And you can stay there for months at a time until the idea is complete. You get way more productivity out of the situation. And you know, so now, you know, along with Skylar, I've been really obsessed with finding new age spaces and spaces that foster this level of collaboration and creativity. And if you could take this same kind of design thinking and really improve business, to improve design, imagine what you could do for the arts, you know? If you really start taking that and imagine what you could do for your overall projects. It's really interesting because I think design thinking borrows a lot from artists and has turned that into a set of processes and abilities and mindsets that now you're taking back into the art realm and there's like a cycle to it. So with the project like an artist come into you and saying the theme park concept, what is your role in making that a reality? Because it's not just putting anybody in that house. Like you have to be really thoughtful about how you curate who comes into the space, what pieces of inspiration are there, the duration of time, like how the space is set up. Can you just walk us through the process from the point where the artist comes to you and says, I'm thinking this theme park concept might make sense and you feel like that idea is working, like how you take that to the point where I'm picking up the album or streaming or streaming to start to be exposed to the sound. Okay, so the hardest part is like the goal, right? Having the people who, like just knowing what that concept is. About 80, 90% of a lot of creative projects people kind of say, I'm just going to start and kind of figure it out from there. But the project doesn't really start until you have an idea of what you want to do. The name could change, what it looks like at the end could change, but the idea doesn't really change. It kind of like manifests and takes form. And then you have to kind of build a team. So in music, the first thing we have to do is find a solid engineer. The engineer is kind of like an offensive lineman or he's the person who's going to be able to keep track of all the music. Then come up with a laundry list of producers that we want in the studio. And I kind of break it down in the four quarters, football and basketball. The first quarter, there's nothing wrong. It's almost like a two-year-old child. Everything is great. Everything they write in a piece of paper is great. Oh, that's nice. Everything. More ideas. And then you start looking at the first quarter, you start looking back and like, okay, cool. Now I at least have something to play with. Now I have about five, ten, fifteen ideas that are pretty decent and we could really go for. Then the second quarter is exciting because now you have a base. And now you start working on more stuff. You start bringing people in the studio. They start giving you feedback. And you start thinking, oh, you have the greatest album ever. Everything is perfect. Everything is done. And exactly. That's all I feel too. And now you're about half time. And around the third quarter is usually like a song or a moment that happens in the studio that you're like, okay, cool. It's time to finish this up because this is the moment where we got to get this out. Because music especially is about timing. I think about film a lot of it is, I mean, some films are timely, but it's people who can work on a film. You hear stories of people moving around the script for 20 years until it gets marine but the right person and they really nail it. Music is not like that 100% because music is like a collective thought. You ever go to the club, you go to a party and it's like, oh, all these beats sound the same. It's like everyone is listening to the same thing at the same time. So you kind of have to like, time it and it's based on what people are wearing, what kind of alcohol they're drinking, what kind of other substances they're using. That's why in the 16s everything were really psychedelic because everything was based on psychedelics. In the 70s things started moving faster. A lot of that was cocaine. Things started slowing down in the 80s a little bit. Right now the music started getting slower. That's because the opiates, everybody started doing things. I'm not going to allow you to influence the music. It really comes from other things. You mix that with just the different rhythms that are happening and you have the time. If you do a great song, if I put out before I let go, it's an all-time great song, it might not be a big, big song right now because what he's saying at the time, the slang, everything about that moment was from that year. You have to also get the music out in a certain period of time. After you get to that third quarter and you're like, okay, cool. Things are happening. The nights are sharpening up ideas. We start going in an each song. Let's do two more sessions on this one song. Let's do five more sessions on this other song. Let's start locking in this concept. On the fourth quarter is the process. I like to call killing your babies because it's like saying you have an album and you have 20 songs that you absolutely love that you can't live without. We do, it depends on what kind of album you're making. If you're making a linear album, a Kendrick Lamar or a good kid in Mad City, then everything has to kind of fit in the story. If you're making more of a vibe, the album, think like a Drake or a Shade or a future, then you kind of, those albums, you can have more of the same type. But you want to make sure everything kind of fits in that vibe. And things that don't fit, you must have been, you must have loved since the first quarter of the project. It might not fit the overall body of work. So that's so interesting because we talk a lot in the design thinking process about prototyping and failing forward and learning from quick, scrappy, put together, scrappy prototype, see how it plays and then learn from that. Would you say like the leaked track, what are the equivalents of that in your work? The thing that's different, I got an, I had dinner with a guy from an advertising guy, right? And he kept using, he kept trying to take the advertising principles into the music space. And he kept telling, his big example is Starbucks Blonde. He says, you see how Starbucks Blonde is? You could put out blonde and you could market it and it'll blow up and everybody wants blonde. And I was telling him, the difference between blonde and the artist is a blonde, blonde doesn't have a mind, doesn't have a Twitter, it doesn't have, it doesn't have to go outside. So somebody doesn't like blonde, blonde doesn't have hurt feelings. I mean blonde doesn't have any emotions, this is a product. So I think the biggest difference between designing and marketing on product or business versus putting out a real person with feelings and really, real art, whether it be a photographer, musician, clothing designer is, you got people there who really care. And I think that's, some time that gets kind of lost in translation. I also think like, the audience and fans can be kind of unforgiving about what artists do. Like we get really attached to an artist off of one project. And then if they start putting out something that's different in some way that doesn't resonate with us, like I think sometimes the, like especially with social media, like it can be a little hard to like back out of that. I don't know if you've seen that or if you feel like social media has impacted that. But yeah, no, it's 10 times worse. You know, like it's like sports. If you have a bad game now, everyone's tweeting at you, they're adding you, they're getting it, they're putting like Michael Jordan face in Jolomb. Right. And somebody has that four second clip of what you did and like they keep putting memes to it. Yeah, you don't get to escape it. You know what I mean? It happens in real time. So, but the opposite happens in real time. If people like it, you get instant feedback right away. You know, so it works both ways. But it's kind of, it kind of is a price you pay when you want to be a professional artist. You know, if you want to go buy the promenade and play your guitar and have anybody just drop some money in your guitar booth and that's cool. Like, you know, but as soon as you say, you know what? I want you to buy my album. I want you to come pay for my record. I want you to pay for my t-shirt. Now you're a professional. You're a professional artist. You know what I mean? You have to take your seriously and you have to take the pros that comes with the cons and that's the feedback. Now what you're talking about, the success is really the hardest part. Like after you fail, like it's no real expectations. You know, you could go, like we're going to shot the world with this next album or this next project, so people don't really get the response that I want it. But after you have like a hugely successful project, the pressure is like 10 times greater because this thing is like, you might have made this project to like, get back at like your ex boyfriend or you might have made this project to like, because you've been working for like 8 years. But when it's time, after you have success and you toured and you travel the world and people know you for something and then they want you to do the same thing, it gets tough. You know, I think it was Henry Ford. If I missed a quote, it's not Henry Ford, don't kill me. But I think he said, he said, if I gave the people what they wanted, faster horses. They got faster horses. You know, it's the same thing with music. The best example I see in recent time was Kanye West's fourth album with 808 in the heart breaks because he after his first three albums, we have any Kanye fans here? Old Kanye. Congratulations. Well, that's the point. I was talking about graduation because the first three projects, I think Kanye, I was saying the best five album run in hip-hop history. You know, some people could argue, Tribe Called Quest, I wouldn't. Especially the first three albums were perfect. College dropped out, late registration and in graduation. They were almost like massive pieces. And then because the passing of his mother and everything that was going on, he wanted me because everybody was waiting for the album, Good Ashtop, which is supposed to be more in line of Kanye. But he went totally left and made this very ambitious, singing, kind of sad 808 in the heart breaks that was really got mixed reviews at the time. People were really confused. They hit not the people critics were really confused, but they really had a nerve with the people who were actually buying public. And now when you look back, that might be, if not his most influential album, one of the most influential albums. And we wouldn't have a lot of people like Drake and a few other people who just came from that one pocket. Yeah, I give a lot of props to Kate Cutty too, who helped like, curate that sound. But that's an example of somebody taking a major risk on the prime of the career. I look at another old example. It was like David Bowie went to him, bumped into a, who is it guy? Not Justin. It's famous with the guitar player and the first song. It'll come to me. Oh, it's his name, man. He has dreads. He was in the song with that punk. Nile Rogers. He bumped into Nile Rogers in a club in Berlin. And he was like, man, I want you to work on my next album. He's like, why have you heard my music? Why do you want to work with me? And he said, because you make hits. And it takes a strong creative to be able to take a risk after you had success. It's easy to take a risk when nobody knows you. But it's really, really hard to take a risk after you have a certain, any level of success. You can have your Instagram going on. You might not mess up your feed while throwing a different kind of picture as a photographer. Anything you think you throw you off. So you've now worked with artists who have been in this kind of fortunate predicament of having had pretty major success and needing to follow up on it. How do you work with that artist? How do you support them in sort of releasing that pressure and feeling confident to explore new terrain, even while all those eyes are on them? You got to find a concept that you guys can lock in that has nothing to do with just like the commercial success. So if you say, okay, cool, we're going to make this day in the life album. That's going to be good. So I can give you an example of YG, right? So when I started working with YG at Devsham, as is A&R, the big thing was like to make people forget about to it and boot it. Because all success is an equal, especially in art. You can have, I don't know, how many people are here like paint or do photography, do anything besides music? You ever put something out, how have you put it out, give it a gallery or whatever, and the work that you probably spent the least amount of time on got the best response? And like, man, I spent four weeks doing this and you like this. And then people now you have to force to make more stuff in that world. Because maybe you have a gallery and once you do a whole show in that space or you want people more posting there and everything you post is not like that. It's like, it gets less likes or whatever. It's a mind trip. So after the first album, we had a lot of success. We had big hits with my crazy life. But it happened from a great place because it was a concept album. And we really wanted to create this 24 hours in a life inverse of Good Kid Man City. So when we came back with the second album, it was a tough erecture because he had like, he just had a phone out with his core producer DJ Mustard. He got shot in this music studio. So nobody really wanted to keep him in the studio. So we made like this more dark, there's still concept album. But it did well, but it didn't do have the success of the first album. And then after two albums, after that, then we hit like a crossroad. And it's like, you know, like, you like, you know, after this concept stuff, I want to make hits. And then it's kind of like, I mean, Tyler, you are as a creative, you know, because when you shift into that zone, it's hard to kind of shift that, you know, because it's like, all right, if I'm not doing it for like a higher goal, it could get tricky fast. Because then you'll get it hit, but then you'll start losing kind of like the critical stuff. And it's just coming about money and they say if you do stuff for money, God leaves the room, especially creative things. And I really believe that, you know, and so that I was kind of like a tough moment for me trying to like balance somebody's commercial success with the artistic success. And have you found a way to do that? Have you found a way? Because I feel like part of being an AR, for my understanding, is you're constantly in that balance because you've got the label on one side or whoever that's really concerned about completion, that's concerned about budget, that's concerned about all these things. And you're trying to almost protect the artist and really create the space for them to work. So it seems like you're often in that position of having to like hold both realities. I think initially, you know, I went with the belief that if you do your best work and you really put, to put the right hours into it and you have the right intention, you're going to have success. So initially, I used to get in a lot of fights with the label about being over budget or why it's something taken so long or different views of success. But what's happening is if you do things the right way and I have, we'll talk about it later, like have like a seven step process of it, I really believe that you're going to get the right result. It's the second that you start doing things for the wrong reasons, the results go bad. So now recently, with the new artist I'm signing or the new project that I work on, I kind of have like, what happens if you like, if you've been on your creative space and you don't compromise and you have success, it's the best space to be in because then people leave you alone and they kind of overfund you. You know, that's the space you want to be. It's true. It's because it's like, because now it's like, all right, they're looking at it like, they're like, leave Alexa alone, man, she's just going to like, she's got it. You know what I mean? Like a Frank Ocean fan, Frank Ocean fan too. So like Frank Ocean, right? The Frank Ocean doesn't drop out for another six years, right? Would you not listen to it when it comes out? You're like, no, it's going to be the greatest album over this Frank is because that's his process. You know, he gives you these big buys of work and he'll give you like a whole magazine that he shoots himself with the music or Beyonce. I'll give you a whole film and then work on a performance for eight months and then work on the Netflix documentary for a year. I think people really appreciate the time you put into something, you know, and I think like, you got to figure out what kind of space you want to be in. Even when you're in design and you want to do you want to be in like a space where like you're really going for something, you want to be in a space where you have a commercial success. There's nothing wrong with like, fast and furious and there's nothing wrong with Roma. You know what I'm saying? It's like, but you got to, you got to pick one. You got to know what you're doing because if you're like in fast and furious, you're trying to make $250 million, it's good, but just know you're not trying to win like Academy Awards. And if you go to Roma, you know, you're probably not going to feed the family for the rest of your life, but you're going to have your props, you know. And it's cool to pick your space, you know, just just, but just the problem start when fast and furious wants to be wrong. Yeah. Yeah, that's when people start getting it wrong because then the goals are shifted. You can't compromise in each one. Just like, if you're going to do it, just do it. You know what I mean? But don't, don't, don't, you know, they say the horse by committee is a camel. You know, it's like that kind of, that theory. It's the same thing in the creative process. So you were talking about Kanye and what he did with Ada Weitz and Heartbreak. The next album, he did something really different. And I, have you listened to the podcast by sect? So it's, it's the dude who breaks down albums. He actually did Frank Ocean. And he spends a whole season of the podcast just getting into like every track, each episode is one track. And so he did that with my beautiful dark twist of fantasy. And he was talking a lot about how they created that album. Renting this house in Hawaii, bringing all these people in. He had engineers 24, seven and suit and tie just like there in case anybody needed to come in. And he breaks down the Rizza, actually, like there was an interview where he was talking about coming down and being a part of it and the schedule they were on. It kind of reminds me of what you were talking about about your schedule in Atlanta when you were there working on, was that my crazy, my crazy life. But one of the things that Bob was really excited about when we were talking about doing this was understanding like how you build around a particular project, a temporary organization. And like there's all sorts of chemistry that has to go into that of the right people, the right place. Maybe you could walk us through like with a particular project, like how you pulled that together and dismantled it in the effort to produce something that, you know, a really great creative product. I'll do two simultaneously, so I'm not putting two pressures on one. I'll do YG's first album, My Crazy Life, and Travis's last album, Astro World at the same time. Because the same basic principles are both happened, you know. The first thing that was identified is like the concept, you know, I think Travis had a stronger concept with Astro World. He knew he wanted Astro World to be his concept for his third album before his second album came out, you know what I'm saying? So before Burys and the trap came out, he asked Roland's head, so the whole process with that was two and a half years. While YG and I were talking in my favorite song for YG, anybody like YG? Okay, cool. So like my favorite song, YG was a song called Bompton when I met him. I was like, I love this song. He's like, I was like, that's my favorite song, you know, that's my favorite song too. So we decided to create like a concept, a story about like how you can still be hard and do it. But there's always challenges. So the challenge with YG was just the people in the studio. Because you know, like, I don't know how many people from LA, like LA for real. So like anytime we go to the studio, the studio sessions will start like around two or three o'clock, be really productive. Then the homies will start coming in, then five or six o'clock, then feel people coming in, and then everything will start talking about like gang politics and who's shot, who did what, and I was like, yo, you gotta get out of here, man. We gotta go somewhere. So we decided to go to Atlanta because young GZ was there, you know. And what was the young GZ connection? He was executive producing the album and that was already established at that time. Okay. And the label at the time, they felt like YG was like a local artist. They never felt like he'd be bigger than LA. They felt like his, him and my sister sounds were very localized. And they were like, okay, just get the album out. They didn't really, they didn't really want to be the start. Everything has sound, you know, having worked with different New York producers like DJ Premiere and just stuff didn't really make sense. So we went over there and we said we're gonna make the, do the opposite. We're gonna make a super west coast album. And we're gonna lock in here for the whole summer and we went for the whole summer of 2013 and said we're gonna go in a schedule. So we, we are, it was like a job. So for Monday to Thursday, we live in the apartments. I lived in the second floor corporate department, he lived in the fourth floor. We had been in the studio from 6 p.m. to 6 p.m. Then around 12 o'clock, we'd go have lunch. We'd go over the songs we did before. We'd have a white board with the structure, with the songs and what one we're in. Who did what? And we'd go back to the studio. And then from Friday to Sunday, I'd tell him you gotta go live life. Go do shows, go travel, go have something to wrap about. Because if you just lock in in the project every single day after a while, you start losing sight unless you step back a little bit. So like, anybody's telling me like, I haven't, I've been working on this 30 straight days, tell him get the hell out of the house. Because you need to have a more review on things. So that was the process and that was what we committed. And it's really important that you commit to a timeframe. In Scalow, it says, you know, deadlines are your friends. You know what I mean? Like deadlines are important. Because you need to know like, this is going to end. So that was our goal. While Travis is like, okay, cool, we're going to work on this project with unlimited time, but we need to make, we're going to work on this for years, right? And we've been working on this project, we're working on it, we're working on it. Every day in New York and LA and touring and working on this chip and chip and chip in the way until finally it was like time to finish it. And I was like, okay, where are we going to actually go back and focus and finish the album? And that's when, you know, because of my dark, twisted fantasy, you say, you know what? That was made there. So why don't we go to Hawaii? Oh, wow. So it was inspiration off of having seen the process and the kind of temporary structure that Kanye created that brought you all to Hawaii. Yeah. And one of the things between Hawaii and Atlanta, they were both out of the artist's comfort zone because they both lived in LA, went from Houston, went from LA, but we needed to get out chicks, use zones. So that's a very important part of the process is getting out your own space. You know, you got to make yourself a little uncomfortable. And it's got to be its place that's like, it's like, you don't have that much to do. Like Hawaii is nice, right? But it's like, what else can you do? You go to the beach, you could go have a drink of coconut, whatever. And the daiquiri, and it's nothing else to do. You know what I mean? So you might as well work. And the same thing with Atlanta, you could go out, but no one's really up and running it's like 6 p.m. So it's nothing else to do. So you got to give yourself, like, you got to give yourself a place where you're okay, I'm going to lock into a space. Then you got to figure out who you're after you worked on the project for a while and both projects we worked on for a lengthy amount of time, we identify who are strongest collaborators for. So whether it be DJ Mustard or Mike Dean, we're like, okay, cool, let's make a list of people who are going to come out with us, then have them in a schedule. So what happens then is like, and what was the criteria for how you picked who was part of that team? Remember the first two quarters, the first three quarters? Whoever worked with the best in the first three quarters, it's like sports. We're going to put your 18 men for when it's crunch time. You know who's going to fold, who's mid-missing shots, who's going to be there. And sometimes not the people you think it's going to be there, it might be somebody you just met, might be the person locking or you just have one of those moments. So that was like really our criteria. After the first three quarters, we're going to the fourth quarter, who are we going to the fourth quarter with, who are we going to finish this game with, who are we locking in with. So that was really important and kind of going with a goal of what we need to finish, whether it be like the stragglist thing, the structure, the mixing, you know, like all that process. So that's like a big part of that process. And what was your role in like balancing all the personalities and all the, like getting everyone has to do their best at their role and work together really well? Is that like, are you like the coach in that scenario? It's kind of like a coach, you know what I'm saying? And it's like, overall, it's like, the MCL's big movies where you see a lot of big name actors and you're like, no way they got paid full rate for this. The way that they do that, if they know that they're going to be part of a successful film, they'll take less money, they'll take whatever the basic rate is and film is. And they'll go and sign up because they said, okay, cool. This is this is Quentin Tarantino, man. I always want to be part of this film. So especially in art, like when you start coming to people and you start pitching them based on like money, like I can pay you for this, that, that, that, that. Subconsciously, it's like a little bit of a turn off, you know, because people don't really like artists don't really become artists for money. Preset, they need money to continue being artists, but they don't become an artist just because they like, they would become a banker or something that's guaranteed your stock broker or, you know, whatever. So you got to kind of sell people on this project. So when you call them, you have to make the call like, look, man, you know, we're going to Atlanta for two weeks, you know, we really think there's three parts of this film that you're going to be great of. This is the overall concept. You show them that they're a sum of a bigger, bigger parts, like it's a bigger goal and this is how they fit. They're like, cool, sign me up. You know, so like, and then, and then you also want places like destinations like Atlanta, Hawaii, so people really want to go. And when you go, then you pick people, you also have to give them a very clear direction to what you need them for. So you have to pick specialists. Like, if I need you just to play keys, I want you to collaborate. This is going to be your space and it's very important that people have their own spaces to work, you know, and it's also a place that they could come through at the end and like mesh the ideas. So in both places, we would have, in Atlanta, we would have two studios going at the same time with about six, no, three studios going at the same time, two big studios, one small studio, and about three or four communal areas. So people would go disappear and come back. And the best stories I have from it was, one time we put DJ mustard in this really small room, you know, and mustard hates small rooms. He likes big rooms, you know, and he was in a small room and he was mad. He didn't say anything about it, but you can just tell he was like, human a little bit and he's all these other producers were around. He used to be in like, why is he the only producer? So he was just, we didn't hear from him for like, it was one day, we didn't hear from him for like six hours. And then he just walked in the studio one day. He just steps in, we're talking and playing music, he's just cutting the musical off they were working on, drops his laptop, plugs it up, and he plays the beat for who do you love. And it was just like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, and it was, and we were all like, wow, he's still in say word the whole time. And then like I told y'all, and walked out. And then we knew that beat was a hit, but we didn't know what to say on it. So it was about 20 to 30 more sessions just with that one song. It probably took us like four to five sessions. First, his name was called song called Hit a Lick. And I was like, Tory Lane's in the hook and it's like, hit a lick, hit a lick, it's cool. Then why G came up with like, who do you love? I mean, like, okay, this one's gonna stick, but we need something in those open spaces. And we had about 12, 15 more sessions trying to figure out different things in the open spaces to finally say, you know, maybe just leave it open. And that's how it happened. And Drake wanted to be part of that movie too. He was like, oh, I see what you guys are doing. This is going on. So how did he see what you were doing? He just, Drake's like the best A&R in the world. You ever noticed that Drake's always like on the right record at the right time? He has that mind. He's like, okay, cool. This is going on. I'm about to get on this one. But was he like physically there? Like how did he come to know to hear the beat? Because it wasn't out yet. He asked, he was hitting YG up. And he said, you know, somebody he knew from around. He just said, like, hey, what's he working on? He's working on some things. Because another good thing too, when you start doing good work, and it's like collaborative with different people, people start to talk, you know, especially creative people. The people that you try to start to tell you, like, great things are happening. It starts getting around, you know, I mean, the word around the industry, like, oh, they're making this great thing. So I was like, I'm breaking this great album, you're making this great film. And he got in, he just reached out. And he said, can you send me like a couple of options when he sent them two songs and he sent back that song? It was that one. He sent me that in a song called, I just want a party. But he wanted to get on. Who do you love? And like I said, Drake's the best A&R. So he knew which one to get on. Yeah. Yeah. He knows the hits. Do you feel like the energy is different? Like when someone, when folks are working like in a house, the way you were doing in Hawaii or Atlanta versus Drake sending a verse from remotely? It's a little energy because it's more, it's more, it's more, tailor-made to the project because you feel the essence of it. You start being able to say things that you could feel just being there. Like while Drake's first took us over the edge, it was almost like in that kind of like movie that we were speaking about, you know, some of the people just come through like a random cameo at the end. That was like the Drake cameo. But like Tied Dollar's time would be like on three or four songs in a project because he was all the way there. So there's people who are the core of the record and then there's people on the Perfield that you need to kind of like make the whole thing complete. You know, I think with the Travis Rucker, some of the core people were like the sky named Alan Ritter and the engineers and Mike Dean and then some of my like, we're coming like a gunner at the end or some other people coming at the end and just add a little bit of sauce. But it's almost like, you know, you have to be like a director and Travis is an incredible director. So he's like, yo, I need you to rap right here in this part, but I need you to rap like you rap on this particular song and need you to do like this. Okay. So I'm going to do the ultimate director in essence and curate it. How do you handle creative conflict? Creative conflict is good, you know, it's actually what you want because if you're in a space where no one is disagreeing and everybody is having the, everybody is having the similar ideas and there's no conflicting ideas, you're probably not making something great and you probably don't have the right team. The right team kind of like challenges you and pushes you, you know, I think something that Kobe Bryant said once is like anytime the Lakers had a fight in a locker room, they won the championship and anytime they didn't win, that's when everybody was cool. You know, you need some, you need a little bit of angst, you need a little bit of Kevin Durant and Dream on Green fighting. You need, that's kind of the mustard laptop story. Like kind of you need a little mustard laptop. You need, you need, so do you purposely cultivate like, like, did you put him in the small room because you knew it was going to like, no, no, no, no, no. It kind of happens to self because everybody has egos, you know, so like, and then which my job is to make sure everybody sees the higher purpose. You can't let anybody's ego win. So I do a lot of time like taking people to the side, talking to them about stuff, I'm what their role is, why they're here, so on and so forth. And those common things are never really about money. It's about time and space and not getting enough time and the thing, you know, so it's like creating a flow. So it's about having a place where everybody could come, drop their stuff and do it and it doesn't happen right away. What happens after, you know, like, 34th quarter, that's when the flow really starts happening in the third quarter. You start seeing some signs that are happening early, but the magic really starts happening in that third quarter. So many things are important, like, these schools having like collaborative space. I walked upstairs and I saw like there were white boys everywhere, but nothing was like closed, you know what I mean? Like you could go in almost anybody's room, me and Bob just ran into some of the people who had a conference call going on. He was just running. We went to the rest of the Harlem, but you know, it's cool, he was really cool about it and it was like, you need spaces like this so you can always drop them because you know, when you have, especially when you have a fresh idea, you want to be able to just tell somebody right now, you're like, look, so what it is, especially while you're excited about it, so the ideas can like mate and become like bigger ideas. So you need that kind of collaboration. And you also need, again, you really need a time frame because when people, I need a time frame for multiple reasons, but you haven't noticed like, you ever hear stories like, oh, the last song in the album was the biggest song and it's not a coincidence, it's because when you're close to the end of a project and you're finishing up a show for a gallery or you're finishing up, anything that you're doing, any kind of creative project, you know what you're missing at the end. And so you go back with an extreme focus at the end of the fourth quarter that you didn't have at the beginning of the first quarter. You know, you're like, okay, I really need a up tempo song about my mom or something. I need something, I need a picture here that's full color and wood framing. I need this on this spot. So at the end of the project, you're always going to know exactly what you need. And usually when you're going with that level of focus, it could be your biggest work. So that's interesting because I often think that when you get down to that point in the creative process, it's almost like a Rubik's cube. Sometimes you work yourself into a corner where you've got all the other pieces where you want them and then finding that perfect last piece can be almost the most challenging. Because every time you try to move to get to it, you're messing something else up. But at least you have four sides done. You know what I'm saying? It's like the first, when you first have that Rubik's cube, it's like, oh shit. You know what I mean? You're just doing this for days. You know what I mean? So when you got to that last part, at least you know the end is there and then you have a laser-like focus to get those last greens. You know what I mean? You're not going to move from that point. It's easy to put the Rubik's cube down when you only have like a half a side. Have you ever had a project that got to the third quarter and then it just, it didn't make it? I don't have that project. I think so. And there's two projects in particular. I won't put the names out there, but I'll tell you both of them. One didn't make it because they didn't see it all the way through. At the end I'm just leaking the whole thing as a mix tape so I didn't have the real promotion. You know, it's like why work on this film? I like to compare it to films a lot because it's just a complete idea. Like why work on this film just to like leak it online? So like, I don't know, line wire. Wherever you download movies right now. You know, that was really frustrating. And the second one was where I got that example of like a dope, this singer from Chicago. We had, we had, we pretty much had the album finished. And at the end he didn't want to shoot the video. He didn't want to do anything and he put the album out like a year later, pretty much in his entirety, but two songs. We eat the same artwork and everything. So the trick with the difference between films and movies is, I mean films and music is if you don't put something out for a year, a lot of the ideas you had are out. You know what I mean? They're out in the universe. So he had a point where he was the leading person in music and R&B. And then everybody started like taking a little piece and taking a little piece. So by the time he put it out, he wasn't like an original anymore. He even though he had the music ready. That's why I say timing's tough. And the hardest part for an artist to do is somebody to be like, okay cool. It's time to finish. You know what I mean? It's time to press send. It's time to let it go. That's really the, that's the toughest part of artistry. You know, and if you can convince somebody to do that, that somebody could be like, you this is out and you're a producer. So we're going to open it up for Q&A from the audience in a minute. But you've been working on sort of a formula for creative process or creative confidence. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's the next slide in the right there. And I'd love for you to share with everyone, including myself, like how this formula works. And if possible to kind of attach it to a particular creative process. And one thing that we haven't really spoken on is, like you're, we've talked a lot about your work as an A&R, but we haven't actually talked about your previous life as a mixtape DJ or your current sort of other life as a photographer or any of your other creative endeavors. So feel free to connect it not just to, I mean, you absolutely connected to music projects, but if there's other creative endeavors that illustrate it, please bring those into. All right. Are you really excited about this? I'm going to stand up. All right. All right. So I'm working on this concept for about two years now. And basically, like, I feel like anyone could be creative, like anyone could be healthy. Like a lot of times, you know, to be healthy is really hard to eat in veggies. So working out, so I'm watching the carbs, counting macros, you know what I mean? It's like, it's a process. And I think it's the same thing with creativity. And a lot of times I meet people and they say, like, look, I'm not creative. I'm not a creative person. Creativity is not. I mean, I don't believe that I just feel like people that think the problem with creativity is no process for it. Like in school, it's easy. Like, you know, I work hard. I take my honest classes, I do an application, I get into Stanford, 120 credits, I get my GP up, I graduate, you know, I could go to a master's grad school, it's a system. It's an easy system you put in here. You go to the army, you start as a private, a general, you can move your way up, corporate America, same thing. So I'm an intern, assistant, manager, director, senior director, vice president, senior vice president, executive vice president, president, CEO, you know, you work in sports, you know, high school, JV, varsity, I make the team, college, get drafted, MBA, 82 games, pre-season, MBA games, 47, 47, 47, 47, 47, I'm a champion, right? It's like, it's an easy process, but being a creative, it's not like that. No one can tell me my step-by-step process of how to be like an incredible artist, you know, and that's the tough part. So what I try to do here is show people a way that you can structure yourself. So I think we talked about it a lot, Sam, is a goal, right? And you need like a big goal that's going to wake you out of bed. It can't be something small, it has to be something that's huge. And I know everybody, I'll see some people with paper. So if you have like a piece of paper, like just right now, like what's your biggest creative goal is, you know, it could be like, to win a Grammy, to like, do a tour, to do a gallery show, an international gallery show, it's like, whatever your biggest goal is, just write it down. It's really for yourself, you know what I mean? I just want to show something. And the second thing is the intention behind your goal, you know, everything is done with intention, you know, and I think like, why do you want this? You know, and usually if that goal has something to do with money, you're probably not going to get there, you know, because the money comes in different ways and fasts and sometimes, you know, and then what happens is like, do you not care about the goal anymore? You know, it's weird, it's weird, the art and money, it seems like it's there, but it's not. It's like, it has a magnetic pull that doesn't really attract it. But if you don't chase the money, chase the art, you can get more money ever. So try to keep your intent away from your actual goal and what's your intention? It could be because you want to put your hometown on, it could be, you know, you want to make your parents proud, you know, I have, I'm trying to sign this artist right now whose dad was his dad was a singer or used to be a singer in a huge band for like the 70s and 80s. But he wasn't the original singer, he was like, you know, when they replaced the lead singer, like after the prime, so he used to get treated bad, so the artist came in and he was like, he wants to be in the next level, he wants to be better than his dad. That's like serious intention, you know, maybe because there's a lot of things that they play there. It's like family, it's like goals, you know, you need, these people have some real motivations out here of people who are training for this and because you don't get medals along the way, it's harder to stick with it. Especially society, when you're a kid, it's easy, like remember when we're talking about the fridge, like, oh everything's nice, everything goes in the fridge. By the time you're like 14, 15, 16, stuff stops going on the fridge, you know, they're like, hey, did you apply for that college yet? Did you get a job? How's that internship going? Like people, the conversations change and you know, when you start getting into your 20s and you know, people start looking at your goals like that, your artistic goals. So it's really going to come down to you and that comes down to the third part as you sacrifice, what are you willing to give up to get the goal? Is anybody here not from California? Okay, so everybody here knows what, that's the sacrifice. You know, you could have went to your homeschool, you know, you could have been, it wasn't a lot easier to go to your state school, you know, to the school in local city, but you wanted to get the hell out of there. You know, I mean, you wanted to make it sacrifice and come here to one of the hardest institutions in the world to make it in and that's a huge sacrifice and sometimes it's about traveling, you know, are you saying the story about the guy who took a first class flight? Yeah, who was it you told? I was, I think it was in this book, Deep Work, that my colleague here, Lara gave me that he was talking about how hard it is to focus with social media and everything and you may know who this is about. He was an executive somewhere, but he booked himself a first, a business class seat to China and back just to be somewhere where he couldn't have cell phone or internet and to write his book and that was his way of like hacking the world we live in now to have the creative space and the focus to do that Deep Work. Yeah, that's like a sacrifice, like going to Atlanta, going to Hawaii, separating stuff. I remember my interview Travis for the Grammys or something and I asked him this question, like what was your biggest sacrifice through the whole process of making an album and he was like, you know, not seeing my newborn baby, like I had a newborn at home and like I never really had to, I go home 11, 12 o'clock and I have a big sacrifice and I'm with him every day and I'm like, man, I don't even think about this, you know what I mean? I don't think about like, you know, it's a lot of times having a newborn is like the biggest thing in somebody's life. They shut down, they go home and turn and leave and he's in the studio every day, you know, and I said, so you gotta figure out what you're willing to sacrifice and what we're saying before is the faith, like you know, when the stuff stops going on the fridge and people don't like the pictures, the soundcloud's not going crazy, like, and you got it, you need a faith that's kind of like bigger than yourself because that's the part when most people quit, you know, because enough people kind of like, stab it to the worst. I remember when the worst feelings I had was when I remember one time I went home and went to like a real dark rut in school, not school like in music and it wasn't going well, it's before older, good stuff started happening. It was between when I was like, it mixed tapes and before like the wise, yeah, I had like a four year gap there where it was real shaky for me. My mom was like, hey man, you should get like a job or did I, you know, and it's like, it's one thing when like the rest of the world says when your parents say something to you, it's like a whole another level of like shaking belief, you know, so you gotta like really find out what your faith is and what really gives you your faith, you know, whether it be like religion, whether it be like meditation, whether it be a family member, sometimes it's like one person, happens to sports a lot. You got one person who's just really believes and really pushed like really lean on that person to get in faith because everyone's faith gets tested and the only way you're going to really get there is if you're able to shake past that moment. And then after you get the goal, you have the right intent, you made the sacrifice, you getting your faith from somewhere, that's when you start to get in the flow. And before you get in the flow, you need a routine. The best book that I see about routine is the power of habit, you know, so if anybody hasn't read that or need that, it's a great book on how to build a routine. And building a routine that all the stories I was telling was really about the same thing was like going to the same spot every day, going to the same goal, doing it over and over. Because it's not going to happen in the first few weeks, maybe even the first month you start. But after like the first month or two, then the magic starts happening, you start staying in the D school for a long time. Then it's like after six weeks like, oh now we're really kicking the gas and that's when all the serendipitous moments start to happen and things start to really cook, you know, so that's when the flow hits. And after the flow hits, that's when the magic starts to happen and you really make that work, you really have that breakthrough moment, you know, you're probably the label quality who wants to sign you, you start getting your first gallery show, you get representation and like that's kind of like the magic. And you kind of, the problem with the magic step, because when I first started it, so I only had five steps. I didn't have faith and I didn't have legend. I didn't want to do this at Harvard, only had five. See, you got seven here. And I came up with legend because I realized that the magic's like driving like a, I was like a, those fast cars, the F1, like a F1 car, like formula car. You know, it takes a long time to be able to learn how to drive it. But the second you start thinking, not doing everything you're supposed to in a car and taking the odds with the wheel and showing off the second you crash. And that's like being in the magic, that's being like in that quantum field. When everything starts happening, you can't take it for granted, because you got there from steps one through six. So that's when most people go bad, you know, I was using the example like Tiger Woods, because they usually when, usually when it stops, when you break out of this, doesn't end good, it ends bad. Like for Tiger, it ended with like his wife chasing him out of the house with a golf club. You know, because he started taking steps one through six for granted, you start forgetting the goal, you start forgetting the, why you did it, you start forgetting the sacrifice you put in and start losing your faith, you know, you're not doing the routine anymore. And it takes so long to get back to the magic that sometimes you never get back there. And you live your whole life thinking about those moments when you had it and you had to stay locked in and you didn't. So you had it from moment, that's why you see a lot of one hit one there, that's why you see a lot of people who have to do one great body of work and they don't know how to do it again because they're not willing to go through the hard steps, it takes to go through one step to one through six. So let's say you do everything, you do steps one through six, and then you do it again for another project, you can do it again for another project, and you do it again. So I got a timeline on this and on me and Sam, this deer's agree on the step a little bit. I think after about 10 years of consistently doing something, that's when you can start talking about the legend stuff. And I think like, I was using an example of sports, I love sports, I was like as you can see. And it's like Paul Pierce, he's placed for the Boston Celtics, he gets in a lot of trouble talking about if he's better than doing away to whatever. And Paul Pierce is a really good player and he probably had like eight NBA all stars, he might make the Hall of Fame, but he's not like a legend, like doing away is like a legend. You know what I mean? He's somebody who's like all the time, like Kobe's like a legend, like Jay-Z's like a legend. You know? Some people are getting there, like I feel like I love Taiman Paula, but they probably got like five more years before they become like legendary. So it becomes like a consistency that you have to hit over and over. So I give it about 10 years, or maybe like five projects on a big scale, before you like an absolute legend, you can do it over and over. And legend doesn't just mean commercial success, it just, it can mean like, it's like kind of like, what's that, uh, searching for a chicken man? You ever seen that documentary? We've seen that one. Yeah, so I didn't see it, I just know the concept of it. But the concept is, he's in Africa, right? Where is he? I think he's in like, so the story is this guy, he's making this music somewhere and then he comes to Lesbian, everybody wants to go there and try to find him and like, or something, somebody could be in your neighborhood who has been doing it for a long time. And the consistency for doing it for a long time is what takes you over the top. So that's kind of like the seven steps that I've put together. I'm really, really happy with the seven steps. And I think that anyone, if you follow these seven steps, you can really take your creative goals to the next level and you can use this as like a check mark for your creative goals. You can't use it for everything, in my opinion, but definitely for any kind of creative project. Let me sit back down for a second. Thank you. So we can do this forever and we were doing it last night and this morning and we'll keep doing it. But we only have a few minutes with you all here, so I'm going to stop being selfish and open it up. And I think Bob is going to help us a bit with the Q&A. Yeah, let me, let's say, so I thought that the person we should start with asks the first question is Skyler because he's like an insider. So after hearing all this, what's your question? I'm curious, so the Faith Parts knew. I'm curious a little bit where that came from and also in line with Faith, how do you sort of measure your progress along the way with something as ambiguous as a creative project? So the first part, the Faith Part happened actually, happened here in the Bay. I was working on this project with Skyler actually and I was raising money for something, for like this new project. And the day of the project, like it had this big meaning right here in San Francisco, everything started going bad. First, like the big talent of the project said they can make it, they were going to make it. And everyone had to fly that, I said. And the second thing that happened was the manager went to the airport and it's like got canceled and can't get on because it's a bad thunderstorm. And Skyler was supposed to come and hit fly use stuck in the airport for like eight hours. So I got was the only person who made it. And it was pretty bad. I was just like, alright, I'm just going to go by myself. So I went there early, I met with the people and told them like, I'm the only one who made it. They were pissed. They were like, where's everybody out here? You should've told them to do that. So I had to sat there in the meeting. The meeting was supposed to look like this. It probably just like the first row. Because everybody didn't show up. But I sat there and I still did the presentation. And I felt really good about it. And I still have a really good relationship with the people up to this day. And when I went home that night and I was like, you know what, I'm on the right path. I'm supposed to do this. I'm not going to let this kind of shake me. And I want to make sure this goes all the way. And then I'm working up really well from there. And I was like, oh, this was a lesson. Like God kind of put me, the universe put me in that as a lesson that you have to have faith. And I really have faith in yourself when everything's going wrong. And that's kind of like the moment when I realized. And when I started talking more people about it, I realized how much faith plays a factor and so much success. Because it wasn't for faith. And most people wouldn't be here. Most of what's going to be in this room right now, if it wasn't just had faith. You know, a lot of people probably told you, you probably never get into the school. You can't afford it. Or you can't get into this program or whatever. Like, you know, once you made it here and you made it here mostly, mostly your faith. And maybe faith in you, the faith in your family, faith in your friends. And that's how the faith in me came out. All right. Another question? All right. Oh, we're up there. There's one all the way in the back. Okay. I've got the one in the front alley. You get the one in the back. Wait. Oh, wait. Yes. Hi, sorry. I'm kind of losing my voice. But my question was, so I know in record labels, I used to work at one. And it's like, there's the artist facing people and the kind of like consumer facing people. How do you make sure when you're working in the framework of a record label, if you want to be like working with the artist and really serving the artist's interests? Like, how do you navigate that in the space of that organizational structure? I believe, when my mentor, he always taught me to believe that record labels work for the artists. That's their customer. No matter what the record label tells you. And I believe that, you know, the thing you're booking studio time, you're marking them, you're promoting them, they kind of flipped it to make you think like the artist works for the record label. But it's not the purest record labels supposed to work for you. It's supposed to be a service base. And I think that's more where it's going. And that's where you see more aggressive deals where artists will be coming more partners with the labels versus be like, I'm signed to this. You know, there's certain smaller labels to a more incubator to do more things like the classic like Motowns or like the current like TDE's or Excel recordings who do more a sense of artist development. But I, I'm saying she's requesting more artist base. And I really fight for my whole organization to be more artist based. You know, like I had, I was getting into something with somebody who worked under me like a junior A&R. And she was like checking out at the project because she felt like the artist wasn't listening to her ideas. And I was like, well, she doesn't have to. You know, you're supposed to listen to her ideas and you're supposed to just help build on her ideas. Like, she doesn't work for you. You know what I mean? We're trying to help her get out. Her thing. So I think it should be, I think the best labels are artist driven. And because the artists really work from kind of like the fans. You know, that's their checks and balances. They have to go on Twitter and they have to get the feedback. They're putting out the risk. Nobody cares that in the scope of the album. They care that Kendrick Lamar or Lady Gaga put out the album. They're the ones with their name facing in there, the ones with risk itself. I feel like the record label is work for the artist. That's their customer. I asked one question. One thing that you said repeatedly in multiple ways, the best was that when people start talking about money, God leaves the room. Yeah, I got that from Quincy Jones. So, well, so, it was a really rich guy, by the way, right? So, it's an ambivalence or a duality. So, how do you deal with that? When I say God leaves the room is when you start making the art thinking like this is going to go financially, like I'm going to make this song because it's going to do well on the charts. First is like I'm going to make this song because people are going to love it. Like I'm going to make this song without like a function. Like if I'm going to make this song because I think people are really going to dance, slow dance to this one. That's like a real intention. I'm going to make this song because I think it's going to make me a million dollars. It's probably not going to be a good song. And you could always identify the songs and the album that are like the straight shots that people are taking the risk. They usually don't fit in the rest of the body of work or, you know, it's something that like the galarist tells somebody like, you know what's really hot right now? Like, I don't know. What's like a hot thing in art? You know, like it could be flowers. They have to move more flowers. People love flowers. That's the thing that they sell. So like, and it doesn't sell like, man, I listen to this guy, but it's not his art. So that's what I mean about the money. You need money for booking studio. You need money to do shows. Arts get paid, obviously. I'm talking about the intention of the actual pieces of work. So that's it. So we had in our class on Monday, our visitor was Ed Catmill, who's brand Pixar, started Pixar. And hardly talked about money at all. And just kept arguing qualities the best business plan. It was just, because funny, we served this from you, almost exact same sort of thing. So that's cool. Is it true? It's a factor. Hi, my name is Demarkis. Excuse me. And streaming is definitely like contributing to, I think, artists' ability to put out art just almost instantaneously. But with that being said, I think it's contributing a lot to just the number of art or the amount of art that is out there. So how do you think that longevity looks for the industry today? Because now people are becoming more forgettable or art is becoming more forgettable just because they share a amount that we receive on the daily basis. Do you mean how the long term in the business side is at our art part? I feel like now they kind of go hand-to-hand, like in order to be an artist with longevity, you kind of have to be a business man or woman. Or yeah, so it doesn't make sense. Like how, basically how do you create art at art that lasts if that being the most honest that you can be or is it, I don't know, basically that's my question. I'm a firm believer in putting out the best art that's closest to you because then you could always build a real fan base from there. It is better to have a small, strong fan base than to have a fan base that you get overnight that might not be there. Like, what's the guy, little ex-naz? I knew you would think of Old Town Road. Yeah, I'm sure he's a good guy. Anybody like fans of him though, like as an artist, it's tough to be too because it happens so quick for him. He went to the top so fast that I build like a strong core fan base. So now everybody knows who he is or they know his song, but he doesn't have a core. And because of streaming, because of the narrative, he blew him up. But now he's going to have a really tough time not being like the Old Town Road guy. You know, and having to build a thing. So that's why it's better to kind of like build your fan base. You almost don't want your first project, your first song to be successful because it will haunt you for a long time. I remember I always see Trinidad James and you know, he's doing good now. He's like a songwriter. I think he might have won a Grammy right last year writing something. But his first mixtape had like nine songs. It was like his first nine songs that he created. And one of them is all gold, everything. And it was tough for him to ever live that down. So it's better to like have a strong base that you can build for time. And if something hits is cool, but you always have your base versus like something going really fast. And you know, like David Feldquo, you know, it's, it's a, it's what he said about famous first and infamous. He's like, no one you can't get unfamous. You just get infamous, you know. It's like, it's like, oh, he said that. That little ex-knowledge you name again. What are you doing, Macyl? You don't want to be like that. You rather be somebody who's consistently doing things for a long time. So I think in a sense of streaming, streaming kind of hurts. This is my argument against the art of streaming. I think it gives people, people don't commit as much anymore. Everything is kind of like, oh, this is the project. Oh, I just worked on this. They keep giving themselves a creative out. Because it's so easy to upload. So you get a lower quality of music. Not because of the platform. It's because of people kind of cheat themselves. No one commits it says, no, I put my all behind this album. You know, because he just uploaded really quick. So they're cheaping themselves in the art. So that's what I don't like about streaming. I love that anyone can put out music from anywhere. You know, Skyler put me on to like the out-sheet movement and Legos. And I think that's an incredible movement. But they're very committed. They don't take half steps. You know, I don't like the people who just, they come and talk to me about the music. And they're like, well, you know, this is a project. But I just, forth and this for a week. And you kind of like it. So if you like it cool, but if you don't like it, you know, I don't like that. I like people who like, no, this is it. I worked my life into this. Hands up. All right. How do you know when a project is done? I heard Ken Jigs say this once and I kind of go with this. The exact quote was, I know my album is finished when I start fucking with shit that don't need to be fucked with it. Which means like if you start, at some point you're going to start messing it up. If you keep playing with it. You know what I'm saying? So like, you just got to let it go. Because you'll start ruining and overproducing. You know? I get the hand up here. But it's interesting when I work with PhD students when they start going back to the same problem over and over again. And it's not going to be better. They're just making the same mistakes. It's time to ship. There's a hand here. Oh yeah. Hi. So I recently watched the, the Defiant ones, which is a really great Dr. Dre and Jimmy IV documentary on Netflix. I don't know if you've seen it. Sorry. So basically the documentary kind of follows their individual journeys and then talks about how they kind of came together to the beats and Apple merger, which obviously was like a monumental event in hip hop and in tech. But there's a really interesting quote that Jimmy IV says, which is a culture and product co-evolve. And he also goes to say that you can't spend any amount of money to create culture. And in that, it's brought to product. So first, I guess I want to ask you if you believe that. And secondly, if so, how has our current culture and kind of our generation impacted the products that you create now? So the question was how, he said the question again. This is a question. You can't culture and product co-evolve and you can't spend any amount of money to create culture, right? So in terms of how you create your own product, how has our current generation and the values and things that are going on in this world right now, how does that impact the product that you make? How does culture complement the product that you make? I'm learning a lot about design thinking. I'm building up a new venture and I've been studying a lot versus product versus business and business models. The best thing I've read about it so far is I've learned about OS. You know what I mean? And how you build OS and build a business model later in the product later if you have the right concepts. So something like Travis and these sneakers, right? If I get one more phone call about people hitting me about these sneakers, I'm just going to change my phone number. And it's like, but the good thing about it is he did something great in one space and you kind of know what his OS is. So it translates into shoes or shoes sell and that's how you sell the product. Or Dr. Dre has such a quality for music that it kind of translates into his headphones. He's like, okay, cool. This makes sense. It's his headphones. It's not really about the sneakers or it's not really about the headphones or really about what that person and what they represent in their music and the level of quality they put in there. You know? So I still think it comes down to nothing really happens until you make that quality and your true to yourself. And then you can kind of like sell anything you want after it. But you need to still get that core, that core creative down first. And you need to get that out first before even think about product. So I agree, you can't buy culture, but you can't create culture, but it's just very hard. You know, it's not a dollar amount that creates culture. You got somebody in the back there? Oh. Emily. Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about your process for creating the visual aspects of an album. So like the album cover the music video. What goes into that? Well, you kind of got the concept of the album and you kind of went everything to match. So after you know the idea, if you're doing like 24 hours in a day, or you're doing asher world, or you're like a Shex album is called My Boy, you know? Then you have to find the best creators in that space who really understand. The best way to do it is to get people involved before the project is finished, you know? Like so they can feel a part of it. So you kind of be creating it with them. You know, Travis brought in. Now, why is the name blanking in the photographer? Right. Mm-hmm. Like a spider? No, the big one. David Lashepel. Yeah. And he came to the studio and he listened to the album, he heard the concept and he came up with that inflatable head concept. So we had that concept before the album came out and worked on that cover simultaneously while working on the album. So that's something like you really want to get different creatives and partners in earlier rather than later for your process. You know? Especially like, and everybody needs partners, you know? So if you're doing a photography show, you might want to get the frame involved early. So you know what? Photos you're going to pick that's going to match the frames. You know? If you're not thinking about that and you wait till the end, you might change the whole line up. If you want to change, you're like, yeah, I want to make a photographer in and get everybody in. The best thing to do is get people in on the ground floor, especially in that fourth quarter. So you don't want them in too early because it's not the idea hasn't formed enough. But if you get them in on the fourth quarter and you get the other creatives, but before it's finished, that's probably like the magic sweet spot to get the other creatives in early. But do you want to start expanding your team around the fourth quarter? So Alex, I'm going to get to you next, but I have an interesting, because you keep talking about this, the time rhythm and the fourth quarter in particular. And since a lot of your job is to keep things on track, what's the sign to you? You're in the fourth quarter and things aren't going right and you got to do something. It's when they rush to finish line, you know, it's everything's like, okay, now it's done. You know what I mean? It's just like, you can't just cheat. I don't want to just put stuff out. It's all about presentation. I had a mentor who always just teach me that. He said, you know what's the problem with your generation? It's no presentation. You know what I'm saying? That was his big thing. He's right. You know, everybody wants to just put a sound cloud link. Like, we talked about a lot of good things about Kanye. One of the things I really hated was his roll out for his last album, yay. You know, he's like, I made this art on the way to the party and that's like the stuff that I hate about just doing right now stuff. You know what I mean? It's like a cheat code. You didn't want to work that hard. You know what I mean? You're in the fourth quarter. It's supposed to be tight. It's supposed to be aggressive. It's supposed to be ID. It's supposed to be bouncing. It's supposed to be really well thought through. You can't rush that process. Why I work so hard for three and a half quarters just to rush it for the last six minutes. It doesn't make sense. You see that in your model. If you want to start skipping stuff, you're in trouble. Yeah. You can't take any part out of here. The whole thing in crumble. So you speak a lot about timing and it has me curious about your approach to creating something that's relevant to the time, but that can also last and that can also work to push culture, push the current movement. Timing is important because the deadline is important because you want to put a little bit of pressure. You don't want to have no pressure on the creative because you'll never come out without them. You'll never come out with a project. You'll never do the gallery show. You'll keep playing it off. So having a deadline is nice because it gives you, you need a little bit of that frantic energy to kind of close it. I think it's called Parkinson's Law. It's the amount of time you have to complete a set task as the amount of time it'll take to complete the task. This hands to like, if you had two weeks to finish a project at school and you're going to cram the night before because it's due tomorrow, it's the same thing with a creative process. You know, like you know, if you know you have to put it out this date, you got that pressure. So sometimes it's good to have, but remember as a creative, it's not like school, it's a self-imposed pressure. So you have to give yourself your own deadline and stick yourself to it. So I think deadline's work for a reason. You know, deadline's work in all aspects of life. And if you take deadlines out of creativity, you just get lofty dreams and you never get results. But also in terms of the sound, I don't think it's wise to go completely against the grain and what's throw that at the top. So how far is too far in terms of going to look at the next problem? You all hear the question. So it was like, how do you know how to not go too far ahead of what the current sound is, right? Like to push the edges of it without going so far to the bleeding edge that you fall off. That kind of... It depends on the goal. You know, it depends. You know, I have this talk in the studio about their alleges and their originals. And most of the time they're not the same person. And a lot of times to be an original, you have to sacrifice commercial success. There's a lot of people like how I use the example of like Kanye's all-time legend. But I think future generations are going to have to really study K-Kuddy. But Kuddy now is a little bigger than he was when he first came out because of his influence because he's more of an original. You know, even though he's not as big as Kanye who is a legend. But I don't think Kanye is actual. I think Ferrell is more of an original. You know, he makes an original sound. He makes an original thing, it's original thinking. So the answer to your question is really about your goal and the way you want to end up in life and what you're happy with. Some artists are very happy with just saying, you know what? I did an uncompromising body of work. And if they didn't get it right now, I get it. And my happiness is that I completed the idea that I know I could accomplish. And that's cool. You know what I mean? And you'll inspire them. Figinality versus commercial. Like what hard to spectrum do you want to be in a hard, do you want to work? And what your goals are? You know, it's just, there's no right answer. It's just where you want to end up. It's that fast and furious Roma space. Thanks. Robert. So on Monday in our class with Ed Katmout, he explained that Pixar has a 2-to-1 rule. Where to stay creative. They introduce two new creative films for everyone's sequel. They do it to a financially successful one. I was curious since you're at a point now where it may be easier to work with artists that you've worked with in the past to have been creatively or financially successful. How do you think about taking risk on newer artists without a proven track record? I decided my spate. I decided I'm not all the way Roma. You know what I mean? I'm maybe like one step here. I like having commercial success that also is really like kind of big and cool. You know what I mean? I like going here and like music playing out of cars. People hit me up for concert tickets. I like being relevant. But I also don't want to work on a Taylor Swift album. You know what I mean? Because it's like I just wouldn't do anything for me even if sales 10 million records. It's not the space I want to be in. I don't want to be a part of it. It's not the commercial success that's in many things for me. For you, it's like figure out where you want to be and kind of stay there. You know what I'm saying? Pixar is kind of close to here. Because even the movies that are not like super like critical are still pretty dope. You know what I mean? They never really end up over here at all. They're kind of like in this range right here. So it's just kind of figure out a year, sweet spot, what you're excited for. Like I really want to, I look at people like a no ID or a Rick Rubin. I like that space that they're in. You know I want to be able to put out projects that people really love or change their life or was really inspirational. So for me, I have to work on projects for a longer period of time. You know, like I have off years. Like I might not put out a project this year that's going to be huge. You know, and I have to be cool with that. You know what I mean? Because I know like next year or the year after I'm going to put out something that's going to be amazing. You know, so you've got to just be, the hard part is being comfortable during the dead time and locking into your idea when everything is going on around you. So if you work on one project for two, two and a half years, three years, it's kind of scary because all these other things are going on. You're still locked in this one concept. What is the most conscious? What is my concept getting old? What if it's getting still? What if the concept doesn't really work by the time it comes out? Are the people really going to get it? And I'm not really getting the feedback from what I'm working on. That's like the hardest place to be knowing that you could absolutely fail. And that's where the faith comes in, you know? So we're about to, so Sam, I think you should wrap it up. Great. He's even raised my hand all the time. We have one question here. One more. And I do have a last question. So we'll do these two and that'll be it. All right. You're going to find the work. Nice shape, I think. Thank you. I found this shirt and I was like dang, I really need the shirt. But I was thinking a lot about how Starbucks Blonde hasn't had feelings and how people, especially artists, have a lot of feelings. And I want to know, just like what kind of emotional fortitude doesn't artists need to build up, either that in themselves or their teams to be able to face all aspects of social media being very fast and responsive and cancel culture being something that people fear a lot. And another question is how do female artists deal with that when maybe they have less space to have a voice in the first place and if they do, I mean, this is in context of maybe the prerequisite for female artists to make it being that they have to be quite hypersexualized in order to be successful. How do, how does, these are all very broad thoughts, but I just want to hear. What you want to say? I think for the first part is, I think a lot of the great people kind of put blinders on during that third and fourth quarter of their project is probably not, at some point you need inspiration and then the number one thing that taps inspiration, not gives inspiration also takes away your phone because you're like, oh, I'm really researching all these great things. I was like, ooh, look, it's a cat. You know what I mean? It's a whole, we're in the center in place where people spend billions of dollars every year to distract you. You know what I mean? So, I think the best way to do it is when you're really locked in and those third and fourth quarters, you have to just kind of like sacrifice and cut away the distraction and just give yourself maybe like almost like a 30 to minutes a day on your phone or only check it for certain amount of time. So, you really got to, your phone is your number one enemy because most of the distractions come from there. That's it because everything is tailing me to get towards you. So I think just, and then after the project comes out, it's no hiding. It's coming right at you. You know, but just write that third and fourth quarters, just try to let it all go. As far as about different women and how the hyper sexualized industry, I think one person I've seen kind of taking back the narratives, Billy Eilish. I think she's been doing an amazing job, you know, doing her own thing, you know, controlling her narrative, not being over sexualized. You know, the counterpoint to that as well is, what if I don't have to wear all my big clothes to do it? You know what I mean? It's like, I get close sides. So I think the answer is more like inclusion. You know, I think it needs to be more women-led teams, especially in the creative sphere, especially in music, you know, in the last year or year. So I've been really diving down and work with different female artists, you know, in different voices. I signed two artists recently. I'm really proud of one. Her name is Jaila Darden. She's from Detroit and she's like a singer, a songwriter, a producer, an engineer. She literally does everything herself in a room by herself and the music comes out absolutely phenomenal. She mixes the music herself. And I think that's an important story to tell. Another one is another singer from Brent, her name is Amalou. I think she's incredible too. She produces her music. She's very hands-on with all her branding. And I think in music and film, especially, music and film, especially, it's kind of like this thing that I don't like where women always have to be presented, you know, it's like in presenting soon. So they come out of stage and they start dancing. Like, man, can you look at more like as like creative geniuses or whatever. And I don't think that's fair. And I think that's because a lot of people who want power are kind of like tone-depth of what's going on until you start having more women in these positions and make changes in the boardroom and the people who are really cutting the checks. And that's really going to happen. I think it's going to happen all across the world in different areas. I think it's happening slower in music though. And if somebody in first hand saying it, I can tell you that's the reason why. Because some of the ideas that you're going to get in a room full of men for presenting a woman is not going to be great, you know, a sense of until is more inclusion is more diversity, especially on the higher levels. That's when things are really going to change. So I want to wrap it up with one last question, which is really about the future. So my work here is about bringing design and creative confidence to the K-12 education space. My colleague Laura and Louie are here. My friend and brother Al and my brother is Tony from high school for recording arts. And Isaac who co-formed this whole concept of hip-hop genius with me, which was all about bringing a hip-hop creativity to education. And I know you went to an alternative creative type of school and that had some influence on how you move in the world and how you've developed all this. And I would just love to hear your thoughts about how we could apply all of these principles that are up on the screen and the way that you've approached your work in these creative realms of music and photography to education. What do you think the schools need to look like that are going to make sure that all young people have the opportunity to have the kind of creative confidence that you've been cultivating with the artists that you work with and in yourself? I think going to an alternative high school, you know, I went to like, is that still a thing or is it only charter schools now? We have alternative schools. I went to all the high school in Brooklyn. And it was kind of like, have you ever seen a movie precious? It's kind of like the classes they were in where they were like 10, 12 people and they were just like, if you graduated success, but then a good thing about like my school was like sponsored by Goldman Sachs. So I got a lot of cool internships like a work that Fox News channel, I work that Goldman Sachs, I work that my local part. So it gave me a lot of opportunities that probably wouldn't have gotten to maybe have been on my high school with the level of focus. And it kind of showed, but at the time though, like I didn't know like most of these roles that we talked about today existed. You know, in the design school, you see all these type of roles and all these type of things are going on here. But like I did a talk maybe about three weeks ago at Centennial High School in Compton. You know, and they don't have any of the green that they have here and the funding and everything. And you know, when I say stuff like creative director and art director, all these things, it's not even a flip of a possibility that these roles even exist. So I think just creating awareness from really like really eight to 12 that all these different options are available. Like you know, that would have helped me a lot. Everything I do now, I didn't know was an option when I graduated from high school. I didn't know it. And I was an option. I know creative director was an option. I didn't know any of the stuff were options. You know, I would just feel like if I just even had this as a role, if I, and that's why I really want to teach a lot of this stuff in school because if I just knew like this creative process was an option, I think that, I think I like the way my life went out with this now, but I think that it would have changed a lot. I would have been a lot further, a lot faster because if I don't have like the financial capability to go to like a big Ivy League school, even go to my local school, at least I have the ability to be creative. And I just really want to show you know, I think my time on earth is going to be successful if I can just show people, especially people who look like me that this is an option. And that's my overall goal, my biggest goal. The entrepreneurial thought leader series is a Stanford E-Corner original production supported by the venture capital firm DFJ.
