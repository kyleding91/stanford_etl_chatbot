 You are listening to the Draper Fisher-Jurvinson entrepreneurial thought-leader seminar, brought to you weekly by Stanford Technology Ventures program at Stanford University School of Engineering. Now, the reason you came is not to listen to Tom Doe announcements, but to listen to Bob Sutton. Bob is one of our faculty colleagues here in the Department of Management, Science, and Engineering. He's also a key member of the Stanford Technology Ventures team, and he's one of the co-directors of the work technology and organizations group here at Stanford. He's written some best-selling books on creativity and the knowing-doing gap, and he's working on another book that's going to annoy a lot of management and surprise the rest of it. So let's give a warm round of welcome to Bob Sutton. Thank you, Bob. Thank you. Thank you. All right, so I got to give a talk. There's like 100 college professors in this audience. Oh, I'll do the best I can. College professors are like the toughest audience on earth. Okay, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to talk about some ideas about what a creative organization does, and this is a topic I've been sort of fretting over, studying, and reading about for a good 15 or 20 years, and I'm going to talk about some of the ideas that at least based from my biased perspective are the most important if you actually wanted to have an organization that was creative, something which actually may not be a good idea, and maybe we can talk about that at the end. And the main ideas I've published about creativity are in the book I published a couple of years ago called Weird Ideas That Work, but I'll also stray beyond that. And let me start out and describe the three ideas about managing creativity and to talk about sort of the headlines. The first thing, I've got a co-author named Jeff Fuffer who's over at the business school, and he always says that great organizations and great managers, like they don't do sort of really sneaky little things, they're masters of the obvious. And so the obvious thing I'm going to talk about, which sometimes doesn't seem to be quite so obvious, is we're going to talk about what creativity is and is not, since I think that helps us understand it and manage it, then I'm going to talk about really the main idea of weird ideas that work, and actually the main idea, if you look in the organizational innovation literature, that organizing for creative work requires drastically different practices, and it takes organized for routine work, something which many managers and other people say, but don't actually seem to act on. And then the last thing I'm going to talk about, which is something that I keep learning about over and over again, for some reason, creativity is the type of thing that managers, senior managers, managers at all level like to talk about, but they seem to not actually get around to doing it. So we're going to talk about the notion that talking about creativity is not enough. Okay, so let me start out with this question of what is creativity, which seems like sort of like an obvious question, maybe it's doing something new, but I have a doctoral student who's now a professor at UC Davis, named Andy Hargadon, and Andy and I spent quite a few years fretting over this. In fact, he talks a lot about this in his new book, which is called How Breakthroughs Happen. And the thing that we came upon in every creative act we could look at, essentially it was doing new things with old things. It's not like the ideas come out of thin air. It's finding some old ideas, some old concepts, doing new things with them, blending them together in new ways. And this is an incredibly simple insight, but it actually has a lot of guidance about what you should do and how you should organize a creative group or organization. And we'll get into that in more detail as we go along. And let me give you two extreme examples, sort of in terms of levels of complexity to illustrate this point. The first one is the way that Play Doe was invented. So I looked into the invention of Play Doe for my book, Where It Ideas That Work. And what we discovered was Play Doe was invented, or at least made by a guy named Joe McVicar, who had a plant. It was a plant in Central Ohio that made white goo for removing such from wallpaper. Maybe some of the professors in this room are old enough to remember. There was a point where much of the heat in the United States, which from being coal-based heating, which was sort of dirty and smudging to gas and electric. So the problem was that the smudge was going down in this market, was shrinking. And the problem Joe McVicar had is, what did he do with this goo that was being made from his plant? This white goo. And he did what people tend to do, which he called the industry experts, who had a great deal of knowledge about sort of soot and wallpaper and all that sort of stuff. And they told them essentially to do a total quality management movement, get the thing more efficient, squeeze every penny out of it, six sigma would be the modern term. But then things kept getting worse and worse until he talked to his sister-in-law, K. Zufal. And K. Zufal was a nursery school teacher, and she gave it to her kids to play with. And she said, this stuff is much easier for little kids to squeeze with her hands than the hard modeling clay. And she suggested coloring it and calling it play dough in the rest of his history. He sold the plant to Kenner for millions of dollars some years later. So that's one example. And to give you a whole other extreme complexity, there's a gray K. Some of you may know about, of the case of a guy named Andrew Wiles. Andrew Wiles was a professor who solved for Maz last theorem. And there's a movie about it and a book about it you can look up. But the interesting thing about Andrew Wiles was that he stayed at home working in his study for eight years, eight years, and he didn't tell his colleagues what he was working on. In fact, they thought he went crazy and just had stopping productive. And I could just see if I wrote on my Stanford annual report, I've been in my room working at home, but I won't tell you what I'm working on. Essentially that's what he did for eight years. And even us academics would get in trouble. This is the advantage of the tenure system, a tenure. But what he was doing during those eight years was he was using the various work of the mathematicians who came before him as puzzle pieces to solve the problem. So even the case where he has somebody sitting in a room by himself for eight years working on stuff, it's not like the ideas come out of nowhere. It's picking all that came before him and to use the Isaac Newton phrase, the reason he could travel so far was because he was standing on the shoulders of the mathematicians who came before him. And to give you a couple of other examples, I've got pictures for, and this is really sort of simple creativity that made huge bucks. I did some consulting work with People Magazine about a year ago. And the most profitable thing they've done in recent years in People Magazine is a thing called the annual. What the annual is, you know, when you see People Magazine in the store, they'll be like the best dress, the best looking, the most intriguing, those sort of issues. What they do is they smash it all together and sell to you in a book for $10. No original content at all. That's an annual and they made a fortune on those things. So that's one example. And another example which has more technology in it since this is a technology ventures program operation is if you look at the iPod, they went from having no product to having the product out in eight months. And for those of you who know this story, most of it was not original except for the interface and the industrial design. It was nearly all off the shelf stuff and that's how they could move so quickly. And in fact, I think this is an especially good lesson. If you want to have fast creativity, what you know is sort of just lock yourself in a room and only think of your own ideas. Even in the Nandra Wiles cases, he's taking places in other ideas from other places. You treat creativity as an import export business. That's how it happens fast. And that's also the reason why, and I think that's one of the things that happens with ETL perhaps accidentally or on purpose. One of the reasons I think Silicon Valley works so well is that there's sort of a sort of porous exchange of ideas. And this will be on videotape, but that's okay. To quote our president, John Hennessy, one of the first things I ever heard him say when he was our dean was one of the main services that stand out. And the reason why Silicon Valley is a place where people can come and break their NDAs or non-disclosure agreements and move ideas around Silicon Valley. So that's sort of the first big idea is that to understand what creativity is in many ways, what you need to do to make it happen is you have to have this notion of doing new things with old things. So that's the first idea. The second one is the main idea of the book where ideas that work, which is the notion that practices that instill creativity or innovation are very often the exact opposite of what happens, what passes for great management practices. And I may be able to get in trouble with some of my colleagues. Very often standard MBA education, you bring in the total quality management or the six sigma consultants. They're often going to tell you to do what is exactly the opposite of what will get you to be innovative and exhibit number one that I learned about in the course of my travels. And I think that is many of you have maybe heard of the notion that on one reason the general electric was so success wonder Jack Welch was the thing called a six sigma program where they would infuse quality and everything. Eventually I ran into some folks from the research and development part of general electric. And they said that way there will be innovative was essentially by ignoring six sigma completely because it wasn't possible to be innovative and do that stuff at the same time. And I think that is a little bit more formal if you look at the and you also have this on your handout if you can't see it very well. If you look at the literature and innovation and this is something this is not a new idea this goes back a good 40 years. We have hundreds perhaps thousands of studies published on groups and organizations. If you look at the literature and innovation, there's a distinction that runs throughout it. And it's called exploration versus exploitation. If you look at what it takes to organize for routine work, you've got to drive out variation. You want every toy to camera every McDonald's cheeseburger to be exactly the same. You've got to see old things is old things. So somebody is flying a helicopter. You don't want them pretending it's an airplane or vice versa. If they are operating on your heart at the Stanford hospital, you don't want to surgeon pretending that your heart is your pancreas. I would like to really bad operation, but it's what creative people do. And of course you would replicate the past. So if you want to and the key idea in this works for nonprofits when I show them as well, the key idea of organizing for routine work is the focuses on making money now. But if you want to organize for innovative work, you pretty much got to do the opposite thing. And before I talk a little bit more in some details about some of those opposite things, I want to make two points that are really important. The first one is that the last thing I would want to do is leave you the impression that innovation is always good and the more innovation the better. Sometimes in some corporations and in Silicon Valley we start acting like that. In fact, in many cases the opposite is true. If you devote too much money to doing new things and don't cash in on old things, you're in trouble. The question is what's the balance between doing old things and new things and to give you sort of like a rough idea. If you start looking at the research and development budgets of organizations, some of our most successful and most creative organizations will devote say if you look at Proctor and Gamble, which is getting a lot of press or being creative now, 3% of their budget goes to R&D, 3M, which is famous for being creative, 7% of their budget goes to R&D, Microsoft is 25%. Only in big farming you start getting above that and of course with those of you know about big farmer, their marketing budgets are of course still bigger than their R&D budgets to get us to buy the same drugs over and over again, maybe we don't need. So that's an important point is that it's the balance between the two that matters and it would never say the more innovation the better. So let me dig a little bit more into two of the principles because I think they're really crucial for understanding what it takes to have innovation. The first thing you need to do is to enhance variation somehow so you can get those old ideas and do new things with them and recombine them in new ways. That's very much what it takes to do innovation so things that look like failures, dead ends are the lifeblood of innovation. And if you look we've got the entrepreneurship teachers here and they all know if you look at the failure rates for our local Silicon Valley firms, ask of a node how often Kleiner Perkins is right, the wrong most of the time. If you start with the number of business plans they look at versus the ones they consider seriously versus the ones they fund to get a Google, it's a story that's nearly all failure. And that's pretty much what happens especially when you're doing something creative and when you start telling CEOs of large organizations that the way they're going to be innovative is by failing more they don't like to hear it. And to give you a little example of how this happens in one organization I know well, how many of you have heard of IDEO product development which has a lot to do with Stanford. IDEO is a product design consulting firm started by actually one of our professors David Kelly they've done everything from the first Apple mouse to like snakes for movies, I mean mechanical snakes for the anaconda movies all sorts of products. And there's a little part of IDEO which is called skyline toy design and what they do with skyline toy design is it's about eight people who sit around all day and brainstorm ideas for new toys. And these are the failure rates from the guy who runs this Brendan Boyle from 1998 he says his numbers look about the same maybe worse if you looked at them recently. So for 1998 these eight people generated 4,000 ideas typed into it he just typed this into a spreadsheet 226 were developed into a nice prototype or a drawing 12 were sold that's his definition of success two or three are moderate commercial successes. And I think venture capital probably looks about this bad and other things look worse if you look at big farmer for example and to give you a feeling for this this is my favorite IDEO failure and I don't know if you can see this but somebody may know those sort of hotel co-hangers that have a little round ball. This is a device for stealing a hotel co-hanger. Isn't that cute. And you can commercialize that anytime you want it's an idea Brendan couldn't sell and to give you some idea of success I brought some but here's the aerobi football I'm causing sound problems and then this is my favorite thing I have hundreds of these on my roof I roofs from my kids. It's a thing called a finger blaster like foul balls going to hit the people way in the back. So if you go to IDEO they have lots of these. Okay so that's another success but they have to have an incredible number of failures to have that actually succeed. Okay so that's the first point the second principle is what I call and I stole this from the comedian George Carl and I figured out eventually the Vuja da mentality. This is the opposite of deja vu so if deja vu is you have a new experience but it feels like it's old. This is when you have an old experience and you try to look at it in a new light and of course as I've already said this is a disaster and routine work but it's one of the key things that creative groups and people and organizations do and I'll give you two quick examples. One and this I'll get you back to your basic statistics for some of you is that there was a statistician named Abraham Wald who was sent over to England to a World War II to try to reduce the number of B17s and B24s that were being shot down and what he did was he looked to see where the holes were in the planes that were coming back and he recommended putting more armor where there were no holes. Okay we got the Stanford students here among other people why did he recommend putting armor where there were no holes. Oh good Dave yeah. Because the planes that they were looking at were the ones that came back. He's got it so Dave's got it Dave's Sanford right there so anyways so Dave's got it that the planes that were being shot down were the ones he was on a round of applause. We got somebody for Dave. First one right thanks. It took a couple of tries for people the day so you're doing well. Anyways and so he recommended putting the armor and you can see the places where he wasn't seeing holes following Dave's point sort of between the tail and between the fuselage. Another one is Jeff Hawkins solution to the handwriting recognition problem. Now many of you may know where's Tom Bair as Tom raised your hand. One reason we have Tom as a Stanford professor is he was involved in these pen based computing companies startups in the early in the kind of mid 90s and it didn't make it he's shooting the thing back of me. Good shot Tom. Anyways so luckily that didn't work so Tom's here among other reasons and one of the problems with all those startups in the Newton is another example. I mean this almost killed Apple too and wasted a lot of Silicon Valley venture capital or not wasted spent I shouldn't use the word wasted. Is is that there was this handwriting recognition problem and and I remember sort of towards the end of this era. Being in David Kelly the CEO of I do office and he had a whole bunch of the failed products on his office and he said. You know there's everybody's failed and there's one guy left named Jeff Hawkins and Jeff Hawkins believes that he has a product to be successful but he has to teach Americans a new handwriting system. You think about that if you're going to propose a product that requires people learning a new handwriting system it's like such a stupid idea it's incredible. So how do you learn the graffiti system on the palm. Yeah I mean look at this I mean this is not like a random sample audience but you're the target audience and it still seems like an incredibly stupid idea to me but but that's how he looked at it in another way. Okay so those are the big ideas about what it takes to have a creative organization. I'm not going to talk a huge amount at least in my sort of formal prepared amount remarks about my weird ideas in the handout. It's sort of like the two page summary of the entire book weird ideas that work you don't have to buy it if you just look at that would be one argument. But the basic way that I came up with the weird ideas that work for that book was that I looked to see what the research evidence in theory was and then I looked to see which ideas would enhance variation, VUJADAN breaking from the past. And I came up with a set of ideas and stated them in such a way that they might just be a little bit annoying or at least sound weird. And just to give you a feeling for them what I'll do is I'll give you two of them to so you can think about this. The first one is to encourage people to ignore and defy superiors and peers. Now this is a good illustration of the difference between the logic of routine work and creative work. If somebody is flying the airplane you're on or you're having a surgical procedure done on you, you don't want people ignoring the head surgeon or the head pilot. But if it's a situation you want creativity, you want variation, then there's an argument that this is a way to get it. And in fact when we look at survey research there's a moderate amount of survey research that shows that when you ask what kind of supervisors will have the most creative work groups, they tend to be people who devote less attention to the people who work for them and let them break the rules. And then lastly when you go on and nominate who are your most creative people, they're people who bend or break the rules and who ignore and defy authority, sort of like the Stanford faculty if you want an example of a group that acts like this. So when you start going in industry there's lots of cases, especially in Silicon Valley which I know best where creativity has been done despite rather than because of management. And the case that I studied actually when I first moved back to the Bay Area in 1983 was the Atari Corporation. Atari was very interesting because in the late 70s it was acquired by a movie company Warner Brothers. And there are all these people who know anything about the gaming industry, they brought in these people from the movie industry and they told the game designers to stop designing games and to design things like programs for keeping tracks of recipes. And what that was that the game designers lied to their bosses about what they were working on and would show them sort of mock ups of programs for keeping track of recipes and balancing your checkbook and the like. And they kept designing games and on the back of that defiance at least for a little while until they got another trouble Atari was this enormously successful company. And if you look at the history of gaming by the way which always has a sort of illegitimate sort of aspect to it and you can see this at Microsoft as well for the folks who designed direct acts that makes playing games possible very often it's something that's done an unauthorized sort of way. There's lots of organizations that if you start looking at creative organizations that have sort of official policies or procedures that enable this to happen sort of management by looking the other way or management by getting out of the way three M's had the 15% rule for years and if you're in a technical job you do work. 15% of your work doesn't have to be authorized Amazon 3M now Google all have sort of work practices that encourage that and my favorite example from Silicon Valley history though comes from Chuck House and Chuck House is this kind of interesting guy who's actually still around he actually works for Intel now because his startup got acquired. This wasn't about 1969 and Chuck was working on an oscilloscope and was actually told directly by David Packard himself to stop working in the dumb idea and to do something else and what Chuck House did it was instead of listening to David Packard he said he was going on a vacation and what he actually did was he drove around the country and got a couple million dollars with orders for this oscilloscope and in 1969 a couple million dollars was real money and the result was they made it was a successful company. So he got a product and then in 1981 Chuck House he got an award from David Packard and I forgot exactly it says extraordinary contempt defiance beyond the normal call of engineering and Tom Bars and I have seen his resume it's on his resume so this is an idea of sort of Packard realizing he had to encourage that kind of thing in the culture. And let me just go through one to one more and I'll make sure and leave a good 15 or so minutes for discussion but another one which is one of the ones that sort of more out there is to not try to learn anything from people who say they've solved the problems you face. I'm a great believer in expertise and in fact I'll talk about that in a minute but if you want to bring some sort of varied ideas in a different perspective in your organization. There's a good argument for bringing in ignorant people and people who know about other things because they're not biased by what's right in the industry and what the solution is and to give you one of the more famous examples you've all heard of Jane Goodall who got famous studying chimpanzees in the wild. She was hired by the famous anthropologist Lewis Leake and he trained her in field observation methods she was a young undergraduate and when she said to Lewis Leake what I want to do is I want to read the literature now in chimpanzees since I'm going to be spending years of my life studying them in the wild. Lewis Leake wouldn't let her read the literature because it would bias what she saw and didn't see. So there are times when ignorance is very valuable and I'm not somebody who says ignorance should be done all the time I think that sort of ignorance and knowledge are tag team partners in life and in it's no accident she was sort of linked to like this famous anthropologist. So if you look at the list in front of you we can maybe talk more about some of the weird ideas this is just to sort of give you if you will sort of highlight in a perspective on this. And then the last main idea I want to talk about is something that comes more from the work that I did with my colleague Jeff Feffer on the knowing doing gap and this sort of comes from the realization that we had that an innovation and a whole bunch of other management practices. We kept running into situations where people would seem to know what to do to make their organizations more creative but it wouldn't actually happen and they would act like talking about it was enough they wouldn't actually have to do it. And the way that I got especially interested in this was I guess about 10 or 11 years ago after they made me a full professor at Stanford and there was only so many things they could do to me. So I started doing a little bit more consulting and I actually did my first consulting job with the top management team of a Fortune 100 company so it was a big company. And they were doing this amazing thing that was actually even worse than what the fact Stanford faculty doing do typically. And like we have like no real deliverables we have ridiculous amount of job security and we tend to make decisions and not implement them at times. And they were big decisions one of the decisions was putting the name of their product on their product which seems like an important thing to do. The other one more related to creativity is that their product development organization was organized into functional silos. So things like industrial design engineering, design for manufacturability marketing things like that. And so there were these functional silos and there would be these huge teams of like 70 or 80 people on every person seemed to the definition of being on a team was you sort of returned half your emails. So the recommendation was made or not the recommendation of the decision was made to move to more project based smaller focus teams where people had 100% of their time devoted to it or at least 50%. They kept making those decisions over and over again and then they never actually implemented them. And I think it was no accident by the way that not all members but many members of the senior team of this organization were populated by people used to be management consultants. Because with all due respect to companies like McKinsey and Bain and the like sometimes those people make good managers. But for the most part the way you make money at McKinsey and Bain is you don't implement stuff you actually just tell people to do it. And hope it actually gets done when you leave. And then the clients don't do it of course you can blame them for not implementing it. When you become a manager you actually have to make sure that things get done. And of course in the starter if you don't do stuff you're dead like immediately. So this becomes more apparent than when you're running a huge company. So why does this thing happen? Why does talk substitute for action? The sort of the big reason the headline is is talk happens now you can tell whether somebody is a smart talker. Whether they're any good at actually turning knowledge into action is a whole nother sort of thing in a different set of skill sets. Different kind of skill set. And then some organizations, especially organizations by the way that move people around too much, make this problem worse by simply promoting the smart talkers as opposed to the people actually make sure that things get done. So that's some of the major reasons that happens and we can talk about this in detail if there's time afterwards. And let me talk about three especially important ideas for avoiding the smart talk trap. The first one is although I'm a fan of ignorance in the right situation. I'm not a fan of ignorance in terms of putting people in senior management positions. It actually turns out and we actually have some quite interesting suggestive quantitative evidence now as well that it actually turns out that when people understand the work they're managing rather than having some creative charismatic CEO comes from another industry. For the most part it actually pays to have somebody who understands the industry in the way the organization works. And I'll give you two examples. One is George Zimmer in the men's warehouse. George Zimmer might be sort of almost like a comical figure and he's the guy who's on television. He says I guarantee it. George Zimmer is actually dominating with his men's warehouse organizations a declining industry. I mean hardly anybody buys suits anymore at least in Silicon Valley and other places they do. But in men's warehouse it's an organization that's essentially designed to sell people things they don't want to buy and they don't want to be there. And on the backs of that it's been very successful and it's no accident that George Zimmer's father was in the clothing business and also invested in his initial business. Another example is that is Don Peterson at Ford Motor Company. When Don Peterson was brought in and this was in the late 70s to Ford Motor Company. They were on the verge of declaring bankruptcy. They were an enormous trouble. And as Don Peterson said they were so desperate they put somebody in charge who actually knew something about cars. In fact there's a story he told my co-author Jeff Thepfer so he was at his first top management team meeting where he was CEO. And after about 90 minutes he made a comment to the top management team. He pointed out that nobody had used the word car or truck in the first 90 minutes and maybe that was part of their problem. And in fact if you look at Ford Motor Company it's sort of deja vu all over again. They had the same problem again. They got brought in this guy Jacques Nasser who was distracting him again. They got rid of Jacques Nasser and now Bill Ford is focusing on cars again. He's a car guy and they seem to be coming back some. So it's one of those things that's incredibly obvious that doesn't happen. And then there's the question so what happens if you bring in a CEO or you're brought in as a leader to run an organization that you don't know anything about? Well a good interesting case is what Bill George did at Medtronic. Bill George is one of those good to great CEOs in Jim Collins books. Book and he brought, I'm sure he didn't do it alone, he brought Medtronic from a $2 billion to a $60 billion company. If you talk to Bill George what he'll tell you is the first nine months he was CEO since he didn't know anything about the medical device business. He spent 50% of his time watching surgeons put in Medtronic devices asking them questions so he actually learned something about the way that the core part of the business work. And if you look at what usually happens with a typical sort of charismatic sort of CEO who's going to come in and turn around a company and typically what they will do is they'll run around and they'll do all sorts of public speaking events. For example, we had Colley Freena here very early. It was one of her first events was at ETL. Wasn't it Tom signed her up before she was CEO. So Colley Freena flies all over the world giving speeches about U of Packard. Now I'm going to get in trouble with U of Packard. But I would submit Cheats to spend a little bit more time focusing on what's going on in her company rather than just flying from place to place in her jet. And many people I know U of Packard would agree with me. I'm probably getting in trouble with U of Packard now. That's okay. This money comes from U of Packard we're sitting in right now at this building. The second notion is that simple ideas are easier to execute. And Steve Jobs, another very controversial person in Silicon Valley, sort of interesting that when he came back and took over Apple in 1997, this is just a partial list of some of the hardware that was floating around. In fact, when I show it to Apple people who were there will start listing it off. The list is actually about twice as long as this. Plus there was a huge amount of software that was even worse. And what Jobs did in his usual subtle fashion was within one year since, as the question said, customers couldn't figure out the difference between like a performance 6,500 or a 4,300. They couldn't even tell their friends which one to buy. Within one year he got rid of everything and went to a simple two by two, which is laptop, desktop, home office. They've more or less followed ever since. And this is also, this is a footnote, but this is also a result of having an organization where there's a bunch of coalitions that have medium power. That was one of the problems at Apple, especially during the scully days. And to some extent, Gil Emilio, it a bunch of sort of medium power coalitions so everybody could sort of get part of what they wanted instead of having a whole strategy. And then the last point, we talk a lot about charisma and how important exciting CEO, charismatic CEOs are. It isn't just Jim Collins book. There's other research that suggests that having an exciting charismatic CEO, although helpful at times, at least for short term gains, is not always all that it's cracked up to be. And I'm going to quote my colleague Charles O'Reilly. Charles O'Reilly has this argument that smart leaders are exciting because they're always talking about different ideas. They talk about every new idea they seem. They're always exciting because they always have a new idea. But his argument is that wise leaders are boring because they say the same thing over and over and over again until it's done. Jack Welch, as somebody who had a lot of ideas I actually don't like and I could show you empirically, we're actually probably wrong. But one thing Jack Welch was good about doing was making very clear to his people that we're just going to do a few things and we're do them till they're done. And when Jeff F. Freny were doing research for our book, The Knowing Doing Gap, we interviewed a guy named Jim Bailey who was head of the quality movement at then City Bank. It's now City Group. And Jim Bailey was complaining that the reason they're having so much trouble getting traction in their quality movement was that they weren't focusing enough attention on us. And this comes straight from an interview that we did with him and you can sort of look at the list that at City Bank at that time you get certified for five days of training at geotakes six weeks. If you look at some of the rewards and promotion in general electric you did 40% of your compensation was tied to getting your quality goals and you didn't get a promotion unless you hit your quality goals. And at City Bank it was completely unclear about the link. And finally the thing he was complaining about the most is he couldn't get John read another senior executives to do symbolic things like teaching quality classes to show it mattered. Whereas Jack Welch and other senior executives were constantly at Croughtonville their executive ed facility actually teaching it. And you can in sort of the lesson here also as sort of an ending point if you talk about smart talk and smart action the speed at which smart talk can happen is incredibly fast. I'm a professor I can like spew out all sorts of management on practices but when you look at the speed at which organizational change including in a startup can happen it's going to happen a lot slower. And I think that was one of the problems that we had during the dot com boom during the dot com boom the talk and often the misinformation was going at an incredible rate but the action can only happen so fast. In fact I was just talking to Mr. Lee about a mutual friend of ours Jorge del Calvo and he's a local lawyer and Jorge told me this great line during the height of the dot com boom which was that his definition of a dot com CEO was the same as Mark Twain's definition of a gold mine which is that if you remember that definition that it was a gold mine is a whole in the ground with a liar sitting on top of it. And I think we were getting a lot of that sort of smart talk sort of stuff anyhow and we sort of figured out I think it was the holes in the grounds that didn't have liars sitting on top of them that that that we're still sort of left with. Okay so two quick parting thoughts and then we'll have 15 minutes for you guys to ask questions and react. The first one and this is like the entrepreneurial thought leaders and you bring in all these venture capitalists and CEOs in this and people are constantly going to tell you about all the stuff they did to make things happen and I've also pushed on some of this mythology by talking about Steve jobs quickly reorganizing apple and the like. One of the things that gets very clear if you look at research on what it takes for creative work to happen there's a lot of evidence that the things that managers typically do especially they have MBAs asking a lot of questions asking what your value added is all that classics or stuff those things tend to drive out creativity and what they do is they lean people to drift towards what they know is going to succeed. So in the case especially when it comes to managing creative work the question of first do no harm is a standard especially needs to be applied and I would like to see the evidence we don't have it for startups but I wonder whether active boards actually really help but I think that active boards who in startups is they replace the CEO a lot and they bring a CEO into the same situation who faces the same set of problems that's a personal opinion but I would bet the evidence on it and to give you my favorite quote from somebody who's man. So I'm somebody who's managed a lot of creative work that's in this spirit bill kind this is bill coin after you plan to see in the ground you don't dig it up every week to see how it's doing and this is a guy who managed R and D at 3M for about 15 years he said that much of his job was just leaving his folks alone and protecting them from the people in organizational strategy said that was a lot of what his job was that is a final point and especially since we're in the engineering schools engineering engineering engineering and you know what I'm saying is that I'm going to do that. The engineers actually don't like to talk about marketing they have the sort of notion that if I design something brilliant everybody's just going to buy it. It actually turns out if you look at the history of famous creators, famous inventors there's almost always somebody involved who can sell. We already mentioned Steve Jobs clearly he can sell if you look at the case of the steamboat steamboat one of the biggest misconceptions in history is that this guy named Robert Fulton invented it. There were many steamboats around at the time that Robert Fulton had his steamboat which was the turn of the 19th century and a lot of them were technically superior to his but he was the guy who could sell. It's no accident we remember him as the inventor Thomas Edison my former doctoral student Andy Hargitonson a lot of work on Thomas Edison. He can show you extensive quotes of people and Thomas Edison's lab complaining that he was a really lousy inventor and it was more like PT Barnum than anybody else. He was great at attracting press attention for Edison products and also for bringing in money but he actually was not that great an inventor. And that's one of those sort of notions that I think is sometimes hard for engineers to accept although not hard for MBAs to accept the notion that marketing actually matters. Okay so we've got that's sort of the end of my prepared remarks we've got about 15 minutes any reactions you've got the weird ideas there and maybe you have some other more general sort of comments. Yes sir. Please use the mic. Do you work for HP? Am I getting in trouble? No but the HP people I work with would make sure all the microphones are turned off and then agree. The inventor of the Furby or the couple invented the Furby has been a least part of their time they moved there to raise their kids and Caleb Chung got his start working for me. Talk a little further away from the microphone a little far away. How's this? Perfect. But he worked for Mattel and they had a building where apparently they locked everybody in on a floor through all sorts of crazy people together as he shared a dead he was a standup comic who shared a desk with the semiconductor physicist and they threw in a linguist. The guy with the PhD in linguistics in this which all turned out to play into if you know the Furby story and how Furby's work you can sort of understand how this went. Basically they locked him in and said they could let him out at the end of the day lock him in till five and they had to come up with as many good ideas as they as they could and you know that it fits his model tremendously. Well I mean that's a fabulous story and as sort of a footnote so so the comment here I guess you all heard it is that the way the Furby was designed as they locked so what was it a standup comic? Well as a standup comic his wife was an industrial designer and the same one and basically that when he went out on his own they started working on this that he he had to have the chip that would work for the Furby but they couldn't have an expensive chip but they needed the linguist because the chip didn't have a lot of ability to do resolution of the sound. So they had to find out the right sounds that the right phonemes that would work so they had a list of phonemes that the computer chip could understand then they designed the Lang the Furby language so they could communicate sitting around a table with a whole lot of wine. So so these ideas this is sort of like the notion of skunk words you lock people away and you sort of protect them from sort of lack of people who might not be so wise from a corporate perspective and then you commercialize it but there's another part to this which I think is important to emphasize that organizations that rely heavily on things that are not going to be a part of the story. So if you rely heavily on things like skunk works and isolations, isolation only works when there's some way to get the ideas into the mainstream of the corporate idea so you got to isolate them and you got to have some way to sort of pull the ideas out or it doesn't happen. Well Furby ended up actually being done outside of it they didn't go with that idea and then went it with Tiger and most of Tiger's management that he dealt with are not designers but lawyers defending IP is their business. Okay some other in the back I'm trying to tell you. So you mentioned that some companies like Google allow their employees to allocate a certain amount a certain percentage of their time towards say innovative ideas or creative projects. Is this are you an advocate of that and do you recommend all companies to pursue that model? Well I think that any so I think that I mean the goal is to have some way to have variation that that management kind of doesn't know about because I don't believe that management necessarily has superior knowledge and there are lots of companies that actually do it but note we're talking about situations where people are doing creative work. Anything that's doing routine like I don't really understand the value of allowing somebody who is like like an engineer who is trying to a quality engineer to do that there might be some value but we're talking about more sort of like extreme creative work. The other thing is that that's the kind of thing that may not fit into some company cultures and some other things are necessary and in fact I think the argument that I'm a lot of creativity happens despite rather than because of management and organizations. There's sort of like an undergrowing around culture is one of those things that keeps many organizations going and I'll give an example some years ago we had this huge German engineering company called Siemens. Spend a lot of money and executive education here I think they probably wasted the money we could that's a whole nother story but they told me when I was talking about this sort of things that Siemens there was something known in the culture is a submarine project. And the way that many innovations happen at Siemens was that you would get an idea you'd find a senior manager to support it or get some resources and you'd go underground and tell nobody we're working on or actually go beneath the surface and you came up with nothing you would die underneath the surface and not tell anybody but if you came up with something that worked you would find either your original supporter or another one and they would take credit for it so it looked like this really high success rate when they actually didn't. And sort of the Atari stories and other one of those so that's one of the things that happens and I think that makes engineering and other technical companies great is sometimes they do great things despite rather because of management and when management won't support it they spin out and do a start up of course that's the way that many startups have happened around here is people do work on company time they don't tell their manager or hopefully at least they tell them because they're supposed to and they say no when they go and start a company. Other commons are questions yes. You showed a slide from a city bank and G.E. and there's public program when they did it earlier you talked about people G.E. actually ignore the public program to be created so are you going to have to kind of manage the paradox of contradiction? Well I don't know whether it's paradox or contradiction to me one point of my life I spent a huge amount of time trying to figure out the word paradox meant I got so confused I don't use that word anymore but the fact is the fact is that to have an organization both make money in the short term and and have innovative ideas and the one one they've got to do something that looks like hypocrisy which is that in the case of general electric a lot of the businesses a lot of parts of general electric are doing the same thing over again manufacturing providing providing services with having zero defects you want that every time that you deal with general general electric sort of service you don't want to have a different experience so the question is separating the two but the problem that general electric had was they're trying to to do something that's not going to work and trying to seek sigma creative work in zero defects and driving out variation I don't think works very well but for the most part I mean go back to sort of the ratio of the typical company like Procter and Gamble that spends 3% of its budget on R&D most of what Procter and Gamble does and should do should be to make products so that every two of Crest toothpaste we want to be exactly the same so it depends what you're doing so I don't know about the word paradox maybe contradiction or hypocrisy I'm more comfortable with but we can have a conversation with you but we can have a conversation about how confused I'm about the word paradox at some point yes who else the front row yes I shouldn't you know I don't want to talk about things and you want to see what you do and there's all these diverse attacking what what is the exact thing you want to support the agency and what can they do specifically create that with the top right trust or any one secret that is happening how do they create a decision they need to make a trust in a new color way need to decide which ones to do. Well there's two parts of that question the first one is I think addressed in some of my talk about so what if you want to have a creative culture there's a lot of the ideas on your list the single most important sort of diagnostic question I would use if you want to have a creative culture is what happens when people fail if if failures are okay that's probably the single most important one. Now the other question you ask is one I don't know the answer to and at this point I don't believe anybody knows the answer to which is trying to figure out which new creative ideas are good versus bad I've actually had a couple of doctoral students try to figure out what works so these things called gate systems the only people who make really strong arguments that gate systems work are people who either sell them from management firms or in organizations whose jobs depend on them. If you actually started look trying to find evidence about ways to reduce the failure rate and innovation it's very hard to find ways it actually work otherwise you wouldn't have companies like Kleiner Perkins in Excel having such high failure rates and such high failure rates a new product introduction and the fact that most companies die it just wouldn't happen but there is one thing you can do and it's one of the weird ideas there's an argument that once you fund something what you should do so so there's all this stuff you're trying to decide what to do and then you'll pick like one thing the argument is at that point you should dilute yourself and everybody else and to believe me it's going to be successful because there's this thing called the self-fulfilling prophecy and it actually turns out that that works it also increases the probability of throw good money after bad it's got a negative underbelly. So but if you can figure out the magical way to figure out which products which startups which new ideas are going to be successful and which aren't I want to talk to you because my bet at this point is it's nearly a random process. Some things help having prestigious backers having money all that sort of stuff helps having belief but actually figure out which ideas are right or wrong is very tough yes. To continue that good versus bad so who do you run these weird ideas by who do you run the great ideas by well there's a lot of controversy about you to try to figure which ones are good versus bad. Well I mean that's one of those questions it just depends on the nature of the industry but I'll give you an example of the one group I don't trust versus one I trust a little bit more which is that if you start using something like focus groups especially if it's a new sort of more radical innovation people have never seen they're not very valuable. So I'm going to go back to the example I would this notion of going directly where users are actually operating is probably a good idea and the other thing that you want to be careful of is selling ideas to managers who manage work they don't understand and I'm going to get in trouble with this as well. If you look at the fate of most enterprise software that's implemented the average implementation fails and typically it's sold to an IT department with no discussion with the users at all and it's Stanford we're having this horrible oracle of the world. So that's like sort of one pathway but I mean there's ideas and ways to increase your odds of success but for the most part I think innovation is a business that's fraught with failure and you've got to accept that. We have time a couple more questions. Somebody in the back. The research in university what is interesting one implication and we certainly know this is that most of the money spent on research in universities doesn't lead to any new commercially viable products although maybe a lot of good academic careers which we like to have. But enough of that stuff succeeds and it keeps the whole engine running. So I mean the alternative is for any one project in the school of engineering for that one particular project it's not a rational decision to fund it or to go forward but for sort of the good of the system is a whole and it's a not a good idea to move forward and in fact it is sort of an odd thing about innovation which what it does and this is probably something to say an ETL is going to get me in trouble. What you're doing is you're largely enticing people into a situation where they're going to fail to support a larger system where people hold a large portfolio succeed. And I think if you look at the numbers it pretty much supports that so I mean so how many people had to write business plans go give pitches at Cliner Perkins go start businesses you know on the backs of that what it take to have Google be successful we talk about Google success but there's a lot of people who threw themselves against the wall who did not succeed. But on the backs of that we have we have like enough successful companies to keep the whole thing going. So and I think that's basically what the numbers show and it is interesting the degree to which we misremember failures we never seem to want to talk about them. Yeah. It's the quick eannick to in support of your argument that it really is good to honor failure I was there during the 80s and 90s and I can remember as if it was yesterday when we created this lighting product which was a terrific product great technology except it costs more than any person would buy like 10 or 15 bucks and how many are going to go into your shopping basket. So the project was killed and Jack said to the guy who ran lighting and Cleveland multi million dollar business a very important business person in his own right that he was going to measure him on how well he treated the team. He not only didn't want them punished for this failure which cost us a few million dollars he wanted them to be promoted and he wanted them to be seen to be promoted in order to encourage people to get out of the bureaucracy in the way of in the group think that companies like GE normally have. So that's like a fabulous testimony on so so Jack what could do innovation I get I guess to allow things to six sigma applies to that at all. That's that's fabulous I mean another example of this is I've been doing a little work with the herst corporation which went onto these newspapers and magazines and TV stations and there was a woman who started a new magazine that failed and the CEO of herst wanted to encourage creativity so what he did was he promoted her and told everybody why. So it's sort of consistent with sort of the jack's approach Jack welches. It's a great testimony I've always looking for those yes last question do you feel innovation practices are where it could be at the university level where who's asking that I am right here. Do you feel innovation practices are where they could be at the university level and if not what is the knowing doing gap here well certainly the so the question is like how good or bad are we at it stand for. And I will be mom on other parts of the university but one thing I will say that I guess the school of engineering could be more innovative but this is a place it actually encourage incredible risk taking and so there's been three initiatives I've been involved in in the last seven or eight years. The first one was the center for work technology and organization john hennessey gave us what he called venture capital money to start it. Stanford Technology Ventures program which is really a pretty wacky program the time and teen are running here. It looks like a high risk adventure and then finally some of you may know I'm involved in something called the D school or the design school the David Kelly is leading which again is the kind of so basically in the case of David Kelly we've got somebody who's got no PhD and does no research. And has no doctoral students but they made him a full professor and gave him a doubt chair and we're having him lead this design school thing because they think it's the right thing for the school to do so I'm sure the school of engineering has parts of it that's stifle innovation but compared to other parts I know of an academia it's pretty good. The other place it's actually surprisingly good I need to say something good about Harvard Harvard Business School under Kim Clark is pretty good about trying some pretty weird stuff. So I hate to give them credit but I would give them credit as well but it's not perfect anywhere but it's not bad. And I'm done right Josh? All right thank you guys very much. I'm going to back. So on behalf of this, I'd like to thank you for speaking today. Thank you. I did a little trophy thing. Thank you. All right. Thank you.
