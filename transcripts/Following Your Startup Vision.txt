 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Today we have a really remarkable speaker. We have Brent Constance, who is an amazing inventor entrepreneur. His specialty is something we've never had discussed here before. He is a specialist in cement and has over 60 patents related to cement. Now you might think that this is particularly interesting, but it is absolutely fascinating. In fact, he has started several companies in all different areas related to cement, including now a news company related to water desalination, medical cement vent for bones in the operating room, and most recently, Calera, where they look at carbon sequestration in cement. He is going to tell us all sorts of stories and insights about being an inventor and an entrepreneur, and I can't wait. Without further ado, Brent. Thanks, Tina. Usually, when I give a talk, I have technical slides and I'm talking about one company or one project I'm working on. This is a real treat for me. Tina asked me, instead of showing us all the science, why don't you describe your entrepreneurial experiences that you've had? Because that would mean the most to the students here, to hear the different experiences I've been through. What I'm going to do is go through my last four companies that I founded and was a CEO of and talk about a lot of similarities in some of the entrepreneurial strategies that I took and what worked and some of the implications of that. The first thing that came to mind, Tina, when you said, just talk about your experiences, I thought about a famous local musician, Carlos Santana, and they asked Carlos, hey, Carlos, what is the coolest thing about being Carlos Santana? He said inevitably, when we go out to dinner, a couple will come up to us and say, we can see one of our children to Samba Pati, which is one of his sons. How inspiring it is. But if you ask me, what is the most inspiring thing or the coolest thing about being a serial entrepreneur? It's starting companies that's like kicking off an avalanche and you can sit back and watch. The people that join you, your employees, the whole audience, get actually more excited about it than you ever were and see things and take it in new directions. If you've ever skied powder and jumped off a cornice, some of those avalanches don't go anywhere and they fizzle out, some of them just take off and they're out of control. These companies are really like building a fire. Fire's some smolder out, some get going, some are out of control. That's really what happens when you've found a company, you come up with an idea and people see that idea, investors, employees, competitors. The whole world catch that idea and they take it. The coolest thing is watching that happen and where all that goes. When it started back here at Stanford in 1986, I was starting my first company and I was a fresh PhD and I linked up with a guy in the B school who thought it was a good idea of what I was doing and helped me out and introduced me to a professor at the time named Pitch Johnson and his class wrote my first business plan. They wrote the best business plan and I wish we'd followed it, we didn't follow it. It was an incredible plan. At that time I was 27, I was just trying to raise some seed money and it was very hard to raise seed money. My PhD was in geology and my subject area is called bio mineralization. By the way, if you want to hear about my science, I'm a consulting professor here and I teach it in the spring. It's cross listed in GES and in mechanical engineering in the medical school. The bio mineralization is the most esoteric geeky subject probably on the planet and most people don't really pay much attention to it. What I've done at that time is decided I really wanted to do something really important and I become aware at the time of the problems with healthcare. I learned that the largest healthcare expenditure was fixing bone fractures. I would have thought it was heart disease, maybe. When you have a heart attack, you die and you're off the books. When you have a hip fracture, that's when the spending starts. I was just talking to Tom. We had a meeting that his brother helps put down a pebble beach called the Medical Vice CEO Summit. I was only CEO and invited to it for 10 years in a row. One year we had Tommy Thompson down there and he told us that healthcare expenditure is about a fifth of the GDP. With diabetes, it's going to go up to about a quarter. The biggest part of that is actually hip fractures and postmenopausal women. It's the biggest dollar figure. I thought about that and I had ideas about generating skeleton on my own when I was working in the French Polynesia in the two-mo two archipelago. I'd seen corals grow at incredible rates. My PhD thesis was on how they do that and I was able to actually make their skeletons grow in test tubes. I thought, geez, if I could do that in the operating room, that would be phenomenal. I founded Norean, my first company. I got Pitchet Ancens' class to do my business plan. We're not to raise seed capital. The first person I talked to was Jeff Feffer, who's still a professor here in the business school. Jeff invested in my company. There was another professor named David Teese, who's now up at the Haas School at Berkeley who invested. At that time, son, micro systems was really young and Scott McNeely and Vinod Koshla and those guys were pretty young. I used to go out with them and they would pay for my beers and burgers, which at the time was a significant amount of money. I really appreciated that. I couldn't get Vinod to invest because he had just joined Cliner Perkins and they had some other investment. He got his buddy Scott to invest. So Scott McNeely, who became the CEO and I guess Chairman at Sun, was my other seed around investor. Scott told me a bunch of stories and Scott, I want to relay one story that Scott and Vinod would always say. The way they found Bill Joy for son, micro systems is they went and interviewed dozens and dozens of people and every time they interviewed somebody, they'd say who's the best person in the field you know in that area and they'd go interview that person and then they'd keep going. Then finally, someone said Bill Joy, who was a professor at Berkeley who had written Unix that time and Andy, the grad student they'd found it was, said, oh, I know Bill. And they used that strategy and I've used that strategy consistently is always absolutely try to find the very best person in the world. As I talk about some of the companies, you'll see some of the management that I've been able to recruit has just been insane. The people have come and joined me. Something that I've been able to do that I think helped me came from my unique educational experience. When you study bio mineralization, you have to know biology and crystallography and geology. So they're two disparate fields. It would be like politics and economics or something like that. And it's sort of like speaking two languages. Once you speak two, speaking the third, easier and then the fourth and the fifth and all that, to be able to be cross disciplinary and talk across fields is extremely important because you bring the ignorance from outside the field and ignorance is bliss. You don't see that it's not a problem. So when I went out to the first orthopedic surgeons and said, hey, why are you guys pinning these fractures together? The screws don't even hold. It causes pain. They don't work. The patient's in the hospital. Dies of deep vein thrombosis. Why don't you just do something and get them up and walking. Let's just cement the fracture. That was an insane concept. When we went into the FDA and talked to them, they didn't even know whether I was talking about a drug or a device. But how'd I been trained in orthopedic surgery or even knew anything about it? I never would have thought, well, let's cement the fractures instead of pinning them together. The Northern experience allowed me to go out, raise capital, get a company going. It was an interesting time that maybe some of the students can relate to. I just finished my PhD. I was doing a postdoc at the US Geologic Survey over here on Middlefield. I'd just been given a full bright to go to the Whitesman to work on my area. I was going to take a professorship at Caltech. The founder of my field was going to be at the Whitesman with me to train me before I went back to Caltech to start my academic career. I was in the middle starting a company. To my parents' disappointment, all my professors' disappointment, they said, you're crazy to go start a company. My wife supported me and I got it started and got it going. It's not always easy to start a company. It was very hard to get the money together to get that going. We ended up raising about $56 million in venture capital and probably another $30 million in other grants and corporate deals and things like that. One of the lessons learned from the Norean experience is anytime you go out and do something new and you're addressing the largest healthcare expenditure in the United States, there's a lot of incumbents. They're people that are on that gravy train already that you're disrupting. If you go to a large orthopedic company and tell them, well, you know, the $4 billion worth of hip-and-plants you're selling, we got a better way to do it, have less pain and suffering. It's going to cost less. It's going to be better for everybody. Or you tell an orthopedic surgeon who, after medical school, did their internships and spent seven years of residency learning how to put those hip-and-plants in, we're not going to need you guys. It's really hard to get things adopted and what was really interesting is that time, even though the biggest fracture I was trying to address was the hip fracture and everyone sort of the story, grandma, they're fell down, went to the hospital, she didn't come home because she died of pneumonia in the hospital or something. That's because these fractures are so tough. The other one I really wanted to get was the vertebral fracture, especially in Asia, you'll see an older post-menopausal woman like this. These are a number of vertebral fractures which had never been treated before except with calcium, vitamin D, pain pills and go home. They would go see the endocrinologist and at that time, my board, my venture board, said, no one treats that. You have to go into an existing field and compete with those big hip companies. I said, but yeah, there's 550,000 of these returbo-compression fractures in the spine every year and there's little ladies going through pain and it's terrible. Why don't we work on that? We ended up not working on it and another company was spun off from Noreen at that time called Kaifon. Kaifon had a hard road, it took almost two decades to do it, but they were sold to a metronome for $3.9 billion just a couple of years ago because they stuck to the plan, the original mission, the original idea. Noreen is part of synthase which has the world's largest market, you could share in the fracture market and that products in every operating room in the world that does orthopedic surgery and it's helping out a lot of people. It's really interesting, I see this with all my companies. We have the big initial vision and in almost every case that's the right vision. As you go along, especially investors who want to see something very tangible very soon, we'll find easier ways to monetize your inventions and really not get it to the full extent of where you would like to take it. It's interesting in coming up with a big idea, I think if you're going to go forward with it, what you really want to do is make sure you're building that company which is one reason and I'll go forward to this later that I think Benoan Koshan I get along because Benoan is a big thinking guy and he's built billion dollar companies and he tells his management team, are you building a hundred million dollar company or a billion dollar company? Because a lot of people will be happy to build a hundred million dollar company but he's gone out to build billion dollar companies. With the last company, Kallera, the vision was really to build a trillion dollar company in that case. If you're building a trillion dollar company then you're doing everything differently from the very beginning. You're not going off on little side markets or small opportunities. You're sticking to your gun and focusing on the big idea as you go forward. Well, Norian got into clinical trials and we had a 225-pacen prospect of randomized trial and we went to the FDA. We had international subsidiaries. I started in 87. This would be sort of 95-era. We were approved in many foreign countries, treating patients and having really, really good results. What we found at that time was that we could go out with this new technology. What we really had to do was train the customers and train them with a whole new paradigm. It wasn't just a product. We learned about the concept of really going out and selling the whole product to the customer and going to the operating room. We developed the concept of a new standard of care so that people could think about things completely differently. We went all the way back to when the person showed up at the emergency room. It wasn't just another box on the shelf in the operating room, but it was a whole new standard of care from the beginning to the end, the economics and everything. Stanford was very incremental. Important there as well. Amy and I are, I guess I can say, we're the same age. She looks about to say, she's the chief of orthopedics of hand surgery at Stanford and we grew up together and we treated all these cases and stored good men and a number of the surgeons here. We did studies and we published the New England Journal of Medicine, Orthopedics and all the best journals. I think we had over 200 peer-reviewed journal articles on what we did. That's how we really sold this idea and this concept, and included economics, included a lot of other things. In doing so, I learned another important lesson and I'm learning it over and over again. Anything I do, when you come up with crazy ideas, you have to gain credibility no matter how good the crazy idea is. What I've always done is assemble fantastic advisory boards. At Norean, I had an advisory board with the President of the Merri Academy of Surgery, the President of orthopedic Research Society, the most famous center of chronologists on the planet. People like that who could back up everything we're doing, work with us. Some of them would come in house and work with us for a long period of time. Another thing, and this would probably be the most valuable thing I learned in all these experiences, is I learned how to craft an operating plan for a company. This is a plan that's put together by the company with not just the classic mission, but objectives, goals, goals that have lives of three or four years and under each goal. There would be milestones with a date and an action that we would accomplish every quarter. In every quarter, I take most of the company off-site and we make a new, quarterly operating plan. Then we'd stop planning and go do it. It's been in all my companies, incredibly effective, in terms of accomplishing things and moving things fast and having everyone bought into it and a sunny accountability to everybody. An operating plan ended up being a very important thing. Norean teed up their S1 in 1996. When a company gears up to go public, especially in the days that we have now with Sarbanes Oxley, you can't be a startup anymore. You're going to be living in a completely different world. Everything about a company changes when you try and take it into a public arena. Norean ended up getting acquired. Something that happens when you tee up a public offering is you're right for acquisition. You have a lot of cash in the bank and you've got a great company that happens. That's when I came over here to Stanford. I had another thing happen at that time. My oldest son was diagnosed with cancer. It was a good time for me to be here on campus because he was at Lucille Packard. I was here for six months or so and I got together with the heart surgeon. Tom Fogarty, who some of you might know, he's a vascular surgeon here, Benedict Fogarty catheter, Paul Yacht, who invented the rapid exchange catheter. Within a few days and a lot of the other people in the community, we put a company together because they were having issues with another really big problem in cardiovascular medicine, which was the calcification, the mineral growth on heart valves and arteries. You probably heard of calcified arteries. Most of the amputations every year of people's legs, for example, are from calcified arteries that they can't re-vascularize. It didn't take long to come up with the big idea and the big idea was, well, let's do what bone itself does. There are specialized cells and bone that dissolve through it. The mineral that forms in bone actually is very similar to bone mineral. We devise, with the leaders in the field, some of the most sophisticated catheters probably ever designed with incredible plumbing to go into a total occlusion of the femoral artery. Calcified aortic valves. We had an open heart procedure where when the heart was stopped, we could decalsify the aortic valve or when we even had a beating heart approach. So while the heart was beating, we could decalsify the aortic valve. That company just got funded right away and we were off and running. Really grew into it very quickly. Quite a company. We had heart lung machines in the lab where we would bring in hearts and decalsify them and do the whole procedure and get it going. It got acquired very quickly. What happened with my son during that time is he was declared cancer free and then the cancer came back and it was clear he was going to die and he died in June of 2000. Johnson and Johnson ended up buying the company and making a part of a cordist. But that's when I really had one big inspiration. It was clear he wasn't going to live. One of the things I wanted him to do was to go diving on a coral reef. We did a lot of things before he died and that was one of the things. I realized at that time, it's not just my son who's not going to see a coral reef. It's all our children. Most of you in the audience, your children are never going to see a coral reef. The coral reefs are changing today. I have trouble finding coral reefs worth diving on today compared to my experience diving all over the world using submarines. That's how fast the climate is changing today. It's not just the aesthetic value of seeing a coral reef. It's the actual implications for what we were doing in our life. At that point, I was really in my career, a medical guy. I knew at that time that I had a strong inspiration to do something environmentally. I was approached by a number of the employees from my first company who really didn't like working for a billion-dollar company. They said, come on, man, you got another company. Let's go do it. It turned out I'd thought up some chemistry that was better than the first company cement. One of the things I did with this is we got the team. We got the band back together. We got one of the old buildings we'd been in, took our old offices. It was a stunning experience. We got together in August by Christmas. Let's see, it was 2002 by that point. We had our formulation. By New Year's, we'd done animal surgeries and put this cement in animals. By Valentine's Day, we'd made an FDA application with our data. By Memorial Day, we had FDA approval. By the 4th of July, the FDA had come in and inspected our manufacturing facility. We were shipping product to hospitals in less than a year, which is a record for any kind of medical product. Interestingly, with that company, prior to the first two companies which had been venture capital funded, and when you take venture capital money in Silicon Valley, you need to understand that the game is all set up for the venture capitalists, not for the entrepreneurs, because if you're a lawyer and you have a law firm here, you might see that entrepreneur three or four times at the most in your life. You're going to see that venture capitalists every week. All the documents are written for venture capitalists. I played that game twice. I don't want to play it again. My third company, I just put, actually, it wasn't even a C corporation. It was what we call an LLC. Everybody were members. Funded ourselves. Got checks from the famous orthopedic surgeons. We're selling products and we're profitable with no outside investment, no professional investors very soon. It was an enjoyable experience. The main thing about it was there was only one person on the board, not with me, and we always got along. There was never any controversy. It's kind of a sad thing, but board of directors debilitate companies. It's not intended, but the reality of the situation is if you have a board meeting every month, your management team is going to spend a day or two just preparing for the board meeting. Then they're going to spend a day or two just recovering from the board meeting. Typically most venture capitalists are on more than one board. Even though you send out the board package, stays ahead of time, FedEx and all that, they show up at the board meeting, opening the board package, make a lot of shoot from the hip decisions, and then at the next board meeting they ask you, well, why did you make that decision? It literally takes about 20% of the management teams time. What I learned in that one company is by not having a board and by actually being able to be fast so and operate quickly, you've just gained 20% of your time. You've lowered everyone's stress level a lot and you're allowed to pursue your original vision. That's what we were able to do there. It was successful. I made more money off that company than the other two combined, and I still am. It's all over the world. It's an operating room. It's a better product than the first product than they're competing. If there's no competition, generate your own. That was a great company. It was acquired and I ran it under the new company as CEO until I came back over here to Stanford. At that point, I was going to retire for sure. I still had this aching desire to do something on the environment. Through interactions with the Woods Institute, I learned that the production of cement was the third largest source of anthropogenic CO2. The first is tailpipes from cars, mainly, but the maritime industry and airlines. Second is the production of electrical power by burning fossil fuels, mainly coal. The third is the production of Portland cement, which is the cementing component of concrete. One thing about concrete is it's one of the largest markets, if not the largest market. It's in the trillions of dollars. Half of all building materials are concrete. Concrete is the most traded material other than water in the whole world. The concrete stops flowing. The whole economy stops. It happened here in Northern California in 1978. Everything is set down. If you look at the 28 billion or so tons that humans put into the atmosphere of CO2 every year, about 3 billion of those tons come from the production of Portland cement. It's interesting that it seemed quite easy to me to just produce a different type of cement that wouldn't produce CO2. That really didn't take long for me to come up with that and file the patents because that already made lots of different types of cement. I got hold of my old buddy Vinod Koshlin. I'd heard he was working in the clean tech space. We put a company together real quickly without a business plan. Kallera, which has raised somewhere near $200 million, has never written a business plan. What I'd like to say about business plans is number one, the only people that read them are your competitors. Number two, there's the only thing that's never going to happen. It's like when I play golf, I tell my partners, if you want to be safe, go stand near the flag because I'm never going to get it. Kallera is an exciting company which has a bouquet of opportunities that could really impact the world at this time. We set off and we had a lab of about eight ladies. I say that because I was the only male employee for some reason. We were making cement within about six months and Vinod was over there one day and we noticed that our limiting raw material was carbon dioxide. As for Vinod, where can I get some carbon dioxide? I wasn't aware. I just wasn't aware. I was involved with deep sea coral projects with Rob Dunbar here and looking at the ocean over the last 10,000 years and all that. I just wasn't aware that people were really interested in actively sequestering CO2. I thought immediately, gee, if you did this, you could make cleaning up the environment a prosperous activity. It wouldn't be a tax or a negative thing that no one's going to want to do or governments have to force people to do. It's something people do because they're going to make money doing it. If you could take CO2 as a raw material and make stuff out of it, well, then you wouldn't have to go mine a bunch of limestone and put it in kilns and create CO2. So it'd be a two for you to avoid the CO2 going to the atmosphere but also displace the CO2 that would have been created by making Portland cement. One of the interesting strategic aspects of Calera and it goes back to some of the earlier discussions about do you do your founding vision? Do you look at other opportunities? They come up. Today, there's no price on carbon. Not in the United States where the only country in the world doesn't have a price on carbon. But even if we did have a price on carbon, what if it was $10 a ton? We can sell a ton of cement for $100 a ton. And for every ton of CO2 that we capture, we can make two tons of cement. So the economics, the prosperous thing that will induce the Chinese and the Indians to do this, is actually works very well based on a profitable product. Now I'm in favor of carbon legislation. I'm very glad AB32 has stuck up and we're going to get that because the way California goes is the way the world goes with regard to carbon legislation. But the fact is that the fundamental economics of thinking about climate change don't make any sense to me. Professor Sokoloff at Princeton says we have to mitigate about 7 billion tons of CO2 a year. And he has seven wedges, renewables, energy efficiency, and how we're going to do that. And we're not anywhere close to doing that. But of the 28 billion tons of CO2 were putting in the atmosphere, we're thinking we want to mitigate 7 billion tons. We'll remember three billion tons can be mitigated just by replacing Portland cement with one of my semets. So that's half the wedge. The way we're thinking about it, and this really came through in Copenhagen where it was the rich world holding their wallet and the developing world asking to be paid not to pollute. Chinese say they need about $100 a ton, not to pollute. And say we need to mitigate 10 billion tons. 10 billion times $100 is a trillion. So you can talk to your blue in the face that let's pay the Chinese not to pollute. But it doesn't matter, there's not a trillion dollars a year to pay the Chinese not to pollute. You know, we'd have to borrow the money from them and pay them, and they don't even have that much to loan us. So the fundamental concept of cap and trade just doesn't work. But the concept of being able to induce people economically to create a green economy by creating prosperous activities that also make a clean environment is huge. There's other fantastic aspects to what Kalarah is doing. When you make concrete, about 20% of the concrete is cement. The other 80% is what we call aggregate. And aggregate is rock. And here in Northern California, we get about 60% of our aggregate from British Columbia. It's barged down because there are not enough quarries here. And it has to be mine. It's actually limestone. It's very similar to the Kalarah cement itself. It's a carbonate. It contains carbon. Most of the carbon on the planet is not in the atmosphere. It's not in the oceans. It's in the lithosphere in the form of limestone, like 99% of all the carbon on the planet is sitting in limestone on the planet. And the way you make Portland cement is you calcine limestone, which releases that CO2. But Kalarah also has the potential to go beyond that three billion tons by replacing Portland cement. And taking some of the nine billion tons that coal-fired power plants put in and doing that. To preventing an enormous amount of mining, which, whether you realize it or not, how much coal do you think's mined every year? About five billion tons. And it's almost all shaft mining. How much rock do you think's mined every year? About 40 billion tons. Yeah, about seven times as much. And it's all open pit mining. And it's environmentally destructive and non-sustainable. So it's a very, very interesting part of everything that's going on. But as I've worked through this, I've also learned how challenging climate change is going to be. I mean, the big idea that Kalarah can do the whole thing is there. The technology is going to have to be developed. And it's worth sticking to it. But the company has to decide, do we take some of the near term opportunities, work in countries where there is a price on carbon, for example? And just do carbon mitigation or just make cement, make money doing that. There's a lot of interesting strategic questions that Kalarah has in front of it today. But no matter how you look at it, the challenge for our grandchildren is phenomenal. Half of India is under the age of 14, and coal is their source of electricity. China is building more wind power than anybody. But coal is their source of electricity. Here in the United States, it's 51% of our electricity. If we went full bore with all the renewables we could, it might be 49% in 20 years. So our future, whether we wanted or not, involves coal. And that means there's going to be a lot of CO2. And part of the thinking today is, we better start looking at adaptation. Not that we've lost the battle, not that we shouldn't keep trying. And hopefully, Kalarah is extraordinarily successful. But we really need to look at adaptation. Instead of paying the Chinese to build windmills in Western China that aren't connected to anything because they're getting clean development mechanisms to do that. And they're just spinning and delivering electricity to nobody. Maybe we should be building seawalls in Bangladesh before millions of people are displaced. With Kalarah, especially I've had an opportunity to meet a lot of interesting people. We've had coal and pow, Tony Blair out, Hank Poulson. Bill Gates, a lot of interesting folks. Something everyone realizes is the daunting size of climate change and the political implications of what could happen. If you look at the Hindu Kush and the Himalaya glaciers, A to the rivers flowing out feed a third of the world's population, their water. And whether you believe in climate change or not, those glaciers are going. And the Chinese are having to decide right now between hydro power and drinking water today. And it's not going the other way. It's not a seasonal fluctuation. And so if you think about, what are the main things that our grandchildren are going to have to deal with with regard to adaptation, what are they? Well sea level rise, I can imagine that. In Bangladesh, it's hard to imagine. That'll be devastating. But most of the world I can imagine that, dealing with that. The biggest thing is probably going to be drought. Mark Twain said, what do you say? People pay money for whiskey, but they go to war over water. And so I've become extremely interested in water. We had a project in Australia, one of the dirtiest coal-fired power plants funded by the state of Victoria, where we will be producing fresh water at a site 110 kilometers inland that's been in drought for over a decade. From the brine water we take up to combine with the flue gas. And become more and more interested in it. And even locally, Calera has their plant down on Monterey Bay here at Moss Landing. And we have a permit to pump about 60 million gallons of seawater a day into our demo plant down there. And being really, a lot of my background is in oceanography. I used to deep dive and take submarines down and collect corals and all that. I know that the deepest submarine canyon in the whole world comes right in at Moss Landing. And it's where the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute is. And it has the clearest, freshest, deep water close into shore anywhere in the world. And one problem we have here in California is we need about a million gallons of water, at least. I mean, sorry, a million acre feet of water, just about a million gallons a day. So we've been unable to permit a lot of coastal desalination plants because of the concern of taking organisms from the top of the ocean. And we're in a tough spot. But being oceanographer, I know that if you go down to the depths where only one percent of the light at the surface exists, there's no chlorophyll. Because there's no photosynthesis going on. And then there's no not much life, not much with food chain. So we have the sun believable opportunity I'm pursuing right now to go out deep into the canyon, Monterey Canyon. On to a site I've been operating for a few years now with 200 acres of infrastructure and permits and pipes added to the canyon and provide, hopefully initially 10,000 acre feet of water to Monterey County and Santa Cruz County. And a local project, which for me is really a blast because I've only worked on international products that have gone everywhere and to do something locally has been really fun for me. And I'm really excited about the work we're doing. And the water we're going to produce is going to have a much lower carbon footprint than any other form of desalinating water because we're starting with very pure water. And we have the other problems that groundwater has like Chrome 6 and other things like that. So that's been an exciting project that I've gotten going. But I could say a lot but I've exceeded my 40 minutes so I better cut it off. Well, we have time now for questions from the audience. But as we normally do, we're going to ask Heidi Roison to ask the first question on behalf of the Spirit of Entrepreneurship class. Thank you very much. That's fantastic. One of the students who takes the class remotely, who's probably watching right now, I feel a little question online. And so we picked that question this week to launch for you. We talk a lot about entrepreneurship and company formation all of that. And this student was really curious about the fact that you said that Calera in one month you brought 40 people on board. I think it was Calera. Now I'm thinking that maybe it was the company before that given what you just described. How in the world did you bring 40 people on board at once and how did you build a culture around bringing that many people into the world? Yeah. Well, that happened at Calera for sure a few months in a row because we went through it. I mean, you have to understand Calera is just about three years old and it's already got quite a management team. But we've always really just gone back to that earlier principle that I told you about is just kill ourselves to get the very, very best people you can get. And you know, you need management that can sell snow to ask you know. And you got to have people drinking the cool lights. So if you identify someone who you want. You know, this sounds kind of mean, but I think with the note it's almost the challenge to me. You know, I mean, for notes I bet you can't recruit that person. And we've been able to recruit anybody. I mean, anybody. Great. So what about questions from others in the audience? Who's got a question? Yes, over here. Speak really loud. So like when, for example, entrepreneurs come and like say they have like an idea and they want to bring a product to the market. Most of the time from when I've read and when I've heard nothing about I want to make a lot of money off this. They just say, oh, I want to change the world, for example. And I have this really great idea and I can, I've got a really great solution to this problem, which is unmet right now. But in like the practical sense, once they start to sort of see the venture capital side and the money capital side, they sort of have to say like, is this feasible? You know, is this financially responsible to create this problem? So how much, like at sort of at what point do you look at the financial implications of the product that you created to change the world, but now might not be financially. Right, it's possible. Well, you know, there's the real world and then there's Silicon Valley. And I think with my third company, I learned a lot about just building a business with your own money, you know, and not sending your goals too high. If I notice one common fault in everything I've done, it's that I've set my goals too high, which is great, you know, if you want to go build that trillion dollar company. But it's a lot easier to fail. And I think, you know, choosing something that you know is doable, that you can go out and get accomplished without having to raise an enormous amount of capital and tell a fantastic story is a good way to go as well. I remember with Nory and the first company, they said, well, you know, it's going to take you $50 million and five years to go through prospective randomized multi-center trials and orthopedic surgery. But you know what, there's more root canals than there are hip fractures. And we could make $15 off each root canal. And we can get FDA approval for that in 90 days. You know, and so let's become a root canal company. And so we wasted about a year and a bunch of money to do parodontal defects. And it was a total waste of time, you know, dentist pay for things with our credit cards. You know, it just wasn't what you wanted to do. So it's a constant tension. It's true to really get these guys managing these big funds to invest in something. You better have just a big story with a fantastic return on investment. And that's really different than the way most people start businesses. You know, I'm learning that in Monterey, we're forming a joint powers authority with the local water districts, floating a municipal bond to fund the building of $100 million or D cell plant, working with local banks. It's a completely different story. And I think it's possible for entrepreneurs to work outside of the Silicon Valley environment. You know, don't hire a Silicon Valley lawyer. As soon as you hire Silicon Valley lawyer, your company is set up for venture investment. And that's the road you're going. And I'm not saying don't. I'm just saying that's the direction you're going to go. Okay, great. Right over here. You talked about your ability to recruit people and recruit top talent. Then you also talked about your displeasure kind of frustration with having a board of directors. But would you say that having a board of directors is also pretty helpful in attracting top talent. And I was born to kind of what your thoughts were. Not having a board. And if you ever face disadvantage there. I haven't had that experience. You know, I sometimes you can use a board member to help recruit people. And especially if you're a weak at recruiting people, then the board could recruit the whole team around you. And that might be a strategy. But generally, when I identify somebody that I want to bring in, I'll screen them through my entire management and let them do their homework on us. And then when we've decided who we're going to hire, then we'll give them the opportunity to meet members of the board of directors. I think a board can be valuable, but a board can also be disastrous, depending how it works. I guess the point is when the company puts up risk factors, you know, the technology won't work. We'll run out of money. The management won't get along. All the things that can kill a company. And especially one of the top three or four things is always we'll have board instability and that'll kill the company. Great. Right over here? Yep. You talked about how you didn't figure out that carbon dioxide could be sequestered until later on in your process. You also talked about how the first inspiration for you to go that route was to try to find a green resolution to the telephone. So how did you plan before that or did you just kind of happen upon this? Just replacing Portland cement without sequestering CO2 from some other source. Not using Portland cement and using something else that didn't produce CO2 would reduce the annual anthropogenic CO2 by 3 billion tons, even if you never sequestered a single molecule of CO2. So the initial inspiration was just to replace Portland cement. Great. Okay. Actually wanted to ask a question about carbon trading. I was reading an article, Reddit Smith actually listed carbon as a commodity in the market. And there's a billion dollar trade going on in the company. Now, your technology plans to take away the carbon. Don't you see the market as a trade to your technology? I mean, there are people trading millions of dollars in that. Yeah, I mean, it's amazing. You know, the biggest supporters of Kyoto and also the treaties we're trying to get are actually British petroleum and these people because they actually saw they make more money trading carbon. It's spawning for installing oil. And so it's incredible. There's already carbon markets, you know, operating all over the world and the one in Europe really doesn't necessarily encourage anybody to stop polluting. There's a lot of ways around it. It's it's just fundamentally it grows out of the legal theory that polluters should clean up their mess. And the clean air act grew out of that. And the clean air act has been the most successful environmental legislation that I know of. And it works extremely well for say, so to. But so to is in the parts per million. And so you can pay people not to put so to the atmosphere. The problem is there's so much CO2. And there's so few alternatives that there's just not enough money to pay people to do that. You know, one of the things the US government is looking at and other governments is actually separating CO2 from blue gas and doing that would take about a third of the power of the plant of a coal plant just to separate it. And then paying companies like Hal Burton to transport it and paying other companies to inject it into the ground and other companies to monitor it for decades so that it won't leak out like happening that lake in Africa and kill the whole village of thousands of people in a few minutes. As a viable approach. And there's three billion dollars of stimulus money. They're being spent on that. And it could never even under the best scenario sequester more than a few hundred million tons a year for a few decades. And wouldn't have any effect on our grandchildren's life or anything. So yeah, I mean the manipulation of financial markets is almost unbelievable. And it really in my opinion isn't going to do anything for a grandchildren. Okay. Are you worried about competition? I hope there's confidence. And I mean people tell me, you know, the Chinese are going to rip off Claire. And I say great. More power to them. That would be the best thing for the world. First of all, there's plenty of CO2. I've learned by selling cement in China that you're not going to make any money in China anyway. And I gave a lecture to a group of Chinese executives from a province south of Shanghai recently. And they've already sort of started adopting the Clara process because it's so publicly known. If you go to Clara's website, Clara has over 200 patent applications that are published. There's nothing secret about Clara. You know, I really think the Clara is bigger than Clara Corporation, which is the Delaware Corporation that's been incorporated and funded. I think the concept, like I said originally about an avalanche, it's already out there. I can go, you know, I was at the COP 16 conference. People all over the world are aware that you can convert flu gas into carbonates, then transform them into aggregate and rock. There's a lot of trick in it. But I'm convinced that the only place to put the CO2, if we really want to mitigate CO2, is in the built environment on the surface of the earth where it's stable and it ain't going to go anywhere. And also bring the criteria pollutants and the other things. It's in my opinion, the most sensible, really only place to put it. And we've got the technology now. But I'm already aware of other technologies being developed for various parts of the Clara process that could be fit into it to make it even better. Super, over there. Your idea sounds truly great. And I think your company is really on track to change the world. And it's almost borrows on the fact that it's too good to believe that you can have the cake and eat it as well. And then I was reading it online. There's a lot of critics that say that your process is not really grounded on factual information and that you give big evidence. So how do you respond to criticism and say that your process is not scalable as well? It might not actually work. Well, I've been in the medical field and when you're in medicine, everyone's like, I hope you do it, man. I hope you make the world a better place. What I've learned is in the climate community, there's a lot of politics, there's a lot of academic people trying to get funding. Even the Gates Foundation, Bill Gates is a limited and he has money in Clara. And the advisors to the Gates Foundation, one of whom had started a blog about Clara, had set a lot of things. And the people that didn't have any basic skills in crystallography or making cement and really had no basis to make these claims. The part of the reason was they're operating a different paradigm. The paradigm they're operating in is let's separate the CO2 and eject it into the ground and then get paid by some government subsidy to do that. That's not the paradigm Clara is operating in. And the paradigm Clara is operating in is let's make cleaning up the environment, a prosperous activity that's profitable and not base whether it's feasible to scale on having a price on carbon. But base whether it's feasible to scale economically on will they buy the cement. And frankly, what's going to happen as a price of carbon comes on is the price of Portland cement is going to increase. Because for every ton of cement they sell, they're going to have to pay whatever that price is for the ton of CO2 they put out. So the price of cement is going to increase. The price of color cement is going to decrease half as much because it's half a ton of CO2 per ton is the color cement. And so it's only going to help Clara as a price of carbon comes on, but we're just not operating in the cap and trade paradigm when we do the economics of our plants. But also, Clara is three years old. It's incredible the amount of progress Clara has made in three years. And if I think whether it going to be in a year, two years or three years, a lot of the challenging problems will be even more interesting. But I think in funding this recent $45 million matching funds grant that was publicly announced from the Department of Energy to Clara, I think the DOE was really looking at all the alternatives and how economically scalable they'll be. Right, we'll take one more question. Right back there. Yep, speak really loud. So you're talking about how the big vision is important to maintain the initial vision for a company. It sounds like Clara's initial vision has to do with selling cement, those not Portland cement and is taking away CO2 from the environment. But what you're doing with water now is that undercolaire and does that fit in? Now it's just a new venture. The fact that we're doing it at Moss Landing, which is where the other Clara plan is, we're just right next door to each other. But I do think it can be expanded beyond Monterey Bay. Maybe Marin County, down the coast, really all over the world. There's a company called Water Standards that takes large ships out on the ocean and they put a straw down deep in the ocean to avoid the life in the top. And that way they're able to desalinate the way we're proposing on shipboard and then bring the ship to shore, pump the water on board. But one comment about that is, and Vinod always tells me companies that have their founders usually do better. And my wife pointed out there was an article in the San Jose Mercury over the weekend that said, you know, it pointed out how clearly companies with their founders are always more successful. And I think it's because someone needs to keep the vision. Great. On that note, I hope you'll join me in thanking Brent Bonson. Thank you.
