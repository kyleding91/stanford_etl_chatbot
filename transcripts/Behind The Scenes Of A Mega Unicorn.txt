 Who you are defines how you build. This is the Auditorial Thought Leaders Series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. Who you are defines how you build. Welcome Stanford and YouTube communities to the Stanford Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders seminar brought to you by STVP, the Entrepreneurship Engineering Center in the School of Engineering at Stanford, and basis the Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students. Today we are thrilled to have Austin Russell here to ETL. Austin is the 27-year-old founder and CEO of Lumenar. How many people have heard of Lumenar? Oh, fantastic. Okay. As many of you already know, Lumenar is a multi-billion dollar publicly traded company that makes Lidar sensors, hardware and software sensors for the automotive industry. Lidar, as you know, is an amalgamation of two words, light and radar. It is using photonics and optics for 3D visualization and analytics and intelligence. Now before I give Austin's formal introduction, let me explain why I am so excited to have Austin here with us today. As you as may know, the essence of entrepreneurship, the definition of entrepreneurship, comes from Harvard Business School Professor Howard Stevenson. He's generally the one that people use when they're siding academically. And he defines entrepreneurship as the pursuit of opportunity without regard for resources controlled. Or set another way. It's about pursuing opportunity unbridled by constraints where really the vision is your currency and your energy source to overcome obstacles that might be in your way. And true entrepreneurs can unlock locks and overcome challenges that others can't. And they're usually driven by a vision that transcends the obstacles in front of them. For me, Austin is a quintessential modern day entrepreneur. And it's not just because his pursuits are entrepreneurial. It's because his pursuits are deeply contrarian. And in the pursuit of that, the entrepreneurship side stands out in even starker relief. So let me just set the stage for that as I introduce Austin. Austin grew up in Southern California in Irvine. Or at Newport, New Border Irvine, yeah, exactly. Near Irvine. And actually started Luminar while he was in high school. Were you 16 or 17? Oh, yep, yep. 16. Then he gets admitted to Stanford in honor that many of you can relate with deeply. Comes to the farm, but drops out sort of three to six months into Stanford. He gets a till fellowship for 100K and he decides to stop out of Stanford. That alone is a momentous decision. I think many of you can understand the gravity of that. But what's more is is that Austin goes all in into one of the most unsexy spaces at the time. So he decides to pursue optics and photonics in 2012. So he's not stopping out to go after a sexy area that is sort of a foregone conclusion of success. He's not going to start a crypto company or even a software company. He's doing hardware and he's doing deep tech hardware, okay? It's classically the things that any mainstream VC would tell you to run for the hills and avoid. He also decides to do not just hardware, but it's capital intensive hardware. This first product with his first vision is going to cost him the tens of millions of dollars. It's not just a couple hundred thousand dollars to create an MVP or a white paper. There are deeply entrenched competitors. So I'm sure you guys are all familiar with the Google cars, with those flying buckets of LIDAR sensors, apples working on this. And he decides to go head to head with them. And he's 17. And he decides to drop out of Stanford. He doesn't have a PhD, let alone even a bachelor's degree. He fast-forward nine years later, in 2021, he's raised $450 million. The company has gone public and he has retained 33% ownership of the company. Just as comparison, if you look at other software companies or other young founders like Aaron Levy from Box, who did a classic software enterprise viral company, he has 5% of equity when he goes public after having raised similar amounts of money. And so not only has he built something that is deeply disruptive, he's also done it in a way where he's also retained significant ownership. So how did he do it? And how did he overcome the challenges and obstacles that many of you may have confronted along that journey? Well, those questions and more, hopefully we will answer in the next hour. So everybody, please welcome Austin. So Austin, let me give the floor to you, first of all, is there anything that you want to explain to people that don't know Lumenar about what Lumenar does? Well, I mean, from what you said, it sounds like a horrible idea. I don't want anyone in their right mind within a mile. No, but yeah, I think you give a little bit of the overview there, too. Obviously, it was quite a journey being able to get to the point. But in terms of the whole concept around Lumenar, the first place was to be able to create a new kind of breakthrough ground up system for Lidar, which is a central flight detection ranging. It's basically sort of the eyes of the autonomous car that sends out Lidar pulses in the environment to know exactly how far away things are measuring the speed of light, you know, you guys are familiar, if you're familiar. But basically, what we had to do was create something that would be for production vehicles that consumers could be able to utilize. And there's a lot of different contrarian, as you said, that's a lot of that we had to make along the way. But the ultimate goal and what we were able to achieve was to be able to build something that could dramatically enhance the driving experience, enhance the driver, as opposed to replacing the driver, and be able to work with now the majority of major global automakers to enable next generation safety and autonomous capabilities on their next generation vehicle lineups. So, yeah, working with automakers is not easy, but it's very incredibly rewarding when you're able to succeed at that. And that's really where I think we have an opportunity in our fortunately having the ability to change millions of lives along the way, the adopters of these vehicles, as it gets out there more and more so. But basically, for the first time, I think we're seeing this transformation in the autonomous vehicle space from all R&D into actual real production cars, and we're effectively spearheading that. And again, the important part is that it's not just about the self-driving part, it's also about the safety part. And in the holistic mission there is, and we can talk at some point about some of the longer-term vision, but the mission there is to be able to dramatically improve collision avoidance capabilities on vehicles, which sometimes people take for granted, but the reality is that the problem has never been worse, where more and more people, more and more cars are getting into more and more accidents, even despite all the technology advances that have happened on vehicles over the past couple of decades. So that's what we're really looking to be able to turn around and solve one of the leading causes of death globally and suffering. So that's an important part of it as well. And you articulate that in a vision statement. I want you to share what your vision statement is. And can you share how early on in the journey you crystallize that vision statement and what recommendations you have to other founders in terms of how important it is to articulate a vision and when they should put focused attention on that? Yeah, absolutely. And I would say the most recent iteration of this, and this is from coming from a few years ago, basically we have this 100-year vision for what's laid out. And the 100 vision is to save as many as 100 million lives and 100 trillion hours of people's time not on the road over the next 100 years. And every single thing that we do as a company all adds back up towards that vision. And I think it's just really important of you're going to have amazing days as an entrepreneur, you're going to have horrible days that you wish you didn't exist. And you're going to have to go always back to that holistic mission and meaning for not just yourself but that whole team around what are we actually doing? What's inspiring in terms of the greater purpose around what we're building and why it's there? And I think the more inspiring of a holistic mission that you can have, the better a talent that you're going to be able to attract, the more impact you're going to have. And I think just frankly, there's going to be just a lot more satisfaction with everything that you do. It doesn't always have to start out so grandiose. It can even just be as the first part is just make the best light on, make the best technology. You can have, even that in itself was ambitious enough because we're basically competing with the Googles and apples and every major automaker and every major tier one and other folks there. But then at some point you just have to keep building and building and building on top of that until you can kind of have this bigger picture holistic mission that everything can roll up under and everything that you do. And I think identifying that as early on as possible, whatever that may be, is absolutely critical to the success of a new company that's looking to create talent up against incumbents that just don't have that same kind of direction. So I just want to underscore that. So even at the very beginning you did have, I don't know if you articulated it as a vision, but you had a focus statement that was critical. Is that right? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. And I think it was, it was that it was, you know, make autonomy safe and ubiquitous. And then, you know, we ultimately crystallized it to that 100-year vision. But even when you were a Stanford student, you were about to drop out. Even at that stage of the company you had a... Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely. 100%. And so can you take us back? So I want to ask the question that's sort of the elephant in the room for all of our aspiring entrepreneurial Stanford students is, what advice would you give to the Stanford students that are wrestling with whether or not they should drop out of Stanford and pursue something entrepreneurial? How do they know if it's the right decision or the wrong decision? That's a good question. And the reality is that there is no single right decision or single wrong decision for everything. And I think it's the same thing that even Peter Teal said, you know, when he was first convincing me or some of the other Teal fellows that had joined with and dropping out, is that it's... If you know that timing is important in terms of pursuing a journey or an idea or a concept or something that you have, it's not going to wait for you. It's not going to... Sometimes you just really have to capitalize on opportunities that are there then. Like, if the reality is that if I had waited until, you know, for example, like in this specific case, like, graduate, I'd probably would have had, I'd probably have like a PhD probably right around now, you know, to in terms of what... We probably would have graduated from this field and it would be way too late to try and pursue anything in this field. Like, it would already be completely dominated by a host of other players. So, sometimes timing is very important. The other part is just... I think you have to be able to succeed in a few different dimensions and a few different personality traits. I think there's three very specific things that have to intersect at the same time and that's curiosity, drive, and passion. All three of those things have to come together at the same time. You're missing any one of those things. You can't be successful at an entrepreneur. So, I think that, but when that does come together and it's something that you really believe in and frankly is like I said, other people believe in and your customers believe in too or will believe in for that matter, then there's really no reason why you can be successful, independent, like you can be at school, you can not be at school, that's all good. But I think on balance, I will say that Stanford is, you know, one of the realistically, you know, foremost, at probably being at the forefront of all this and encouraging the entrepreneurship and the right kind of environment to be able to foster exactly that. So I think like probably any academic environment that is like generally good for fostering that kind of thinking and mentality, like it's certainly here. And so just to make this clear, how are you feeling when you've made the decision to drop out, was there fear, did you have any fear about that decision, was there gravity on that decision or did it feel pretty easy and natural? No, super easy and natural. Super easy and natural. No, no, no. There was no consternation. Not at all. Austin's dad's in the audience and your parents didn't say, I don't know. Oh, that's a different one. Yeah, my dad isn't telling you too. I'm looking at that. Yeah, it was definitely different kind of discussion that's happening there. I think the thing is that if you don't, you need to have an extreme amount of conviction in whatever you're doing. If you don't get over that barrier, you're not going to be able to make it into the room. So you really have to be confident in what you're doing to be successful. Frankly, even if you're blissfully ignorant and confident in there too, if you have enough confidence, then it's amazing what you can do. So let's talk about how you source that conviction because it does feel very clearly that you had this clear conviction that you would miss out on the opportunity if you didn't take action then. But so many people at the time, if you were looking at doing something that was deeply technical, it's going to cost tens of millions of dollars to build. How did you have enough, what was required for you to put the dots together to say that the timing is now for me to focus on optics and photonics in 2012 to have the conviction to actually go all in. So I would just say for optics and photonics generally. And by the way, I think the timing actually still is now. I think the timing is for the next couple of decades for that matter. Like, I'm a firm believer that I sort of saw a theme and had a thesis that what electronics was to the 20th century optics and photonics and optoelectronic would be to the 21st century. The terms of just major innovations and iterations and problems being solved at global scale that can deliver massive amounts of value. And saw that as also like the clears path to be able to make sort of a global change and also make a lot of money while doing it at the same time. So I think when it comes down to it, being able to identify broader themes is really interesting way and just sort of these trends that and it's not going to be the stuff that everybody's talking about. Frankly, a lot of times like if everybody's talking about it, then it's probably like over. Like, you're going to have a lot of competition. You're going to have a lot of different people focused on things like you want to find niches to be able to start off with that are specific. Now in this case, like optoelectronics in and of itself a niche. But it's different in the sense that for example, like most major, I mean talk about universities, like most major universities, like you have like electrical engineering programs, you have computer science programs, you have other things like photonics programs. You don't like, there's no 99.9% of schools don't have, like you can't graduate as an undergrad in photonics, you know, that's not even a thing. So like to actually Stanford's like one of the foremost, you know, experts on that, you know, or generally in terms of the level of talent that's had here. And even then that's like almost pretty much entirely the graduate school. So you know, it's just interesting to see those dynamics. And the important part is, I think, is seeing interdisciplinary connections and just being able to actually ensure that it's applied to the real world. And that there is a practical application of that kind of product or technology or whatever it is that you're building, as opposed to just doing say research for the sake of research, which I think is still a little bit of a struggle with the academic community, which nevertheless is extremely important, you know, for the fundamentals of everything that's done. But I think you can all benefit from more entrepreneurship. Okay. So it sounds like you connected the dots between the potential and the markets. It captured your passion, your curiosity and your drive. And so that was enough for you to commit your one precious life to this at Stant, when you're to drop out and go full time on this all in. When was the moment when the other words, Yolo? Yolo. Yolo. Back back when that was that term was cool. Yeah. By dating myself. Younger generation. But when was the moment then that you actually knew that you would succeed? When the product actually was going to realize the vision that you had mentally and be a market success? And how did you get that? I mean, I sort of like, I mean, maybe this has got a crazy title. It's like, it's had a lot of conviction that it was going to be successful. We're going to have to make it work. I think, you know, for what it's worth, like as an entrepreneur, you sort of have to take the mentality that like failure is not an option, you know, and a Apollo style where, no matter what you do, like you have to succeed, you have to make this work. So like if you're going all in on something, you have to do that in a very, very intelligent capacity. And I think kind of like that, you know, that Warren Buffett saying, like, don't put all, don't put all of your eggs in a bunch of different baskets, put it all in one basket and watch that basket very carefully. So yeah, in this case, like you have to build, you know. And I think I would say probably like, I don't know within the first year of sort of what I was doing there too. I, you know, I didn't know the full extent of what, you know, it could do and what it could ultimately mean by like any stretch of the imagination. But I knew that it was valuable. I knew it was impactful. And frankly, like when you're in a technology ecosystem and you can build valuable technology, like it's amazing how much interest you can get from like, you know, from potential, you know, customers in this case, automakers, technology companies, other stuff, people want to, you know, people want to buy technology from you, people will probably want to even buy your holistic company if it really is that breakthrough. So, you know, if you can build the right breakthrough tech in the first place and get that product market fit, that makes all the difference. I just want people to get a good feel for the difference between great and good. You're the youngest self made billionaire for a reason. And so I want them to understand what does validation feel like when you're in one of these, you know, mega unicorns. So I understand, it sounds like from day one, you had 100% conviction that it was going to succeed. But there was a moment when maybe you could relax a little bit because you had the external validation that was going to succeed. Can you give us any more tactical detail on what numbers you were sensitive to that gave you that validation? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, and we, like I said, we raised obviously a lot of capital and other stuff along the way. I mean, I would say though that the true validation never, like, you never get 100% true validation until very, very late in the end, like probably like 10 years. And maybe that's when you get like started to get your true validation for it. But I mean, the reality is is that different steps along the way, I would say like the first sort of major iteration of the product of like, you know, the first time when we had everything come together with the lidar, you know, flipped on the switch and everything can actually image, you know, and it can work as it you would expect it to work. And you know, your theoretical calculations match up with the real world. Like those are the moments that's like the mind blowing moments, you know, at the same time, it's like the first moment when we came out of stealth mode, we were actually we had no press, no interviews, no public website, no anything for the first five years of the business. That was that. Would you recommend that by the way, because it sort of goes against its another contrarian move, which people would say lets fumble towards victory, iterate, you release and then mention and talk and interact with the market frequently so that you get feedback. You went into deep stealth for five years. Yep. Was that the right decision? Absolutely. Like 100%. I mean, honestly, like, I think the distinction is that if you, we kind of have jokingly had to say that we had to find 2000 ways to not build a lidar before finding the way that would actually solve the problem for all these different dimensions and everything of what it takes to be able to make this happen. And you want to do that behind closed doors. Like you want to be able to make sure in a world of where everyone is always, you know, over promising and under delivering like in, you know, the startup B or a hype sphere. Like you, there is value in under promising and over delivering or frankly just not promising literally anything at all like hence, you know, being deep in stealth mode. But then when you do have that and when you're ready to be able to show it off, I mean, I think it was like literally the first time that we launched out of stealth mode, you know, next thing you know, you have, like just breakneck interest from every one of the customers side to, I mean, I think we're, you know, getting these like huge features from like Bloomberg and the New York Times and like, how do you overcome the criticism which is like the classic customer development trend over the last decade that, you know, you want to get outside of the business, interact directly with your end customers and iterate quickly. And you can do that too. And still be in stealth. Absolutely. You can do that and still be in stealth. It's very good. You know, everybody has, everybody's properly NDA, everybody, like make sure you have the right, the right frameworks for things. But you can operate in stealth and do all of those things. Like there's, and in fact, I think actually like there's some element. I mean, in this case, we were, I mean, talk about like other unconventional things. Like we were, I have this network of like hacker houses, you know, called like it was almost, it was very Silicon Valley show, that I used to be part to be able to fund the business. And one of them was actually this compound on the top of the hill in Portola Valley, actually, just like 10 minutes up the road here. And that was one where it was like, that was actually where we would like live and work out of and just be able to build these kind of different products and systems. And it was like such a different, it was like you would just enter a completely different universe when you would come into it. And it was almost isolated from the rest of like reality of like the dimensions and the strengths of what's possible. And it was like you didn't, you didn't have to worry about anything, the noise, didn't have to worry about any of this stuff and you just focus on what you need to do. And that, that focus part, I think it goes back to is, is definitely critical. But it's all those things that add up that, that make a difference. And so I want to dive into some of the creative things that you did because even if you have the conviction, you know it's right, being a 17 or 18 year old kid needing to raise, you ended up raising $450 million. But even raising your first money, even if you know that you're right is a challenge. It's a challenge even for people that have a much deeper pedigree under their belts when they go into VC funds. Can you talk about the creative ways in which you got financing? Obviously, the Peter Teal check was 100K. It's great, but it's not enough to build an X Gen liner system. And how did you get financing and any unintuitive tactics that you use that you would share with others? Yep, yep. And by the way, for what is worth, I think, by the time we're done, it's probably well over a billion and a half dollars in terms of total financing. A billion and a half to just... Can you share what percentage of the company you still own? Yeah, about a third. About a third. I think that's unprecedented. In my 20 years of venture. Okay, so spill. I mean, you're the insides of how do the 17-year-old get your initial funding, any unintuitive tactics or how to keep you in? Oh, yeah. There's a lot. And there's a lot of craziness, too, like this is... Oh, man. So yeah, first and foremost, the reality is that raising money, particularly in the early stages of business, is extremely dilutive. Money is always the most expensive, so to say, in the early stages, by orders of magnitude. Actually, you know what's really... It's really funny. So it was just there with... Actually, here we are in the Jensenwong Auditorium here, too. Just a couple hours ago, or a few hours ago earlier to say we announced this big deal with Mercedes alongside Envidia, which was a fantastic outcome and expanding across their whole lineup of vehicles for the next generation technology that we're building on it. And actually, it was there with Jensenwong, you know, so funnily enough. And it was like, oh, well, speaking of your auditorium later, hey? So that's... That was pretty cool. And it's so weird, by the way, too, like being here, like when I was in the audience, like 10 years ago, you know, too, taking a look at some of these talks and other things, like kind of coming full circle. But the thing that I remember Jensen saying here, just a couple hours ago, was that he... The big thing that he wanted to do, the first thing he did when he... IPO'd was he wanted to buy his parents' Mercedes. And I think it was like a $50,000 Mercedes that he... And they're buying for it and he's like, that was the most expensive Mercedes ever, because that now... He's like, it didn't math and now that's the equivalent of a $200 million Mercedes, you know, based on the current value of where Envidia is at. So, you know, it goes to show like, point is, is that if you believe in long-term growth trajectory, you know, you can like, money is very, very expensive. But in the early stages... He spent that $50,000 at the beginning of the company, is that... Yeah, towards the beginning. So he could've had that... So he could've had that too. Like, order the magnitude growth, if he held on to it instead of selling that portion of stock from it, you know, would've been, you know, $200 million. That was the joke about the $200 million Mercedes. But the point is, is that I think that the early on, it's very important to try and be creative and thoughtful about how you finance. And, you know, one of the things that the strategies that I took early on, is because we had so much conviction in terms of long-term value about what we could create. And this, I think, like, safe notes in particular, is a certain mechanism of financing that was originally started by a Y-combinator and proliferated throughout. It was... How do we say? Much more niche and much smaller scale there too. Like, people would do, like, $10,000 safe notes, $50,000 safe notes, maybe $100,000 safe notes. The reason for these notes, instead of operating off of traditional equity finance things, where people give you a certain amount of money for a certain percentage of the company, was basically, you would be able to, in exchange for either getting a higher valuation cap or getting a discount off of a future round, be able to effectively push out when that mark to market is on valuation. And, from a discounting perspective, even if you basically are saying, X Investor, I guarantee you will get a 30% return by giving you a 30% discount or... a plus or minus, whatever it may be. Which, by the way, is, like, for most investors, like, you know, those kinds of returns are, like, really good. But if you think that you're going to, like, 10X and, like, grow by 1,000%, like, 30% is, like, completely in the noise. So, you know, that's where you can be creative around these things. And that's... So, we took a mechanism that, you know, normally people raise, like, 100K on. And over the years, they raised $200 million on safe notes. Which, I think, I think... I've never heard of that. It's seemingly a streamed data point, everybody. But it's an example of your entrepreneurial thinking. Yeah. So, yeah. So, technically speaking, technically speaking, we actually, before going public, only ever did one equity financing, because it all all the notes sort of converged together. And in that first year when you're just starting with the monies, the most difficult to raise, how much of it was funded by the hacker house? I mean, most of it. So, when did you get your first outside check outside of... So, you guys understand the hacker house, he rented a big house, he sub-leased the rooms, and he made a margin off of that. And he also created this community that was also a competitive advantage. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, it turns out the ultimate form of due diligence on people is living with them. So, you ended up getting your cash from the hacker house talent, and also tech development. Absolutely. Yeah, no. And people were like so excited to live with it. Literally, the market rate for what people were bidding on for a closet, which was around $2500 per month, for literally a closet in the hacker. Like, it was crazy. Like, in terms of people were coming up with creative ideas for how can they just... People want to be a part of the community. And it was just wild to see early on just how much of... Well, literally wild west type mentality was it. But there was a lot of civility there too at the same time. It's not like the movies in that sense. But that was your cash for the first... how many months? Like, is that for the first... Or the first, like, you know, year or two. And then you got your outside capital from... A couple years from... yeah, safe. Okay. Yeah, and then started to get outside capital and say started compiling that on. And I think, you know, as you progress yourself, you can mark up evaluation counts. You can, you know, you don't have to give people as big a discount. You can do other things. But, yeah, it makes a difference. But the point is that, like, even by shifting out delusion, like a year or two on things that literally can make all the difference. I mean, you guys are familiar with exponential scales on things. If you, like, even slight changes in terms of the timing of when that delusion happens, just makes, like, dramatic differences in the total outcome of what can happen from an ownership stake perspective. Like, to the point is that the reality is that most of the time, I mean, to end up with, like, a 5% stake, for example, by the time you go public. I mean, you, people end up deluding themselves, like, 20 times over. I mean, it's actually a lot of new shares that you just have to constantly issue an issue. An issue, an issue, an issue, an issue, an issue. And that can be very challenging. So, the key thing though is that it's not just about, and this is a very, very important point. It's not just about the honor, like, for example, as an entrepreneur, it's not just about the ownership stake that you have. It's about all of the other employees that you have. You dilute, like, yes, you get diluted on something. But, like, if you bring more shares and you do more financing, more delusion, then it dilutes everybody else along with you. So, you know, what you want is to be able to end up in a virtuous cycle of value growth with your employees rather than a vicious cycle of value growth, where you then have to issue more shares to then make up for that value. So, and were the safe cap then, or was it just discounts? I was initially capped and then it was discounted. That was discounted. Okay, that also means a big difference in the fact. I want to make sure that we save room for you guys to ask questions. I'm going to ask one more question, and then we're going to open it up, which is, is that awesome. You did share about, you know, the three cardinal principles that drive you, curiosity, passion, and drive. Right. I understand that there's another one that you care deeply about, which is oftentimes not talked about, which is generosity. I wanted to give you the floor and talk about that principle. How does that, how does that, how is that a compass for your actions? And why should other entrepreneurs care about generosity when they're just worried about their survival? No. No, it's a good question. I think, honestly, when you are initially worried about survival on that too, like, you have to think about generosity in a different way than, you know, you think about generosity, like, you know, when, when you're at a different state of business. But I think the generosity part, as it just a holistic philosophy goes a long way, going back to the mission in the purpose around what you're trying to do. The point is, is that there is a bigger picture movement of what you want to build and what the impact of this is. Like, yes, in theory, the fundamental purpose of any corporation is to, you know, make money. And that is true. And that has to be the case because, you know, without money, then you can't invest and without investing, you can't build what you want to build, and if you can't build that, then you can't make the impact. But the point is, is that is the byproduct, not the end result, from what you want to do. And from a first principle's perspective, that's very, very important to be able to establish. And I think getting people along for that, like, for example, even early on, getting people along for that journey, making sure that, you know, people have equity as part of the company in that journey as part of the whole generosity concept all the way to, you know, I think when you do have an opportunity to have liquidity and when you do have an opportunity to be able to help others along the way, even outside of, you know, the company or operation or way. Or operation or whatever you may do in life. I think that can be particularly meaningful. And in this case, you know, just not too long ago had done a donation. In this case of $70 million to the Central Florida Foundation, which is part of what is the local community that we have out in Orlando, Florida, where our headquarters is. But we're able to help both local and global causes all around in terms of being able to make a difference and make an impact. And it's awesome just seeing, you know, even everything from, you know, helping the housing crisis locally all the way to global scale. You know, we have now, like, ocean trash cleanup robots that are being deployed, you know, with other partner programs that are around to be able to, you know, prevent and remove the majority of trash out of the ocean by 2050. You know, so there's a lot of, like, really interesting things that can be done that you can also apply creative skills to. Earlier on, I think the reality is that unfortunately, the vast majority of not just the sort of entrepreneurs, but just people generally probably don't really think in a around the generosity aspect until they're probably in the last, you know, couple of decades of life, maybe sometimes even literally until the exact end, you know. I think that in part takes away from some of the importance of being able to apply yourself towards these causes and towards what makes a difference in the world more generally. And I think that whole aspect of, you know, in my case, like philanthropy is going to be a super important part, not just now from the future. And that again, it applies not just, it's not just about, you know, the capital side of it and money side of it about giving, but it's also, again, going back to the holistic mission around what you're trying to do. And the causes you believe in and, for example, you know, the 100 million lives saved you can do, I think if we, if we accomplish that, you know, that that'll be certainly the proudest achievement that what it could do. So it's great. I think there's a question here. Hey, Austin, so I'm currently an undergrad and I'm an engineer looking to work at the intersection of software and hardware. And one of the questions I have for you is kind of like how does approach, you know, like go to market as like an early entrepreneur. So I imagine that as a hardware company, you know, as like a startup, try to sell to some of these auto manufacturers actually going to be quite difficult. And you're going to run into a lot of pushback from these legacy companies. So curious to see how you're approaching how you kind of like integrated your way through go to market. Thanks. Yeah, I mean, I think in terms of the go to market side, you have to take it in like in this case, you know, you have to take it in different phases, you know, first is it's just make sure you can get the buy in of the right people at the right organizations that this can make a meaningful difference as well about reaching the right people. 99.99% of people at automakers would have absolutely no freaking clue what they're looking at when they're looking at a point cloud off of some, you know, light hour prototype, you know, but if you reach the right person like as was the case, for example, back in like 2015, 2016 with Volvo, which is one of our our lead partners and customers, you know, who actually had a light hour expert, you know, that was on board the team. You went up to Portola Valley took a look at, you know, the point cloud in the car and he literally fell out of his chair, you know, the second that he saw that when when you have the context is like, wow, this really can make a huge difference. And then you get those championed responders that have that vision for you with companies that you'd like to work with and partner with. And that's really, really important along the way. Otherwise, you will just get lost in the noise, you know, you won't be able to grow. So I think that's the most important part, at least in the B2B context that you know, B2C is a little bit different, but that that's sort of the world that we did operating it. And for founders that wrestle with whether to go after smaller enterprises where they can iterate more quickly and get some type of deal quickly versus the bigger OEMs that are going to take forever and to kill the company. Do you have any guidance on which you should choose? Yeah, start smaller and then work your way up. I mean, that's honestly the best. I mean, don't get me wrong. Like if someone like at the table say, hey, like I know it was going to sign a billion dollar deal tomorrow and their big company or small company would like, doesn't matter. Just take like focus on the customer obsessed, you know, as the as with Amazon philosophy always is, but you know, but like listen, if you have a choice to stop there too, I mean, naturally, I think it's going to work out that you're going to work with smaller enterprise because they're more nimble. But you guys actually started pretty big with Volvo early on, or did you have smaller companies in advance of Volvo? You know, we did, you know, I think, you know, we had even technology companies that were there earlier on. I mean, I guess they weren't that much like I don't know the louvers of this world or, you know, or whatever. Like there's probably a bunch more that I can talk about. But you know, I think Volvo though, but it's all relative, right? So for example, in the world of automakers, like Volvo is sure they're an automaker, but they're actually smaller. No, no, no, no, they're actually a smaller automaker. So for example, like, you know, in the Mercedes case there too, they're, you know, they actually produce like three times the volume of what Volvo does. Yeah, so, but you know, I think so it's all it's all relative, but you know, they're also like a massive massive company too that so you have to be able to work through it. But you know, it's a risk reward thing. And if you can make it happen, that makes a huge difference. Terrific. Other questions. I think we have. Thanks Austin for the many brilliant ideas. And I work with several of every study companies and what will be your advice when it's really early low cash to build team and bring other people on board? I think that's where the extreme efficiency matters. You have to be super scrappy early on. You're going to have to find a way in one way or another to be able to get people on board with the mission on people on board with the vision. That's where, you know, equity can come in handy. You know, you want to be smart about it. You don't want to be too stingy with, you know, equity early on in terms of what what you can provide at the same time in terms of the opportunity and outcome. But just make sure that the people that you provide it to are going to be there for the long run like day in, day out, you know, doing absolutely whatever it takes to make a business successful. And if you have those people and can do it right, then that's really all you need. Now, I think at the same time, it's amazing what, you know, even cash constrained, you know, what people can really do when you put your mind to it to get to that next step. But the thing is that you have to make sure that the people that are along with you for the journey, make sure you recognize that there's no theoretical world where you can ever get to where you want to go to with the kind of cash constraints and with the constraints you have. You have to see yourself taking it a step at a time, visualize the end state, but then like break it down into the individual steps of like what has to happen for you to go there? Like what's the best case? What's the worst case? Like what's the path to really be able to get there? And I think walking people along for that journey early on also makes a big difference and sort of getting them on board. And people are always going to be the number one expense for those types of companies here. Terrific. Other questions? I think we have. So we've about 150 people on YouTube and Zoom. So the most uploaded question is if you had to do it over again, what aspects of your Lumenar founder journey would you do the same versus do differently? I think the important part about being an entrepreneur is not getting everything right. You know, you will make mistakes all the time and probably beat yourself up for it. The key thing is you just have to make the right decision more than 50% of the time. That's the key. You do that. You'll be in a good spot. But I think at a general level, a lot of things had to work out obviously very well and lock step to get to get to the stage of where we're at. I would just say also like emphasis on the right people. I know people talk about it all the time but cannot be stressed enough. But making sure that you have the right people in the right roles and the right positions. And the way you structure and set up teams is going to look dramatically different every two years as a growing business. And you have to constantly be rethinking how you're structuring the teams, the level of talent that you're able to get in and attract to the business. And at the same time, I think learning more about like I would just say org structures. It sounds kind of boring. But there's resources now where you can look up org structures of like technology companies and how things are set up and ask other entrepreneurs of how they set things up and how they manage the teams and how they actually succeed at scaling. I think it's super important. The reality is that there's always a lot of different steps and a lot of things that you can do differently along the way too. But I think that is one of those things that will substantially reduce the amount of insanity that you have to go through on a year to year basis if you get that right. And there's some parts that I got it right very well. There's some parts that along the journey that I had to learn. That's a great way to say it's learning. It's learning. I think we have time for one or two more. There's a question right here. Yes. Hi. Hello. You're on. You're on. As a hardware focused tech company in the automotive industry, I'm curious if and how supply chain disruptions during the pandemic affected Lumen are and whether you're still feeling those effects given kind of like a long term nature of that technology or the development of that technology. And then additionally, I'm also curious how you view Lumen are in this new currently shaping or currently evolving world as it relates to like geopolitics in the tech industry, especially as it relates to sensors as we've seen recently over the past year. This sort of change on between namely like China and the US. Yeah. So I would say a couple thoughts in general. We're going to supply chain standpoint there too. There's I think if there's anything that people have recognized over the course of the past couple of years is that supply chains are very important, very critical and cannot be taken for granted. This is a completely different shift in mentality for automakers, for big companies, for everyone alike. And I think fortunately we've been largely insulated from a lot of that stuff given for two reasons. One is sort of the obvious that you know we're not a at least yet like a fortune 100 company that you know produces. You know, tens of millions or hundreds of millions of product at this stage. You know that it has to worry about some of the larger scale challenges or issues, but I'd say more specifically given that it's just a lot of development vehicles development work. We're really scaling up in some pretty larger scale number starting you know more later on this year next year, you know the following year when we were scaling series production with our automakers. But the other part is is that made an early bet to be able to be completely vertically integrated from the chip level up. And a lot of the semiconductor shortage challenges that have happened have well I would say just a lot of the supply chain shortages that have happened have been around semiconductors. And that's where being vertically integrated at the semiconductor level where we control that whole side of it everything to the I actually have three different companies that that luminar owns that that part of this it's one is black force engineering the other is called optical gradation the other is called freedom photonics. So basically does a processing chip the Indian gallium arsenide receiver chip and then we have the laser chip for the last one so having control over that supply chain is definitely very very helpful. And that's also made a huge difference in sort of weathering that storm. The other the other part of it is from a geopolitical standpoint. Yeah, I would say that there's a lot of the stuff that people talk about generally. I would just say there's always an infinite amount of talk about politics probably way more than there should be for things that don't end up being substantive issues to the real world at least for these kinds of industries and whatnot. The you know I think the relevant part is that you have to build a global supply chain ecosystem that is available to be able to be able to in a cost effective way provide product to different customers globally like particularly for this industry where like some people get away with just operating something in the US for example like automakers are very globally distributed you know like you have these major centers in you know Germany or Japan or Sweden or China or around around the world or wherever it may be so that's why we actually have a our first major series production factory they're building out of the Mexico that we have that sort of a more neutral location you know when it comes down to that. And then we actually will be building out another factory in Asia to be able to support customers there and beyond globally is something that we just announced a few hours ago today to support the expanded volume from companies like Mercedes and beyond globally so important I have to wrap it up but but but but thank you so much for sharing so generously thank you everybody for tuning in and come into this session of the art deal thought ladies seminar.
