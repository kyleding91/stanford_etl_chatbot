 Who you are defines how you built. This is the OddPattern thoughtlier series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. We are incredibly honored and excited today to have Katrina Lake join us for this session of ETL. Katrina is the CEO of StitchFix and a Stanford alum. Katrina is the daughter of a mother who was a Japanese immigrant who was who taught in public schools in the United States and a father who was an American doctor. She went to Stanford and majored in economics and florida with being pre-med but ultimately went down the business path and went into consulting after Stanford also worked in marketing at Polyvore and then went and got her MBA at Harvard Business School. At the end of her MBA, she launched StitchFix which is a fashion subscription service to help women everywhere discover and explore their style through a truly client focused shopping experience. Six years later, in 2017, she took StitchFix public, becoming the youngest woman at the time to ever take a company public at the age of 34. StitchFix is now a seven and a half billion dollar publicly traded company and Forbes magazine has named Katrina one of America's richest self-made women. We are honored to have Katrina here so everybody please welcome Katrina Lake to ETL. Katrina, welcome. Lots of love for you, virtual love on the YouTube and Stanford community streams. I would love to start off by understanding your path into entrepreneurship because if you look on paper at your background, it doesn't appear that there are several people or models in your life that you could have self-reflected on that would have assured you that the path to entrepreneurship was one that you were destined for and yet you've become sort of the poster child of becoming a self-made woman in the United States. Your mom was a public school teacher, your dad was a doctor. How did you discover the path of entrepreneurship? To be honest, and thank you for having me and hi everybody, it's great to be virtually back of the farm. I reflect on this a lot because I do think that a lot of people sometimes think like, oh, you went to Stanford, that must be where you were inspired to be an entrepreneur. Even at Stanford where I think there is so much exposure to great entrepreneurs and where it is such a clear career path for so many, even there I don't think I realized that this was a path that was available to me. I think some of why I think it's important for stories like my own to be shared is because I do think there are a lot of historical stereotypes around what entrepreneurs look like. I think some of those, and there's many, many people who don't look like Mark Zuckerberg and don't look like Larry and Sergey or whoever who are kind of like the stories of Stanford War and there's a lot of other types of ways to be successful as entrepreneurs. There's a lot of people that look different and different backgrounds. I almost arrived at this path almost through process of elimination. I thought apparel retail is super exciting and interesting and my thesis was like, I just want to be at whatever company is going to be the leader of this space in 20 years. Ultimately, I couldn't quite find any companies that I thought fit that bill. Ultimately, literally by process of elimination, I realized, well, if I don't see a company that's doing it, I can imagine it myself. But the one thing that I would attribute in terms of my background is that, and it's interesting, Robbie, I think you are the one actually who shared with me that I do think being the daughter of an immigrant, I think, is having people in your family who immigrated from a country and took big risks and changed their lives. Having that narrative is just like a really lucky thing, I guess. You shared with me that that's one of the predictors of entrepreneurship, one of the only things that correlates with being an entrepreneur. I think related to that, there are a couple stories in my childhood that I attribute to my belief in possibility and in expansive belief of anything being possible. One of those is, yes, my mom immigrated here from Japan, but was kind of interesting. It's actually her mother, my Japanese grandmother, that desperately wanted to be in the United States. She was born in Japan during the war and grew up during the war. I idolized the United States and always felt like she should dream to being an American someday. She lives in Japan. She didn't learn to drive a car. She was in an arranged marriage. It was crazy that somebody in that context would think someday. I'm going to be an American. Through long way where she had two daughters, she made sure her daughters went to college and encouraged them to go to grad school in the United States. Actually through her daughters was able to make her way to the United States eventually. That's one of them. The other one on my Caucasian side is that my grandfather was raised by two women. He was raised by his mother and her sister because both of them, when my grandfather was only like a year and a half, he lost his father. His mother's sister also was in a similar circumstance where both fathers passed away. Now these two sisters had five kids in between them. This was before welfare and before a lot of the social services that we know today. This was a long time ago. These two sisters got together and they're like, one of us is going to be, she was actually a buyer. She ended up becoming a buyer at a department store in Minnesota. One of them was like, I'm going to go to work. The other one's going to take care of the kids. They had this household that was led by two women. My grandfather, my American grandfather, taught me how to use a computer. He taught me to write a bike. He taught me to drive. He had this belief that girls and women can do anything because of his upbringing. I think these narratives, this probably seems like a random aside, but I think these narratives are really important. I think as we think about how do we instill and now I have two young children and as we think about how do you instill in children and young people this belief that anything is possible. I think, well, I'm incredibly proud of the journey that I've had and I think they've overcome a lot to do this. I feel like I have overcome less than some of these people in my family that I've heard about. You think taking a company is public. Whoa, raising five kids. That was a crazy thing to do. Imagining that you could be an American someday when you were in a range of marriage in Japan, that insane. I think just having those is the benchmarks in your mind of, these are the things that people do and that's normal. It actually creates a really expansive mindset. I think these narratives who tell are super important, I think, to be able to have these, everybody, I'm sure every single one of you listening has narratives in your family of people who've done incredible, amazing, totally beat the odds things. I think those things are really important to celebrate because it really changes your mindset. It really changes what you believe is possible for yourself. I love this because I think these undercurrents of your lineage are actually much more powerful indicators of having that spirit of entrepreneurship and the gifts of being a first or second generation American is that thing that's baked into you. That's actually very hard to actually be taught. That's just embedded in you. It is very much of the Maya Angelou Ilk of I enter in a room as one, but I have a thousand people behind me. I do think that we oftentimes don't discuss these things. Especially when you're going into a new path where there aren't people that stereotypically you can self-reflect that look like you. It's very many people have imposter syndrome. They feel that they weren't deserved, that they're not supposed to be on that path. Many people even at Stanford, forget entrepreneurship, just being a student at Stanford feel like they have imposter syndrome. Did you ever feel like you had imposter syndrome? If so or if not, what advice do you have to those who feel like they have that? Yeah, I will try not to go on a total rant about this, but this imposter syndrome thing drives me nuts because I get asked this a lot and I understand the sentiment of it and I think what I think is most, I just hate the whole concept of it because I feel like when you say imposter syndrome it makes it sound like something's wrong with me. I have the problem and I'm like no, no, no, if I am feeling excluded in your environment or in your community or in your whatever feel in the blank, you're the one with a problem. I don't have a syndrome. You have something to fix and so I think there's actually a great article that was written actually last week in HBR that was the title was stop telling women they have imposter syndrome. It's broader than that. I think anybody can feel imposter syndrome. You don't have to be a woman, but it talks actually, it's a very interesting. When I go on a rant on it, I didn't actually know a lot of the historical context of the word and how it really was specifically targeted towards women for a long time. But I do think as a community we have worked to do where it's like as a business community we have worked to do as even in places in Stanford, there's probably majors in Stanford or classrooms in Stanford where there's groups of people that feel like they don't belong there and they don't feel included and rather than making it seem like that's something that's wrong with them. That should be our communal problem that we have to solve to make sure that people can feel equal access to success and that people can feel included in those contexts. I hope that the narrative changes a little bit on this because it just puts the burden on women or not a represented community of like, oh, you have the problem. I'm like, I don't have the problem. Everybody else has the problem. Yeah, I love that. I think that's great. Well, I think also the proof is in the pudding. You've been designated by Forbes to be one of America's richest self-made women. I think in January of this year, you were designated officially to be a billionaire becoming one of I think 19 female self-made billionaires in the United States. That's against I think over 200 self-made male billionaires in the United States. And I'd love to talk about that if we can a little bit. Before I get into the gender dynamics, a lot of people are enamored with money. Obviously, there is the fame song, I want to be a billionaire so fricking bad. On the cover of Forbes Magazine with Oprah and the Queen, you are now in that ilk of Oprah and Cheryl Sandberg. And I think you're one of the newest, if not the newest sort of American-made billionaires. While it's fresh, can you tell people honestly what does it feel like to be a billionaire? What does it feel like to cross that milestone? Is that something that you felt was significant? You know, I mean, if I'm really honest, it really doesn't feel any different. It doesn't. And to be clear, also, these are paper, these are all just correlated with whatever the stock price does. And so obviously a lot of my wealth is tied up in such thick stock. And so, of course, I hope that it continues to do very well. But these things don't, honestly, I think what's a little hard for me is this has never been a primary source of motivation for me. I don't think being famous is not a motivation for me. Being rich was really not a motivation for me. And so I have my own political and social beliefs that conflict with where I am in my career and where I am in society. And I think that for me, I started Sishfix because I was intellectually super interested in this problem. And I felt like this, I wanted a job that was intellectually stimulating where I felt like I could create change. And I started Sishfix for reasons that were really more of just like this is the job I'd like to have. And I can create this myself. And wealth was really not part of the equation. And I think what's just like a, and I don't know if this is going to be true for many, for everybody. But I would say getting to $10 million or something, that was very powerfully motivating. To be able to feel like I could hit a milestone that meant that me and my family would be comfortable and that we'd be able to whatever. That is a very, very powerful milestone. Then getting to these crazy numbers with all of these zeros, it's not, I don't find that as much of the motivation. So I think it's interesting that like societally, there's a lot of obsession around it. And maybe for others, they find that path really, really motivating. But I believe that we can motivate people in general through actually different means. I think people find purpose really motivating. I think people find impact really motivating. I actually think there's a lot of other things that are more motivating to people than dollars. And I think as a society, I think capitalism is one where you assume that the primary motivation of people is money. And I'm not sure that that's totally correct. It's great to just hear it from, because I think people say that it's great to hear it from somebody who's actually in the experience. The air is not sweeter now that you've got this much money or whatever. It's the same drive. But can we, can you comment though on why you think there's so few female, self-made billion airs relative to males? It's an order of magnitude difference. Do you have any thoughts on that? I mean, I could spend the whole rest of my time on this. But I mean, the world is fraught with bias and discrimination and a lack of fairness and equality. And I would say it's one of the things that when I was at Stanford, and I loved economics, I mean, I did Humbile also, but I loved economics where I felt like, oh, in a perfect world, this and this and this happens. Our world is not perfect. I think it's actually been one of the most depressing and stunning things, I think, as I've gone through this, of just realizing how bias is baked in every single step along the way. And I was probably raising 20 cents on the dollar relative to what other white men out there were able to do. And even now, being a publicly traded company, when I'm sitting across the table from potential investors of public equities, and you kind of think of the great equalizer of the stock market, and it's still brought with bias. There are still portfolio managers that are largely white men on the other side of the table deciding, oh, this company is really valuable, and this one's not. And I think people have a lot harder time building trust across lines of difference. We know this. And so every time I'm sitting across the table from somebody who doesn't look like me, which is most of the time in this world, I am at a disadvantage. And so I don't say that to complain, I don't say that to whatever. But when it is not accidental, that we are that it is much, much harder for certain groups to reach these levels of wealth and to reach these levels of success. This is something that structurally, as a society, has been ingrained for hundreds of years. And we've made some progress. But I think still the reality is that the people that are largely in positions of power are largely the same types of people that were in positions of power 100 years ago. And that systemic bias creates real headwinds for entrepreneurs who might come from a different background, who might look different, who might not be instantly relatable to the people who are making decisions around who gets to raise capital and who doesn't, which companies are the best and which ones aren't. And so can you talk about how you navigated that path? I know there's a lot of steps between starting the company to where you're at, given this environment that exists. But what I guess would I would be curious about is can you talk about even just the fundraising process when you're pitching to VCs for a service that's focused on a demographic different than the typical DC, how do you navigate that fundraise and how do you pitch to potential investors that don't reflect at all your target customer demographic? Can you add color to that experience? Yeah, I mean, that happened all the time. And I think the world has gotten slightly better since I was raising money from VCs 10 years ago. But all the time I would get comments like, oh, well, I don't see why anybody would want a service like this or like, oh, my wife, is it why is this any better than my wife's personal shopper at Sachs? And I'm like, these are just like not even relevant. And you know, and I think there's a time when we got to the final rounds of a lot of venture firms and we got to, then we would like oftentimes get to the final round, meet the whole partnership, do the whole song and dance and then not quite get there. And I mean, I had one VC who was very kind to kind of share more context. And he was like, I get to choose one or two board seats a year. And he's like, I love my job. I'm really lucky I love my job. And I'm like, I want to pick board seats where I live and breathe the company. I wake up every day thinking about it. And I want to add value to his board member. And he was like, and I just, I don't think I can wake up in the morning thinking about women's dresses and I just don't think I can add a lot of value to you in this space. And that was really heartbreaking because, look, I've made similar decisions to you. I'm on the board of Glossier because I love the brand because I love Emily. I purposely did not join the board of a casual gaming company or whatever else that doesn't fit my passions and what I'm excited about. And so if you think about the lack of diversity in that VC world and just like what likely those people will be gravitating towards, like, I said joke, it would be like, I would have had an easier time raising money for an app that helps guys organize their tea ball leaks for their kids. That was a pain point that always men really understood. And that would have been easier for a university to raise money for than a company that I have now that has almost $2 billion in revenue and is in a $400 billion market opportunity. And so I think that it is challenging, I think, when again, coming back to just the lack of diversity that's in those decision makers and who gets money, it dictates a lot of things. It's like which companies get founded, like which people are going to be accumulate generational wealth. And I think that kind of company cultures are going to be created where like, you know, my children are going to work. Like all of these things end up actually being decided by a pretty small group of people and a pretty small group of people that's not very representative of like our broader population and their needs. And so, you know, I think there's no question. We need more there. I mean, in terms of my tips for it, like I do think at the end of the day, like this is, you know, I'm a very quantitative person. Like this is actually like a great business and it has been a great business for a long time. You know, I really relied on my own handle of the numbers and of cohorts and of the financial statements and really being able to show people like, look, even if you don't feel like you can wake up excited about personalizing and women's apparel, like, you know, you can at least wake up and get excited about like the size of the business and the size of the market opportunity and like, you know, the profitability profile of the company. And so, you know, I had to focus on different ways to get people excited. And to be clear, like we in the end, like we found great investors who have been, you know, great, you know, mostly have been great backers of the company and many of whom are still involved in the company today. And I feel very lucky that I was able to find that along the way. But, you know, it definitely is not always an easy path. Yes. And I do love the fact that, you know, going back to, you know, you can, this is making money is a great thing and appealing to like that core and having that core inside of that, that you know the solidity of the business. I want to spend time on just the path on how you actually built the business out. If I can though, there is a sensitive subject which I'd love to, which I'd like to broat. Well, it's been, let me just say this, it's been reported in the press that there was a venture capitalist that funded you that you faced sexual harassment from. And like any entrepreneur you needed that venture capitalist support to raise future rounds with future investors and that, and that venture capitalist, because of that you had to sign an NDA to effectively not discuss the sexual harassment in order to continue the path of the company forward. I know that you are still bound by that NDA. And so I'm not going to be asking about that. I do just want to take though my moderator prerogative and just mention it. What I would like to ask is this, it's been now I think seven years since the start of the Me Too movement. Do you think things have gotten better? Yeah, it's a good one. Yes, thank you. I cannot speak to it. And but you know, I mean it's an interesting question like how things got better. Like on the flip side, like I, or on the pro side, like I was kind of, maybe not that recent because I was actually sitting face to face with somebody which seems now like years ago. But I was meeting with an entrepreneur who was like, you know, she was like, I read all the stuff that you had to deal with and she was like, I, like I can't believe that that happened. And like it's so mind blowing that you had to like thank you for paving the way and it's crazy. You had to go through that. And like honestly, like part of me was like, that's cool that like you think that was crazy. And you know, when Me Too stuff came out, like, you know, I had many friends that had crazy oh, but this crazy thing happened to me and this crazy thing happened to me. And so, you know, I think that like, you know, within the course of, you know, I guess this woman is probably 10 years younger than me, you know, and in the course of 10 years that to her, it would be unfathomable that people that women would have to face this type of stuff at work. Like that's kind of cool. I'm like, you know, from my generation, like people dealt with that kind of stuff and it was kind of like the price of doing business and that now it's unfathomable. Like that's great. But also like, it's just like the bare minimum, right? It's almost like saying like, oh, this, you know, underrepresented group is like no longer being physically assaulted in the streets. And so now things are better. And it's like, you know, there's still tons of bias and discrimination. And so, you know, I think the fact that like those types of crazy things happen less and like that that's a great thing. Obviously, and we should be happy for that. But I do think like ultimately the reason that a lot of those types of things were allowed to happen for decades and decades is because of the vast inequity and bias in our system, right? Like if everybody looks like a certain type of person, like it makes it very easy for these types of behaviors to become normalized. And you know, and if obviously like if at all these venture funds, if like half the team were women, like this type of stuff probably never would have happened. And so, you know, I think it's like at the end, like it is, you know, it's great that I think we've made some progress. Like I do think that like there was an acknowledgement of a lot of bad behavior that was happening that is probably no longer happening. But I view that as table stakes, like the progress that I want to see is I want to see better representation at the top. Like I want to see better representation on cap tables. I want to see better representation in the GPs of venture funds. Like, you know, we need to see more equal representation at the top in order to really see the progress that we need to see. Awesome. Thank you. I am going to be students. I'm going to be going to your questions in about 10 minutes. There's so much wealth that I want to, and we're going to have such limited time. But I want to shift now towards just talking about leadership because you are one of the most well respected leaders and people self reflect on how confident you are and how you lead and create and make people better. I'd like to spend a little bit more time on that. When you describe Katrina, how would you describe your leadership style? You know, it's probably evolved a little bit over time. But I would say the thing that really has stayed the same is like I do see like, I don't know, authenticity and vulnerability is like a real cornerstone of it. And you know, I feel, I don't want to say lucky in this. But like I think one of the like side effects of like I, you know, I started a company when I like, I had literally managed you nobody before. Like, I had, you know, I'd worked hourly jobs. Like I had two like junior jobs after, you know, after college. But like I had managed one in turn. And that was the only person who I'm still in touch with Dan. He's wonderful. But like I'd managed exactly one person before I started such fix and now we have like 9,000 employees, right? And so a lot of, you know, what I've learned, I've learned on the job. And so, you know, I think one of the good things about like knowing that you know nothing is that like, you know, the only thing that I had and like I didn't have some amazing resume. I didn't have, you know, I wasn't the best coder in the room or whatever. Like I didn't have some accolade that like that was like you should be the CEO. All I had really was like an ability to bring people along. And like, you know, being authentic with people about what's happening about how I'm feeling about, you know, being vulnerable about like what I feel like I'm good at what I'm not like what are my areas of development? You know, all of these things are ways that I can build trust. And like the ultimate goal is like, you know, you might trust somebody because you think that they're the world's best coder or you trust somebody because you know who they are and you know their values and you feel like you connect with them as a human. And that's a even deeper level of trust. And so, you know, I think that like in retrospect, I'm so glad that that's where I always invested my time because I think ultimately trust that you're building through the humanness of connection and, you know, and being able to share some of yourself and understand that and others like that's a much more powerful foundation of trust. I think that a lot of these other ones, but it really I think it's, you know, I think it was just organically the way that I figured out that I could lead that I think now is, you know, one of the, I don't know, is now a superpower in leaders, honestly, is like being able to be authentic and being able to be vulnerable and being able for people, you know, at all levels of the organization to feel connected to you. Well, I think a lot of people wrestle with that because how do you, what does that tactically mean? Like how do you actually lead with vulnerability? Because I think I think it's still ingrained in people that if you're putting yourself in, does that mean that you have to, I assume it does, that as a leader, you have to be putting yourself in situations of vulnerability. And if you do, I think a lot of people feel that that will create instability in the organization. If the leader, it doesn't, if the leader is questioning themselves. Can you speak to that? Do you put yourself in situations of vulnerability? Can you give examples if you do? Yeah, I mean, all the time. And, you know, I think, and, you know, to be clear also, like, but even, I think, even in the big decisions, like I was just going to say, like, you want to be firm on the big decisions of the company, but even those, like, like, I mean, I can stand up in front of the company and be like, this is what we decided to do. This is why we decided to do it. Like, you know, if I'm really honest, like, we had a lot of conversations because like, it's risky in these ways and our little worry, this part might not work out. And like, you know, I get that these are the reasons not to, but like, at the end of the day, this is why I decided it. And like, you know, and that's a vulnerable way to be able to like, stand by a decision, but also recognize that like, hey, like, it's not obvious. Like, I think a lot of times people think that like, you know, it's really, really clear. Like, you just wave the pros and cons. And it's obvious. You run the DCF model and you should definitely do it this. And like, that's not the way decisions are made, honestly. And so, you know, I think like that, I don't know, like, I think just like sharing more of that, like, behind the scenes. Like, in general, and I'll tell a funny story that actually relates to Stanford. Like, you know, I think the more like you can get comfortable with like those awkward, vulnerable, like, you know, you know, some situation, you know, you're going to be able to laugh out later, like, kind of situations. And like, example from Stanford is that when I went to Stanford, Squash was like a club sport. And one of, I lived in Ujama and my friend who lived in Eucalypto, I think in Lagunaida, my friend who lived in Eucalypto, she was the first person to get recruited from the East Coast to join the Squash team. And so, you know, I knew nothing about this sport, like I grew up in San Francisco mostly. And like, you know, nothing about this sport. And, but I knew my friend had been recruited for it. Anyway, long story short, I'll try to tell it in a short version. That long story short, like, you know, it was like a Wednesday night and she called me, Wednesday afternoon and she called me and was like, Ken, this is so random. She was like, but like, you know, our number eight player is super sick and like can't get on a plane. Our number 11 players in a four hour lab and we can't get a hold of her. Our number 12 player went home to see her parents in Sacramento, like our number 13 player. Right, like blah, blah, blah. She was like, this probably won't happen. But like if we are super, super desperate, we're supposed to be taking a red eye to, you know, to New Haven, to New or whatever, maybe to New York, I forget how we got there. But she's like, we're taking a red eye to Connecticut or whatever tonight. And worst case scenario, we need, like she's like, we need a warm body or else we can't play. She's like, we need 10 warm bodies on the court or we can't play. She's like, worst case scenario, would you be willing to come? I was like, I'm not even going to tennis. Like I don't even know what sport this is. Like she's like, but do you have plans this weekend and would you be able to come? Like sure. And so like, you know, I assume they were going to find somebody else, but like hours pass as she calls me, she's like, so we couldn't find anybody else. And like, can you come? And so I show up and I get on the plane and I was like, and you know, she'd been like, oh, we'll teach you on the plane. Like we took like a red eye. Like there was no teaching me on the plane. And so we get to, you know, we get to, it was it, it was a Yale. And this was the national tournament, the national squash tournament. It's like, you know, like all the best teams. And I had never set foot on a squash court in my life. And so like, you know, I get there. I mean, it was so, it was so embarrassing. Like I thank God this is before like UGC, like, and that there probably, hopefully, is no video footage of this out there. But like, it was so humiliating. Like if anybody knows the squash is, it's like a ball. It has to be warmed up. People like, thank, thank, thank you. And they're like, you know, and they're people. It's a really athletic sport. People are really fast all over the court. And like, you know, and I had to play all weekend. I had to play in like seven different things. Like our first one was against Cornell, who was like, you know, a top 10 team. And this girl who'd been playing squash for her whole life has to bite me. And like, it was so, and she like was warming up the ball. And she like, lobbed it over to me. And it's like, I'm whiffing. And like, I mean, it was so humiliating. And I had to stand up there every single, you know, you'd play multiple people. I mean, it was just crazy. And so I played every single round and literally never returned a serve the entire time. And so these matches were really short, which is good for the embarrassment factor. And then of course, one of the matches I saw a girl that I knew from high school, like in this dance. And like, to this day, I'm like, this must be how she remembers me. Because like, I have not seen her since. And I didn't have a chance to explain myself to be like, actually, I've never played squash. All I know is that she's spectated and saw me like, be horrible at squash. And that like, wherever she is in the world now, that's probably her memory of me is that I was like a horrible squash player. Anyway, I tell that whole long story because my point is, is like, now I can laugh about it. And it's like, you know, and I mean, I even laughed about it then. Let's be honest. But I think like the more you can put yourself in these situations where like, it's embarrassing, it's awkward, it's whatever. But you just like, it's just like anything. Like you get better at it, you get used to it. Like, go to a hip-hop dance class, like, go, you know, sing karaoke or do whatever the thing that seems like it's mildly embarrassing. And like, just keep on doing mildly embarrassing things. And then they eventually won't be that embarrassing anymore. And those are things like that, you know, create commonality. And the more people feel like, you know, oh, well, other people have embarrassing experiences too. Like it humanizes you. Sorry. I'm not talking about it. I'm talking about it. It's an important lesson. It's such an important lesson. I think it's actually the heart of this notion of entrepreneurship and resilience. I just don't want people to lose the lesson, which is you, just to be clear, you're not the type of person who goes into this just saying, you know, I don't care. And so, you know, I can do these things because I don't care. And I don't want to be putting words into your mouth. But do you think of yourself as a confident person or do you think of yourself as a sensitive person when it comes to doing these things when you're putting yourselves in these situations? Are you deliberately putting yourself into these situations of vulnerability even today? And is it more than just telling people about your concerns, like on what you think the risks or the contingencies are? Is it actually putting yourself physically into situations of vulnerability perpetually? Yeah. I mean, I'm with COVID and stuff. I've done it, honestly. But like, I mean, I love going to like a ballet class or a hip hop dance class. I can tell you I'm not very good at either of those things. And like, you know, I think it's a humbling experience. And so, like, the short answer to your question is like, I am a confident person. Like I really am. And I'm not sure that I would have said that, honestly, when I was a student at Stanford, and like, I don't know that I would have said that. And I do think like, like a lot of things, like it's learned. It's a skill that you can actually develop over time. And like, I think the more that you can do scary things or things that like might hurt your ego and then you come out of it and you're like, that's the way it is. And I think that's in her way. That actually wasn't that bad. And like, the more you do that, like, I think the more you realize how resilient you are. And I think so much of the confidence question is just like, it's a fear. It's a fear of the unknown a little bit, right? When did you know that you were, so that's really fascinating. At Stanford, if I asked Stanford Katrina, I said, are you confident in your soul of souls, you would have said, no, I'm not confident. I, it's a really, I wish I could go back in time. Probably, yeah, I don't know. I certainly don't know that I would have said yes. Or when the life-based time was when you said, I am confident. I don't know. It's a good question. I mean, weirdly, like, even like the, you would think that being said, no, to like 50, like, you would think that like 50 venture investors telling me no would make me less confident. I actually would argue that like that, I mean, and maybe that's like the squash thing, right? Like, it actually ultimately, I think maybe more confident. Like, I kind of felt like more conviction that like, you know, you may not see it, but like, I really believe in this. And so like, I think if any, like, you know, I think a lot of those, you know, like rejection in general, like, you know, getting rejected from jobs, getting rejected from schools, like, ironically, I think like those things actually, like in the right like, can actually make you more confident rather than less. And so I do think like, you know, Amazon as a company, for example, like they do a lot of like, celebrating failure or whatever. And like, I, you know, I think we could be definitely better about that as such fix. But I think there's a lot to that because I do think that like, you know, a lot of like the hard times and whatever, like those are what make us stronger. And like, you know, I think you can, I mean, if, you know, if any of you, hopefully many of you have not, but if any of you have had like a traumatic thing happen in your family or like a illness in your family, like, you know, it's, it's a really hard thing. But oftentimes, like the family comes out stronger and you've said things to your family that you wouldn't have normally said and you feel more connected to your family. And like, you know, I think that those like, you know, going through hard things makes you stronger. And like the squash story or the going to a hip hop dance, like those are all just microversions of that that I think are exercising the same muscle. Yes. So it sounds like if you have a fewer failure, which is what actually prevents many people from pursuing the path that they're supposed to do in this life, the guidance is just get comfortable with failure. Just throw yourself. Like, I've seen, I forget what it was in, but like, I read to be clear, I haven't done this. I read something about how somebody was like trying to get rejected every day. And so like every single day, they would like go to a stranger on the street and be like, can I borrow five dollars or like, you know, just try to try to get rejected every day because then you get like, you build a muscle for it. And to be clear, I have no recollection of where this anecdote was from. But I remember thinking to myself like, you know, like, I didn't do that. But like, that's kind of a cool way to do it too. It's just like the more you can exercise that muscle in many ways, I think the more, you know, the stronger you got. I think it's a great, great lesson. So thank you. I'm going to turn it over to the student questions now in our final 10 minutes. The most uploaded question is from YouTube chat and it's asking, how does StitchFix fit into the future of fashion, which we are now aware has to have sustainability and circular products at its core, product life, fair wages, carbon issues, and sustainable fabrics. Totally. I mean, this is definitely a topic that's near and dear to my heart and something we spent a lot of time thinking about. I mean, there's some interesting, like, StitchFix in general, like, I think the history of a peril has been like cheap and like, I don't know, cheap and whatever, like mostly cheap. But right, like where it's like, oh, let's buy some, let's buy things that are super cheap and trendy, super cheap and disposable. And there's no question that that has to go away for like a number of reasons. And so, you know, I think first and foremost, like, you know, we are focused on like, we don't want you to buy 100 jeans from us that are 70% off. Like, we want you to buy like one or two pairs of jeans for us that are like really great jeans for you. And so, in a world in which people are buying fewer things, which like I do believe that is the future, like a model like StitchFix where we are getting to know you, we are sending you what you want. Like, that is a much more sustainable version of that. And I would also, I mean, aside note, we could talk about sustainability for the next hour. And so, I know it is like when you look at retailers like dollar for dollar, just so everybody knows this when they're making their purchase decision, e-commerce is actually wildly more sustainable from a carbon footprint perspective than store retail. And part of that is like, if you, you know, many of you probably come from places that are hotter, pulled, like the sustainability element of heating and cooling a huge department store, like you think of how tall those ceilings are, you think of how huge transactions happen in there, like just like the huge store footprint that we've built is like, not it's one of the worst things that we've done for our environment, certainly from a retailing perspective. And so, even in StitchFix, when you compare, like, you know, people are trying things on, sending it back, like you would think that has a bigger carbon footprint. It actually doesn't. We are a fractional amount of what department stores do. So, of course, that's still not enough. There's still a lot more that we can do. We've made commitments and you can go and look at, we have a social impact page. We made commitments around having, having all of our exclusive brands have more sustainable fabrics, the circular economy, I think is wildly interesting. Like, I think, you know, I would love to, like, there are lots of things in my closet that would happily have a second life. And, you know, we already have great data, like what StitchFix is differentiated at is that we have great data. We can really predict the right things for the right people. That's better in a first-person world, just to be clear also, because we are not in the business of overproducing and over making things. And then, you know, we are only buying the products that we know will have happy homes. But in a second-hand world, it's even more interesting, I think, because, like, even in the first-hand world, it's hard enough to find jeans that fit. But, you know, you're trying to navigate years and years of different designers, apparel, like all of a sudden, you really need recommendations. Like, I think anybody who's tried to buy in the second-hand market knows, like, you know, if you know exactly what you want, like, it might be easier, but like, you could spend hours and hours and hours and hours trying to meet through that. And so, anyway, a long-winded way of saying, like, you know, I think there's a lot of innovation coming here. Excited about the direction that things are going. And, you know, I really hope this is fixing to be at the forefront of it. Awesome. That's great. The next question is, what specific segment of the massive clothing fashion sector are you targeting? Affordable-fast fashion, boutique brands, vertically integrated clothing production, dress code specific, religious, lower middle upper class, and why? Yeah. I mean, so apparel is a $400 billion market in the US and the UK alone. And that's kind of where we play right now. You know, I think what's interesting strategically is that historically fixes have been really, like, you know, the first eight or nine years of our business were really focused around fixes, which is you sign up, you let us know what types of things you like. We have a stylist that's using algorithms to deliver to you things to try on at home. And that, and so that model is really a little bit more of, like, a lean back and shop for me model. And, you know, that had an element like you could either get that delivered when you like or you could get a deliver on a cadence, if you like. But so that, you know, that was kind of the first version. And then really this next model is actually like, you know, potentially more, so, you know, more than 50% of people in the United States say that they hate shopping. And so this lean back and shop for me works great for them. But there's also a lot of people that want to have more say and want to be, you know, kind of more, you know, I guess more proactive in their decisions around fashion. And so, you know, one of the things that we've been doing is we have this, we have shop, which is a way that people can actually explore their recommendations. And there's a lot of innovation to come that really allows us to be able to have people who, even people who want to have the, you know, more in the front, you know, in more in the driver's seat that they would actually be able to also experience great recommendations. And so, you know, so those have been kind of just like psychographically. But, you know, we are very, like, we're our audience is super democratic. Like, we have really broad age range even on income, like we're pretty broad income range. And, you know, because we are in the business of personalization, you know, we can actually address many, you know, many of those segments. There's a question from Stanford student, which is what is something you would have done different at Stanford that could have helped you in your entrepreneurship path. And if I could, Tina C. Legg, our director has a favorite question, which I'd love to ask too, which is, what do you wish you knew? What do you wish you would have known when you were 20? It's different. I got a little bit wrong. But what advice would you give in yourself at, or would you give our other 20-year-olds? I mean, what would have done differently at Stanford? I mean, ironically, like, I, you know, like, I, and these were all the right things to do. But like, you know, I had a part 10 job, the whole time I was at Stanford, I, like, I really was focused on like the bear, I don't want to say the bear minimum, but it was like I had an econ major and a hung violiner. I graduated a quarter early. Like, you know, I was, I probably was like, I mean, of course, you know, all these things are 2020 when you can look back. But, you know, like, part of me wishes, like, I wish I hadn't, like, forced my, you know, like, I don't know, I just wish I would have relaxed a little bit, maybe, and like, taking, taking classes that weren't necessarily ones that were can directly connected to the image. Like, I wish I had taken more weird classes. Like, I feel like they're a bunch of like, the, like, oh, sleep in dreams, like that class. Like, everybody talked about sleep in dreams. And like, you know, they're a bunch of like these legendary classes, like learning to golf, like, that sounds so silly, but like, or play tennis or like, I don't know, do something cool, like, play squash, like, I don't know, I wish I had learned, like, some other skill, like, with all the great resources that Samford had. And so, I mean, interestingly, like none of my regrets, honestly, are like, like, even like, learning to code or whatever, it's actually not really one of my regrets. Like, I actually, my regrets are more like, I wish I had spent more time doing things that were like, were less academic, I think, than like the things that I did. And, um, and just, you know, spent more time on the more like global notion of learning, besides like the more targeted version of learning that I was doing to kind of achieve what I thought were my goals at the time. Um, and then advice that I would give to myself, I mean, honestly, the advice I would have given to myself for this whole journey is more of just like how, like, like, I just don't even think I had the capacity to think on as big of a scale that like, you know, I sadly, like, I was not, and I was not like walking around the pitch deck about how like, this was going to be a billion dollar business in less than 10 years, and we were going to go public in less than 10 years. Like, I didn't even imagine that, like, that wasn't even at the upper end of what I thought was possible for the business. And so, I do think that like, just, you know, like, how, I don't know, like, I, I guess I would have like tried to help myself to like think bigger and like, you know, and like, believe in more possibility. I think that I even, even get at the time. And, um, and then the general advice that I give that I think I was fairly lucky to be able to mostly have this is like, you know, I do think like in careers, like, people really obsess over, like, you know, does this job define me and like, is this, you know, is like, is this job really me? And like, I think they're just like, I don't know, I think there should be like a healthy delineation between like something can be your job and it doesn't need to be your identity. And I think, you know, my generation struggles with this a lot of just like, you know, I think feeling really inextricably tied to like the world that you're in in that moment. And like, that creates, you know, pros and cons. Or I think like, if you, if you get laid off by a company or you leave a company, like, all of a sudden, you feel like some of your identity is gone. And that's not a great thing. And, and on the flip side, like, if you feel like you're the company is not aligned with your identity, it becomes, you know, a very tumultuous, hard thing. And I get that. But I think, I don't know, like, I would love, I think like being able to have more of that, like, healthy separation. And like, and I talk about like, you know, I think that the, like, if you have two things in your job, like, if you are feeling challenged, you're learning, you're on the steep part of learning curve, if you have that, and you have a manager who is in support of your development and helping you grow and investing in you, like, if you have those two things, like, like, that's the promised land. Like, that's like the way, you know, I think there was a lot of, like, I don't know, like, I feel like I had a very linear notion of like, this is how you get to point eight of point B. And to be clear, honestly, like, I kind of follow that, like, you know, this is advice that I didn't necessarily follow myself, but I was a little bit like, I need to do this. I need to go to business school, I need to start a company. And like, I did have a pretty linear path. But like, what I've learned now is that I'm actually in the minority, like, most people's paths are not linear. Like, most people are just following really interesting opportunities, are really interesting people and following growth opportunities. And then they end up someplace interesting. And so, you know, I think that like, anyway, this is my 20-year-old self would have been bored by now, so I'll stop. No, this is all cool. And there's a question that's dovetailing what you're saying, which might be our last question, which is, you know, on this, that second piece that you were talking about for your development, which is a manager or a mentor, how did you have a mentor? Because you were going down these paths where there weren't that many, I think, self-reflected mentors that would normally be there. And so, how did you find your mentors, if you in fact, did have a mentor? Yeah. I mean, I've had different mentors along the way. And like, Paulie, where you mentioned I was at Paulie, for a summer and the woman's to kinder. I mean, she was like, I was like a niamid author because she was like the first time that I had met a leader that was very decidedly not trying to fit into the mold of the stereotypical leader you would have. And she was very feminine in her leadership. And there's just so much that I was like, wow, this is really eye-opening that you can lead in different ways. And she was somebody that I kept in touch with periodically. And even now, being a publicly-traded company, there are people out there that have texted me and have, I don't know, just like, reached out of like literally the ether, being like, hey, I'm happy to chat whenever. And I try to do the same thing when I see others. And so, I think, interestingly, like, the mentors have definitely changed over the years. But I felt really, really fortunate to have lots of people, you know, men and women, I think, who are in roles where they have contributed to my success. But just, I've been doing some of my own investing. And so, I've invested in probably a little more than a dozen companies. I only invest in diverse founding teams. Like, I deeply believe that if you are not, if you are not looking thinking about diversity from the moment you're founding the company, it's uphill battle. And a lot of the wealth that's created is created at that founding team level. And so, that's something that's super important to me. And what's been interesting is actually, now that I'm more on the fun side. So now, I can be giving money to fund managers. Like, I'm only, I'm investing in diverse fund managers. And so, I'm even as you're thinking about public markets, or even as we're thinking about kind of, you know, venture funds or whatever. Like, you know, I'm putting my money where my mouth is and I'm putting, and I'm backing people that I know share the same values as mine.
