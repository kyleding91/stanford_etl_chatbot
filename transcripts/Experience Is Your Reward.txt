 You were listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. So it's my sincere pleasure to welcome you to the spring quarter for the series. This is our first of eight coming up here in April and May, but we could not start with a better speaker. His name is Sean George. He's the president and co-founder and COO of Invitay. Yeah, how many of you have ever heard of Invitay before you looked at ETL? Just a few? Well, what's really cool is you will know it by the end of this hour. They went public in February. Yes, they went public and they're in the field of personalized medicine, which is just an absolute fascinating field. He's been there since the very beginning. I mean, let him tell his story, but what I really like about it, because I'm a UC Berkeley graduate. This is where you do your hissing. It's always amazing. It's like a tire letting out. Let me try again. As a UC Berkeley graduate, thank you. It is particularly interesting to me to welcome another UC grad. But no, he's not from Berkeley. He's really interesting. He went to undergraduate at the LA campus. He got a master's degree at the Santa Barbara campus. He got his PhD at the Santa Cruz campus of UC. So I hope he comes and gets a postdoc at Stanford. But let's welcome Sean George. Well, thanks again. Thanks for having me. This is really an honor. In my career, there are oftentimes discussions, people from around the world, people I've worked with, kind of scratching their head, wondering how to, and formal ambassadors and economic development agencies asking, how do we recreate Silicon Valley? And well, certainly not in its entirety, but certainly a major part of that is Stanford. I think it's going to be hard to replicate. So I think they'll keep asking that question. It's an honor to be here. I love telling this story to students, people like you. I certainly hope to inspire you. I hope not to scare you. But I think I'll just tell the story from my perspective. And I think one of the key things often tell people is, is whatever you read about company formation and the mythology of companies starting and whatever you hear about or read about and certainly read about in books, the real story is a lot more nuanced and is also very much dependent on your perspective. So I'll tell you from my perspective what the last five years have been about and I certainly am very interested in any questions you might have when we're done. I'll suggest perhaps some pointers. My learning where I stand today with everything that's happened. And maybe to sum them up first is, if you're going to start a company, if you're going to start a new endeavor, I would offer that it's good to, generally people say it's really good to try something big and disruptive. I think probably on paper and for a lot of reasons that makes a ton of sense. And you can go a lot of different directions. But I think one reason to go do something big and disruptive is because it's incredibly difficult to do and the odds of success are so low that if you're going to go do it, you might as well spend all that time and energy and sacrifice doing something that you think is really important. And in hand with that I think is, it's got to be something that you really, really care about internally. And I think it's hard to even express maybe my thoughts on this. It's not that you care about it. It's that you can't stop thinking about it. It's that when you wake up in the morning, you see something that is a missed opportunity or something somebody else is missing. Or you have an attachment or a passion about something that is so great that if it makes sense to start an endeavor, start up a company to try to address it, you care so much about it that you just can't get out of your head and you're not going to be satisfied until you've made a go at it. Because again, that's going to be important too. Maybe another key learning, you'll have ups, you'll have downs, you may win, you may lose. If you want my input, the experience itself is worth it. That alone, it truly is one of those things where the journey is what matters, not necessarily the outcome. But you will, you know, it will, you will have your highs and your lows. And this is where I think that you've got to maybe balance and level and understand on a variety of levels. Luck has a lot to play with it. Market externalities, externalities on the competitive landscape. There is a lot that has to do with whether or not you in this new venture would succeed. And for two reasons I think it's important. One is a public service announcement. There's plenty of people that start companies and have great success and then proclaim to the world what a genius they are and how they knew it all along. And I similarly reject that mythology that there's one creative force and one person that makes it happen. It takes a team. It takes a team. It takes a group of individuals to do anything worthwhile. I also recommend that to people to make sure to understand, you know, again the downside is a very real possibility. And you know, I think you should still, if you're going to try this kind of thing, you should steal yourself for that outcome and not personalize it. Do your best if you've got to passionate about something, do your best to build something that makes a difference. But a lot can happen. And if you end up failing in the process, you know, that's how this works. Pick yourself up, you know, dust yourself off, go find another team to tackle another problem and go do it. And then I think, you know, speaking of team, you know, that's maybe the other key lesson that I've learned is, you know, the team you start with, the team that joins you, the team that invests in you, it is, you know, my perspective, my two cents on it are, it is very much about the team that you choose to go through this with. And should you, at any point along the way, start experiencing success and building and growing, I think in retrospect, I would say, you know, all of the energy, and we've, we'll get a little bit into it. We've put a lot of energy into our team and how the place works. And even to the point where in the early days, I thought it might have been a little overkill. And since there was a very high likelihood of success, we wouldn't be around anymore when the money ran out. But now looking back, I actually think every ounce of energy we poured into the way we wanted to work, the way we wanted our team to work, now is, is, is, now it's coming back, it's coming back and I'm not only glad we put as much energy as we did, I actually wish we did more. You can't put enough energy into your team in the way, the way the place works. So those are the major learnings. I'll start from the beginning. You know, the, I was at a company, I was a CEO at a company called Navigenix. It was one of the kind of middle, mid, mid thousands, direct to consumer genetics plays. You know, a lot of good ideas floating around then. We were basically the physician-oriented, stodger, less fun version of 23 and me. And that's, that's, that was our plan. We were going to go take genetics to the masses, really kind of employee health plans, doctors, whatever. It didn't work for a lot of reasons it didn't work. Business model timing, you know, you know, not, don't need to go into it now. But it didn't work. But what, what I did get at the time, you know, from my experience in the industries and the tools, diagnostics, you know, technology industry leading to that, you know, knowing where, you know, kind of the, the micro-raise in use at the time, the DNA micro-raise, kind of where the, the beginning, the harbinger of what was to come in genetic technologies. At the time, a bunch of sequencing companies had been developed, developing next generation sequencing technologies that promised the lower the cost of access to the human genome. And while the business that we were trying to build, what, you know, just, it just wasn't working, what I did see bouncing around from medical geneticists offices to genetics clinics, to doctors offices, talking with genetic counselors, what I did see was the beginning of what we, what we started. And what I saw was, you know, in fact, there are a lot of genetic disorders. There are a lot of genetic diseases, and there are a lot of people impacted by them. And what struck me most is none of the clients that I was talking to were happy about the way it worked. Genetic counselors, medical geneticists, you know, cardiogenesis, cancer geneticists, you know, even, you know, clinicians that were vaguely aware of how genetic testing worked. Nobody was happy, you know, things were very expensive, very, very long lead times, you know, if you ordered a test, it could take up to half a year to get an answer. You know, just really kind of almost primitive, given where the technology was at the time and was going. But even more, even more importantly, this is where, you know, kind of, you know, it really came clear to me a couple of family events, not my personal close family, but, you know, kind of, you know, related, related family and friends and their families. You know, couple events in their lives that had big impact on that family, devastating impact on those families. And then in these clinics, what I would see are not the same families, but equivalent. Families sitting there with their kids in these clinics. And after kind of knowing the situation with the genetic counselors, certainly talking with some of these families along the way, understanding, just getting a good feel for the absolute despair that they were going through. Seeing, you know, in these clinics, these kids, I mean, you know, I actually at the time, when we started the company, I just become relatively new parent. And you know, you can, I don't know if any of you are hopefully not, probably not a lot of your parents wait on that one. That's my other piece of advice. Life advice, wait to have kids. But you know, you think, you know, most parents, most new parents kind of think they have it tough, they don't get to sleep, they have troubles. Seeing these parents with these kids that were not developing, that were not growing, that were having serious, serious problems, really put it in perspective for me. These people had problems. I will never have problems, most likely, that these people have. And I think as I kind of went through that experience, that's what then stuck in my head as this is ridiculous. This is ridiculous. They give them where the technology is today. These people wait so long for the testing. They can't even get access to testing. The clinicians don't even tell them about the testing because it costs $20,000 to get it and very likely won't give them an answer anyway. That's when it kind of all started coming together. So I kind of, at that point, put it together. I knew where the next generation sequencing technology was going. Effectively, the cost per base of the human genome was dropping off faster than Moore's law, which I think, you know, I mean, we all know what Moore's law did for, you know, computing, networking, and everything that has followed. And it was pretty clear about five years ago, this is what's going to happen in medicine. This is what's going to happen in genetics. And, you know, I'm going to go, we're going to go figure out how to make this work. So we decided it was myself, a couple other people that were working with me at the time. We kind of popped out, decided to go start a company. The idea was, hey, let's build a company that will consolidate the three to 4,000 some odd genetic disorders, the tests for these 3,000, 4,000 different genetic tests, consolidated into one highly efficient industrialized platform production line to consolidate the entire genetic testing industry, drive the price of the floor, and make it available to everybody. And that's what we started with. And while there was no way at that time, I could really know exactly where it was going. I certainly couldn't know that I would be standing here today, telling you about it. That's essentially what we are doing. So in Vite, now we are, you know, we're basically hell-bent for leather on bringing genetic testing in a mainstream medical care for literally billions of people on the planet. Anybody in the developed healthcare system can benefit from this. I mentioned the 3,000 to 4,000 genetic disorders that I kind of became familiar with many years ago. In fact, it affects possibly up to 10% of any given population. And up to 10% of population has an inherent genetic disorder. It's just that they're so fragmented, 3 to 4,000 of them are spread, that any one of them seems small enough. The biggest one, the biggest market, solid market by far, is the breast cancer testing myriad, does it, etc. But there's a long tail of these genetic disorders. And so that's what we set out to do, and indeed, thankfully, that's what we're still doing. We went out to raise money. This was end of 2009, not the best year to go out and raise venture capital. And in fact, it turns out, we pitched more than 110 places, firms, funds, what have you. It turns out half of them didn't have any money. You know, seeing where those firms went now, half of them just didn't have any money. The crash had happened, things were rearranging, capital was getting reallocated. So it was a long haul. We pitched more than 110, really, for about a year. It was a fairly tough time. Actually, that was kind of the first set, about maybe six to nine months into it, was the first time I really faced the potential for failure, like squarely in the face. The team that we were working with, there were four of us. We were kind of self-funding it. We had some space. We got going. Actually, we started originally in the Traceg obvious tequila tasting room up there in San Francisco. We're there for about a month and a half. One of the co-founders knew the owner. So we hold up there. Then we moved to the QB3 space over in Mission Bay. So we had some space. We got some of the equipment up and running and we were getting going. Confident that we were going to raise money, but then after six to nine months, just no after no after no after no. Part of the team started shaking loose a little bit. They needed to go get a job. There are spaces where like, hey, how long are you going to pursue this crazy dream? That summer right before, we got a couple of these firms interested was definitely the first time, certainly in my career ever, that I really stared failure in the face. I'm a fairly confident individual. No one's ever accused me of a lack thereof. But boy, that experience there, that was trying. That's by the way, that's why I think you should do it. I think you should do it just for that experience. It's been invaluable to me. Just facing that failure in the face, you pulling these three people along, invaluable, invaluable, and really actually, frankly, prepares you for the next phases of company formation. So we pitched 110, 115 nose, got a couple interested. And finally, one of the firms that we had been talking to, we got the A round and got going. I think, you know, at the time, the idea seemed stupid. The pitch was kind of, hey, the technology curve is happening. There's this big unmet need. We're going to build this engine, the sequencing engine that's going to be able to deliver clinical reports better, faster, cheaper than anybody. Consolidity industry, we're going to go for 50% gross margins. It's going to be an execution play. No intellectual property bear to entry. At the time, the FDA was rattling sabres about sequencing in LDTs. At the time, the gene patents were fully in effect, and there was a patent thicket, you know, kind of hovering over every one of these ideas. The idea of building a biotech company with a long term aspiration of getting to 50% gross margins was completely foreign to any investor in the space. And then, of course, you know, when you're raising money, as I hope a lot of you will try to go do, you know, the thing you get asked all the time is, what's your differential advantage? And if the answer is, because we know what we're doing, and we're going to work harder than anybody else, is not a compelling argument to somebody who's got a very, very high cost of capital. So you know, it is understandable. It took a while. But we did eventually get some investors that I think, frankly, I think they were at the end of their fun, and they just took a flyer on their idea. So these guys seem crazy enough. We'll just give it to them and see what happens. So we got going. We started hiring the team, started getting going. And you know, one of the very early things that, I mean, obviously has led to a lot of the success we've had. Constantly seeking out people that had been a bit, been through before, people have done it before. In the fundraising process, I mean, you know, I look, I was CEO of a company, I run large business units, a tech global business units, a technology companies. It still was an incredible help to run the pitch by four or five people that I knew that had raised money before, who had been VCs before, started companies before. You know, a month and a half of that preparation was invaluable. You know, and that's one thing I would say right from the get go, get people who have done this before, run it by and run it by and run it by and drill it with them. Really test your assumptions. Then once we got funded, it was time to start filling out the board and start reaching out to people I knew, people in the space. And I was really interested in getting Randy Scott. Randy Scott had found an insight, took them public, Randy Scott had found a general in the health, took them public, you know, very, very early player, big player in personalized medicine. And I just kept calling him and calling him and calling him and trying to, everybody I knew that knew him, finally got his calendar shortly after we raised the first round, went to talk him about joining the board. And you know, here was a person who after really spending a year and a half talking to just about everybody in the industry, experts on the medical, technology, investor side and stuff like, basically saying it was a horrible idea. You know, I spent, you know, within 30 seconds of tying with Randy, I can see his facial expression, like he's clear, he gets it. And then he starts talking about, oh, and then this and then this and then this. And it was clear that I had found my board member. So we kind of got going there, got Randy in the board, I had another board member come in kind of an experienced hand in the diagnostic space. And I think this is where, you know, not just in the company formation, but early days along the way, having experienced people, people have done it before, people that challenge you on what you're doing, how you're doing it is invaluable. And this is where I can't say enough where I think there's, you know, again, I hear the mythology myth around companies. And again, my perspective is it's quite different. You have an idea of what you want to do. You are the driver. And I was the driving force of getting this to happen, but there is no way that we would have made it happen without these, these individuals banging on the idea, testing idea, testing assumptions, bringing in their network to test the assumptions further, do channel checks, build models, et cetera, invaluable, invaluable. Some of the things we definitely fought on, the price point, for example, was one of them. One of the early kind of founding concepts was we are going to make this as low price as possible. So one day in the future, we'll catch up on the cogs. And again, anybody with any experience in the diagnostic industry will tell you it is really hard to run a low margin business in diagnostics. And we battle on that, and we battle on that. And that was one thing where I said, you know, where I think, you know, I did stick to the founding purpose of the company. And even though there was a lot of early, you know, not fighting, but you know, debate about it, one thing that kind of strikes me, which is another really important thing, is these individuals shared the same passion that I and the team did. These individuals had the same values as I and the team did. You know, ultimately, when it came down to what is our real model, what are the actual moves we're going to make by way of pricing or offering? It is absolutely essential that all of the people involved share the values, share the core mission. So that kind of goes back to, you know, if I can impart one thing on you, really having that core mission, the core, you know, what it is you are trying to accomplish in view. And having everybody on the same page on that makes, you know, makes these things possible. That is the only way we got past those early days, kind of, you know, testing things out, technology risk, market risk, trying to get clients, all the debates about pricing and offering. The fact that these individuals had so much experience and could really push us as well as the fact that they shared the vision really kind of exit us. And what I think kind of the early spaces of the company, the first two years or so, first, you know, two rounds of financing, essential, essential for it. Now the thing is, so while when we started, you know, I think a lot of people thought it wasn't such a great idea. Things started moving pretty quickly. So when you went to the medical conferences and the clinical conferences, instead of every talk being about how next generation sequencing, you know, was 10 years away, 15 years away, you know, kind of the typical technology cycles in our space would seem, about two years into it, it would seem that they were actually moving a lot faster. Exceptions by the clinical community, the prices, actually, you know, many of the investors we talked to just looked at our price model and said, you are crazy. Costs are not going to come down that fast. And indeed, actually, they were coming down faster. So people were just shocked, even I, who had been in the industry a while, and kind of think of myself as perhaps an overly optimistic technology zealot, even I was shocked how fast these things were coming down. And so things really started to move in the industry and really kind of turned our, you know, out of left field crazy moonshot of an idea into something that all of a sudden everybody started thinking, actually, that's not such a bad idea. And then you've got all of the industry in Cummins thinking that way and you've got all of the 120 investors that you talked to two and a half years ago thinking, oh yeah, that's a great idea. Let's do it. So people start surrounding around the space and this was a period of time where, you know, we had to start making some decisions and they were really, really tough decisions. And I think it's, you know, the way I think about it or the way I would tell you from my perspective is, you know, this is kind of the classic, you know, big piece, small pie, small, small piece big pie kind of thing that a lot of, you know, most entrepreneurs face at some point in time in financing. It's also one of control, right? So, you know, you know, I'm running this shop. I hand-built, hand-selected the team. We are making progress. And then at some point, right again, the market starts shifting. Everything moves. We knock off the technology risk. We prove it can be done. Externalities seem to be going on our favor. FDA basically goes away for a while at the change of the administrations. The gene patent thicket that was pretty much assumed to be something that would block our kind of model forever showed signs of cracking. The first case started popping up through the federal court, through the district courts that was challenging patents, you know, subject matter patent ability for gene sequences itself. And in that period of time, a lot of people started getting interested, interested in the space. A lot of people started getting interested in us. It became clear to us it was turning into an execution play. And at that point then, you've got these, you know, industry veterans around the table. You're looking at, in our kind of business model, what matters? When it starts turning into an execution play, essentially turns no foot race. And you start asking, you start coming to the realization that you need a lot more capital than you thought you did. If, you know, again, if you really want to go for what it is we wanted to do. If we really wanted to go after all of the families that are currently not able to get this information for their kids, for themselves, we were going to have to spend a lot more money. And so that started going into decision making mode where there were a couple companies that we had been kind of partnering with that then all of a sudden threw up, threw over acquisition offers. There, you know, in that you're kind of making the decision, well, gosh, we could probably raise maybe another $10 million around on our own. But you know, really if we want this to happen, we want to happen at scale. Maybe we should tuck into a larger company and just see this through. That's trying. You know, you've spent the last, you've basically sacrificed the last two and a half years of your life getting to that point. And now the best options in front of you seem to be the ones that remove your control. You know, it's not what you, it's not what you started the company but, but again, if, you know, for us, it was very much one of that look. What matters most is that what we're doing sees a lot of day and has impact in the market. And so we seriously entertain a lot of that. For a while, we entertain those, those, those bids. And then, the diligence had the conversations of soul searching times to be sure. And then, then what happened then, Randy, who was on our board, again, I think got so excited about it all. He kind of said, okay, yes, we could raise a small round and kind of go to loan, but we're just not going to make it. It's just, you know, he amongst most knows you need a lot of capital to make changes in these spaces. The acquisition offers, well, yes, that's probably barring our internal round the best way is to go ahead and be acquired, make it happen. But even then, then you run the risk that you just get us, you just get us, you're subsumed by a big company. And everything that you've tried to build doesn't actually get out there. And so he suggested, hey, how about this instead? I'll lead, I'll lead the sea round. I'll bring in a bunch of investors and we'll, we'll fund this thing and we'll do it right. We'll go, we'll go for the long shot, we'll go for the big win, we'll go all the way. And you know, this is going to take $300 million. And so let's do that. And you know, turns out that's the way we went. That was certainly the right call for his pains, of course, he was going to be CEO instead of me. And that's where that you kind of all came in, it's like, okay, you know, which door do you go through? What are your personal incentives? It all kind of came back to, again, if you wanted to get, if I wanted to get this done, this team who would join me wanted to get this done. This was definitely the best way to do it. It meant taking a smaller piece of a bigger pie, it meant giving up control of the company, it meant a lot of things that you, you know, at the time were tough. But honestly, I mean, looking back, there was no other way to do this. There was no other way to do this. That was the right way to go. And I think that's where, you know, I want to, on that point in particular, I, today, I talked to a lot of entrepreneurs that are in that tweeter phase of the company. They got some funding, they're getting going, and they're making these decisions and they know they need the money, but that means losing control. They know they need a partner, or it, but it means partnering, you know, I would say, that is a key point in the, if you're going to start a company, that is going to be a key challenge as you start to succeed. Again, if you want my advice, the best thing to do is do what's right for the mission. Remove yourself from the equation, that's the best way to succeed. I've seen people get all tied up in what their percent ownership it is. It's, you know, my vision, my company, we're going to do it my way. That's a tough, that's a tough path to continue. For everything that we read about in the public media, how that's the, you know, obviously, the one or two of those, the unicorns that make it out, and that's the case, that's all we ever read about, but I can assure you, the thousands of other companies, you know, most of which die on the vine, that is not the way it works. You've got to be willing to sacrifice your own personal ambitions and desires for the mission at hand. So then we, so at that point in time, we raised, we raised a, you know, it's a good size sea round. Certainly more than we ever raised in the A and B. Things started working. We started adding more teammates, and this is where, again, this is where the team comes into play, you know, you want to bring in people that then can keep moving the company through the next phases, right? And they're going to be different people than the people you started a company with. They're going to have different skill sets. They're going to come from different backgrounds, and in a tight knit, kind of, you know, no safety net environment like a startup company, they're going to seem like they're from a different planet to you and much of your team. But it's essential. It's essential that as the company scales and grows, you add these people. And that's what we did. We started getting ready to, you know, we had proven commercial success. Again, the technology risk was peeled off a while back. We had started proving commercial success, and now it was time to start building an organization that could really go out and go after it. So there was a period of rapid company building, a lot of different skill sets showing up. The other thing that happened, you know, starts happening at that time. So now we have access to more and more capital. More and more capital is coming in, which then starts opening up the decision set. So kind of up until then, you know, every month was basically a race against dying as a company. You know, we have nine more months of cash. We need to prove this, this, and this. We have six more months of cash. We have three more months of cash. We have no more cash. Our bridge loan takes us one more, you know, four more weeks, six more weeks, eight more weeks. Then all of a sudden you've got more money than you ever thought you would have. You've got a bigger team around you. And now the questions get a lot harder. It's terms of, okay, now how do you create value for the next round of investment? Or do we need to get going, thinking about going public? Can we get to breaking before then, you know, and in that period of time, with many more voices around the table, it can get a bit crazy. And indeed, in our, you know, that middle, kind of maybe this is about two years ago, in our company's history, there were a lot of ideas about a lot of different directions to go. I mean, you know, should we go this way, more direct to consumers, should we go, you know, absolutely hardcore traditional clinical, should we go somewhere in between, should we just skip the U.S. and it's crazy third party reimbursement system and go, you know, go outside of the country. Let's go to Latin America. Let's go somewhere where there's actually a market for this information instead of this bizarre, you know, like I call it the regular insure, you know, the regular insure industrial complex that kind of, it just storts markets in this country for diagnostics and these technologies. We can talk about later if you have questions, but, you know, maybe we should do that instead. And those, you know, those again, you know, those are tough times. Now you're burning, you're now you're burning on a monthly basis what you used to spend a year. You've got a lot more people coming in, the culture that you're trying to build from day one gets challenged consistently. And you know, there was a period starting about this time, this stat has continued with us even today at our company and in VT day today, more than half the company has shown up in the last six months, right? So of a company we've been around for five years and more than half of our head count is here six months ago. And that started about in this period of time, about two, two and a half years ago. And what we're trying to do, you know, we're trying to build a different culture. I'll talk a little bit more about it. We're trying to build a different place, a different way of working. And of course when you're growing that fast with all these new ideas and all these new people coming in, that comes under serious, serious pressure. And that's so all that's coming together at that time. And again, to get through that time, I just keep, as I think back on it, it keeps coming back to the people around you. You know, you have excellent, smart, passionate people around you. You have very experienced hands around the table, both working with you on the management front and on the investor front. You know, so we started bringing in these blue chip investors that have been in the space for a while. They had seen a lot that were long-term investors that really got us through that time. And got us to the point where then it was time to think about, you know, we had now achieved enough commercial success and by the way the markets were hot enough. I mean, I'm thinking of down market retough. But, you know, we could actually see, hey, we can start raising more and more money. We could even think about getting the public markets to really continue to accelerate, continue to lower the prices, continue to make this happen. And you know, in the back and forth of all this, that's what we decided to do. We started gearing up to do it. Right before that, you know, kind of at the end of that period, we went out, we went on to raise, you know, kind of our last private round or the way it works today, there's this kind of, since the Jobs Act, there's a lot more action from what traditionally have been called mezzanine investors or early IPO investors. They also now are investing in kind of basically the last private round of public companies. So we begin talking to those firms, which I would say, you know, that really started focusing our attention on what is our story going to be as we go out to access the public markets. And again, our team helped us, the team we had added, you know, we couldn't have done it without them, no way. The investors that we had added along the way, we couldn't have made it happen without them. You know, interesting little story. We actually went out, did kind of the non-deal road show, we were out raising the private round, you know, with the bank, we had the bankers involved, we actually had at one point, we were going out to raise, you know, 50 million or so, had a lead, we're about to close it, and then, you know, literally on a Friday afternoon, the banker called on a call and said, oh, you know, sorry guys, lead fell through, you know, you know, big, big, big mutual fund X is starting to wonder what's going on, huge hedge fern Y wants to know where are we, are we going to close soon? You know, very quickly, what looked like a pretty good, like let's raise 50 million, it was all coming together, fell apart in a matter of minutes. That was harrowing to say the least. That's a period of, you know, your burning a ton, you know, it's not like back at the first, you know, early rounds when you're burning, you know, a couple hundred K a month. You know, you have a financing fallout then, and maybe everybody sours on the story, and all of a sudden, you're like going back to the company, firing a hundred people, you know, not good, not good at all. But you know, the team rallied, again, we've got pros around the table, you know, the team rallied, and we, you know, we ended up actually turning into a major, major win. Very quickly, we found another lead, which is actually even better than the first lead we had. And instead of raising a 50 million, a 50 million dollar round, we ended up closing a hundred and twenty million dollar D round. And I think that's one of those things kind of, is I think about that financing itself, kind of, it's a lot of the experience. Now, that's a financial effort, but I think the same thing has happened on the technology side as we've been working on different ways to look at this sequence information, get it into the clinic, different ways to run the pipeline. A lot of the failures that we've had very, very quickly got turned into wins that were even bigger than the failure we experienced. And I think that's, you know, part of the programming that I would suggest, you're going to need to have, you're going to face a lot of adversity, you're going to have a lot of downs with your ups. And you know, you and the team around you, your natural reaction needs to be, okay, now what do we do? How do we fix it? How do we get going? How do we preserve? And again, I keep coming back to, in my mind, you know, every single one of those kind of circumstances that we hit along the way, that is possible when everybody is on the same page and everybody's passionate about the mission and everybody can suspend what it means for them. Oh my God, we just, we, we're about to bail out of our D round, what's going to happen, what's going to happen to me, what's going to happen next, all of these relationships are going to fall apart. Instead, everybody was dead set focused on, no, no, no, no, this, we need to make happen. You know, our clients are loving us, the patients are getting the results, like we are going to make this happen, we are going to make it happen, we're going to pull it out. And I think of, you know, the, the D round financing falling through a bunch of technology foul ups along the way that we had, every single one of those, when you started, you know, again, it's kind of back to when you're facing that failure and then the team rallies around it and the team always rallies around it for the right reasons. Not only do I, I suggest to you that is absolutely critical in building a business that, that, hopefully, again, I wouldn't say we're going concern yet, but looking good so far, you want to build a business to that, to that point, you're going to have to have that. And again, it comes back to the kind of like, this is why I'm encouraging you to do it. Those experiences pulling through with a team for something that is absolutely important that the world needs, even if you don't succeed, even if it does end up in failure, that alone is worth it from my perspective. And I can look, I can honestly look back and I think, I think I can be honest with myself, even in the darkest times along the way the last five years. Every time we were in a downtime, I still, you could come into work and remind myself, I would do this again. If we don't close the bridge around, if we don't close the sea round, if, you know, what just, what I just got, what just came out of the lab yesterday, if that, if that ends up tanking us, I would do it again. Every single one of those times, I could always, you know, I think, I mean, it's hard when you're there, but I think honestly looking into myself, I kept coming back with, I would still do it again. Even if we fail crash and burn the next week, I would do it again. And I can tell you now, even if along the way, you know, it's easy to say now, we've gone public and, you know, we're kind of making a go at it. But I can, I can honestly say, I would do it again, even if every time along the way there was a chance for failure, even if it happened, I would totally do it again. Let's see. So, so then, so along the way, we're having commercial success. This was really kind of, we had only been commercial for about nine months, almost a year at that time. We brought in Chief Commercial Officer, really built the team up, but still a really small effort, but we were making great traction. So we decided after the D-round to immediately go and load up again and, and, and access the public markets. And this, I think, you know, kind of all along the way, I had been receiving, you know, from the very, very beginning with no money and no space all the way up until that point in time. I'd received plenty of advice from a lot of people about fundraising. And what I, what I would offer to you is, is the following, I think kind of, there are two flavors of advice for entrepreneurs on fundraising. And one, I think, if I may vastly over generalize, one comes from fairly wealthy people that don't have to work and think very deep thoughts about the optimal way to raise money and build companies. And the other comes from people that aren't independently wealthy and have to use other people's money and just want to get something done. And I would say that the levels of advice go something like, you know, this, on this side is kind of like the, you know, big piece of small plies better. You want to optimize every stage of value creation and only take so much to lose the long way. And, you know, if you have cash, make sure to increase the value before you raise more cash. And on the other side is, is the simple advice of take as much money as you can when you can, because you never know what's going to happen tomorrow. And I just got to tell you, again, one man's perspective, that is the voice to listen to. And even right after the de-run, we had just raised $120 million. And the very next question was, hey, I think we can get to the public markets. Let's do it. Let's do it right now while we can, because this is going to take a lot of money and if we want to ensure success, that's what we're going to do. And so we did. So we got, we got geared up. We got geared up. We went into, in our industry, there's a big conference at the beginning of the year, the JP Morgan Healthcare by taking a healthcare conference. Kind of went into that, having just announced, okay, we're going to go do it, kicked off the road shows. And then, you know, the great thing about the road shows is that we had just raised $120 million. So we've been out talking all these firms and a lot of them had just come in and then we got some more interested, closed around, closed the IPO in mid-February and took the company public, came back to the company, had a big party. And I'll admit, it was entirely surreal the whole thing. You know, on the one hand, it's been the longest five years of my life. I think I've aged 20 in those five years. On the other hand, it just seems like yesterday we were literally in that trace of obviously key Latation Room kind of like, oh, you know, this could possibly work maybe not. How long do you have? I don't know how long do you have? Well, let's keep trying. Let's see if we can go. It really has been surreal. And again, I think reflecting on it, well, and the first thing I would tell you too is right now it's actually the way we viewed it's kind of just the beginning. You know, we're making a great ramp commercially. Our value proposition is really selling. Again, it's kind of like, hey, you're currently ordering and paying for these genetic tests that are very expensive and slow. Why not come to us and have them be very, very fast and better and much, much cheaper? You know, it's an easy sell, mostly. But it's really early days. It's a big market, it's a complex market. Like I mentioned, the payer system's difficult. There's a lot of challenges ahead of us. But you know, it would seem certainly from my part, I think from my perspective, where we are now is maybe a, not, I wouldn't label it success, but it's kind of like, you know, for me it's all of the people that came and joined, all of the people that took massive career risk on what we were trying to do. You know, minimally, it looks good on their resume now. Hey, that company went public, I think, yeah, that's great. You know, minimally, it is some kind of like, hey, okay, this is working well enough where there's enough people interested, they're willing to invest in the idea. And what I think is most interesting is, in these big funds, these big hedge funds, these investors, what was really satisfying to me, and this again comes back to this concept that I'd love for you to take away about the mission. The best thing was, so there's one woman that runs this massive, massive fund, very big, important fund in Boston. And you know, to come in and be prepared for the pitch and the questions and everything, and to basically have her kind of go, you guys have made my day. I have been looking for something in healthcare like this for years, and I don't know why anybody gets it. If the technology is falling, prices are falling off the map. Why isn't the care getting cheaper? Why isn't it getting better? Why aren't patients getting this? And it's kind of like, you know, to have someone like that in your corner, which by the way, a lot of our investors are exactly the same way. You know, again, it makes it all worth it, it makes it all better, and you know, I think we're genuinely at the point now where even if we do fail, you know, prices in the industry have come down since we came on the scene. Turn around times have come down since we came on the scene. There is no question anymore whether or not people will do genetic panels or gene tests or whatever. You know, that question is now settled. It is now a race. Anybody who needs genetic tests will get one much, much faster. You know, and I think not just because of us, again, a lot of industry participants that are taking part in this, but in a large part because we stuck it out there and said, this is the way the future is going to be. These things are going to be cheap and available. The margins are going to be low, and it's going to be a real consumer market for this kind of thing. You know, in a sense, we have succeeded no matter what happens at this point, and of course, now the game is to make it successful going forward. So maybe one last thing, and then we can go to questions. I think that the point that I mentioned is obviously I've been kind of pointing out this mission, that the burning desire to do something has got to be front and center. Again, for all the sacrifices you're going to make to make it happen, and for all the chances of failure, you've got to have it mean something. And then even in the success, I can assure you that success has nothing to do with money or going public or anything. The success is, like I mentioned, the people you're interacting with saying, this is awesome. This is an idea. Thank you for making it happening. We now are kind of doing some work with some advocacy groups, and we just recently had one of these advocacy group heads. Her family has been affected. And to sit down and have her just kind of pour out her heart and say, I can't believe this and this and this and this and we need this and we need this. It's just a crime. This doesn't happen. And just to say, we got it. We're doing it. Yes. Next year, yes. The price. You know, that is where the success really feels like success. One of the other stuff feels any different than when I was at my old job or when we were starting or when it was clear it was possible we were going to fail. It's what you're doing that matters the most. The team that you build is what matters the most. And then I had mentioned that I felt it was really important to pay attention to how you're building the team and how you're running it. So this is kind of, well, I think it's interesting. So we started the company. And again, it was a bunch of technology people and we were really excited and excited and we were really excited and excited. The other thing is kind of across my mind, you know, we had all worked at many places. I had run fairly large units at companies before and it kind of came. Hey, while we're out trying to do this, why don't we also try to create a company that we actually like working at? Why don't we try to build a company where people enjoy coming to work every day and build a company where maybe if we do possibly one day have success and grow to be a 10,000 person company, it actually is not your typical big, slow company. Let's try to do that. And it was kind of a personal desire that a lot of the co-founder shared to do that. It was also a rational desire. I think, you know, kind of as I sat back at the time and as I certainly as I think today, you know, in observation about the world, kind of lately, technology cycles are getting really, really, really fast. Workforces are getting very, very distributed. Competition is popping up. I mean, yes, I think it's going to be hard to recreate Silicon Valley. But boy, there is a lot of global talent pouring into basically thinking about as, you know, entrepreneurial capacity on just about any industry you can think of and I can see it happening. And so kind of one of the other ideas is not only like why not build a place that's really great to work at that we would like to work at that, you know, people don't run around basically afraid of their bosses all the time. Why don't we build a company that can actually innovate at scale because I actually think this is going to be important. If we're going to have to stay on these technology cycles and if we're going to have to stay, cut it, you know, bleeding edge and access global talent, you know, it's going to have to work differently than most companies work today. So we tried some things early on. We actually, we didn't have an org chart until 120 people. We didn't have any titles at all. We still don't have titles. We now have SEC mandated titles, but internally, you know, we don't have titles that convey rank or entitlement or whatever, the very functional practical titles. We built a, one of the first things that I did when we got the A round, no, this was maybe when Randy joined the board. When we built the board, we built this little survey system where the team would basically do three six reviews of each other and especially me. And then that would get published to the board and kind of, you know, the team could basically either with their name attached or anonymously, you're rate me and how we were doing and where we were going and was it working. And that system is actually evolved and over time and now we actually have it in full play. Our, we don't have peer reviews at the end of the years. You know, our manager, anybody who's a manager, we really want them just focusing on execution and mentoring and getting things done. And we have a separate group, which is our talent ops group and we have this system that we've built that is essentially like a statistical, interpersonal, you know, kind of basically a performance evaluation survey that's completely 360. We gather many, many, many, many data points throughout the year and are especially interested in how I'm doing, how Randy's doing, how the, how the leads are doing. And so it's completely upside down of kind of how most, most companies kind of do personal reviews. Who's doing what? Who gets paid what? And we have a lot of opportunities who doesn't. You know, we've, we've, we've implemented a lot of unusual features into, into the way we operate to preserve some of that early, early kind of nimble, you know, nimble, the ability to be nimble, the ability to challenge the ability to chase ideas. And I think, you know, like I said, we spent a lot of time on it in the early days and I felt at the time this is probably too much. And now though that we're, you know, getting to 250 people with half the company, you know, as I've been here more than six months, I'm really, really glad we spent as much time doing that because I've actually really been delighted to see some of the core cultural elements that, that certainly I like about our company and we think are going to be important for the company. Have not only survived, they're starting to bake in and people are really starting to grab on to them as one of the major reasons they like to work there. Work here. And honestly, if we hadn't paid as much attention to it early on, it wouldn't have happened. We would have faced what I talked to many, many entrepreneurs about, many, many founders about is that, you know, the tragedy of seeing this great thing and as you achieve success, it starts getting away from you, which again, you know, to an extent it will and that's good. But then seeing the culture go and seeing the bureaucracy set in and the fire go away, you know, for me, again, I would, you know, as you're starting a company, I resort you to pay a lot of attention to the type of people you're bringing in and how you intend to operate and manage those people over time. So that's kind of a view, you know, from start to finish, that's my personal perspective of what has gone on at NV data last five years. Yeah, I mean, like I said, I'd love to grab questions from anybody. Sometimes your questions are much more interesting than what I have to say. So yeah. Did you in the last five years, did you have any big pivots or was it just a linear execution? No, we knew what we were doing from day one and no. Yes, of course, yes. And I think this is universal. And anybody I've talked to that has done this at, you pivot at some point. Early on, it was very much, and the large part because of capital constraints, it was going to be kind of a B2B type play. We were going to build the technology engine and then basically offer it as a B2B play to LabCore and Quest and Miria and these other players and enable them to lower the prices and expand the menus. When Randy started getting involved, when the market started shifting our direction, it became clear this is happening fast and it's going to be much more of a foot race. That's when we decided, that's when one major pivot was, okay, we're going to go all the way to the clinician, all the way to the patient, build a brand in the space and build the whole thing, souped nuts, which of course was going to take 10 times more capital than the B2B play. But that was a major pivot and that's also what increased the complexity of the company, increased the size of the company. That was a major pivot. We, in that period I mentioned about two and a half years ago, we were seriously considering going full blown, I wouldn't say non-medical but really pushing the bounds of the, our position, our relationship vis-a-vis the current medical establishment two and a half years ago, we were really debating which way to go and we were pretty close or I think seriously entertaining, maybe we needed to go around it, started gearing up to do so but then quickly pivoted back and said, no, let's stick to our guns, the only way this is going to be impactful for those families and those kids in those waiting rooms in any time in the near future is to get the medical community going on it, serve their needs as well as the patient's needs and get going. I'd say those are the two major, one certain pivot and one that was an almost pivot that we quickly pivoted back. Yeah, absolutely. It sounds like what the key factors of success is the work you had and the determination. So my question is, is that based on just your natural innate ability or is it, do you have techniques to kind of keep going after maybe so many knows that you're initially gone? We have a big question. I think the question was kind of like, sounds like it takes a lot of grit and determination, are you just insane or was that some kind of choice you made along the way? I think those who work with me probably think it's a little of the former but I'm not sure. I think a lot of things in life come down to choice and will. If you really want to do it and you decide you're going to do it, then it's just a matter of sheer will. Yes, yes, to do it, you're going to be, your will will be tested. Actually, the whole fundraising process, someone mentioned it to me at the time and now it makes total sense. It's a bizarre way that people go about raising money. But someone once said, actually, it's a pretty good test for the next years to come and actually now it totally makes sense to me. Being kicked in the teeth all the time, it's a bad idea, getting strung along by VCs, it has no interest in investing at all. That's actually a pretty good testing ground. You can do that for a year or so. You just might be able to build a company and grow it. Yeah, in board or learned, I don't know, but I prefer to think of it as if you find something that you really care about and you choose to go try to address it, try to make that difference. You know, yeah, you've got to make some choices. You will have to make sacrifices. I'm also not a believer in you can have it all. You want to go do something like this, you build a company, you better simplify your life because you aren't going to have a whole lot of time. You better figure out what's important, focus on that and then make it happen. And yeah, you're going to have to work through a lot to see it through. It's face a lot of self-doubt and face a lot of challenges. But again, that's kind of the awesome thing about it. That you don't often get an opportunity to really do that. John, thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you.
