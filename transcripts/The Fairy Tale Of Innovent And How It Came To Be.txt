 You are listening to the Draper Fisher-Jurvinson entrepreneurial thought leader seminar brought to you weekly by Stanford Technology Ventures program at Stanford University School of Engineering. Stephanie Keller-Bottom is a classic example of an entrepreneur who has done her work in global companies and also bridging between global companies that are very innovative and the startups that need to work with global companies in order to bring their products and services to market. How many of you carry a Visa card? Hands up in the audience. Okay, well you've been touched by the technology that Stephanie influenced when she was doing innovation and strategy for Visa back at an earlier part in her career. How many of you have a product somewhere at home or maybe on your person from a company called Hewlett Packard? A few people who are using technology and products and services from HP as well. Stephanie also helped with the innovation and the strategy of that very interesting global company at a time when it was actually edits doing a very nice job of growing and innovating back in the mid to late 90s. And then Nokia stole her and Nokia, how many of you have a Nokia handset or some sort of Nokia device that you made? That's pretty good share. So, which I think is right on with the global average? We think Silicon Valley might be a little bit higher than some other parts of the world but who knows. So if you think of what would be a really cool career to have it would be to help startups who are trying to figure out how to work with these big global companies to do innovative things to change the world and that's really what Stephanie's been doing through most of your career. So we're delighted to have you here with us. Stanford can't wait to hear what the story is about and let's welcome Stephanie here to ETL today. Thank you. Of course Bill Gates makes sure that everybody has to stop and pay him homage before any presentation can go forward and in this particular circumstance it is doing just that. While it's deciding that it's going to work for us let me tell you that I appreciate the invitation to speak here. I am first generation to the United States. My father is about 90 years old and when I told him I was speaking at Stanford when he quit laughing because he couldn't quite believe it because he doesn't understand what I do. He proceeded to ask me a number of questions about what would I have to offer a group of Stanford students and so I hope when you leave the room you could answer my father's question if he should find you on the street and ask you if you listen to his daughter please tell him yes you did get something out of this because I'm afraid he would be so disappointed and I do appreciate being here so what I want to do is spend the next half an hour talking to you about what in-event is and what we do and given that you are brilliant students in varying careers of your development we're not going to use what you're used to which is the case study. Everybody uses a case study I just see one young man there went yeah please don't we're not going to use a case study today we're going to use something a little bit different we're going to use a fairy tale to talk about in-event because people in general in the industry an external to the industry can't really believe that a model like this exists and so for a while people are not quite sure what we do and how we do it and why it's so different so I'm going to tell you the fairy tale of in-event and how it came to be and then we're going to talk about what that means to the generation of entrepreneurs that are sitting in this room and that ultimately will follow you and I'm going to keep it to about 30 minutes so that we can have a discussion afterwards you can see I'm not technology oriented once upon a time in the kingdom of large companies there was a real pressure on earnings and all of a sudden companies about 10 to 15 years ago started talking about this topic of innovation what did it mean and it wasn't driven by the fact that companies loved to create new things what companies love is consistent reporting to their shareholders and to Wall Street and they don't like to miss forecasts so as companies like Nokia like Motorola like PNG like Boeing across industries begin to grow they experience double digit growth perhaps for 10 to 15 years which Nokia has done Nokia is a hundred and thirty-year-old company and how many of you here know what the word Nokia means and how many of you know what Nokia started to do when it first was a company actually it was a rubber boots and paper products company a hundred thirty five years ago and the word Nokia is a river it's a river in Finland where the first factory was built so in this kingdom of Nokia that started out as a rubber and paper products company they changed their company from rubber and paper products and leveraged base station technologies because when people talk about the frozen tundra they're talking about Finland and so for large expanses of geography you don't have telephone communication lines so the need for connectivity and communication gave rise for a very small company to grow over 15 years to one that had about 43% of the market share globally is the second largest provider of GSM networks in Europe and is considered to be one of the premier product innovators but this company as most large companies began to notice that they really needed to begin to address that they were becoming a commodity in the market anybody that produces product ultimately becomes commoditized if they don't move innovation forward so this is a a funny little way of saying in corporate cultures in kingdoms sometimes all the king the king and all of his men or women don't realize what they're going to do to create the next generation and that's where in event was in this kingdom in event was created we were created about five years ago under the auspice of the executive management team in Nokia led by at the current time Pecola Pietro the president of Nokia and what they wanted to do was to broaden Nokia's vision to create a company that was focused around the needs of the consumer and that built their product from the consumer out instead of from the technology in and so how does one do that one needs to get very broad market perspective so we created an event with a hypothesis that there is no king or kingdom that can actually grow without acquiring external knowledge and being able to take that knowledge and integrate it with the core competencies that reside in its own kingdom so Nokia needed to reach out to a different community to get their perspective to understand how to change and evolve so that they could continue to lead the communications revolution and how effective Nokia is at that depended upon the way in which we approach the market and you are the people in the room that represent the market that we decided to go after and that was we wanted to leverage the entrepreneurial market the small startup company and I'm not talking about the small startup company of 40 people that's already received series a financing I'm talking about those of you that are taking your ideas putting them on the back of a napkin perhaps you've then raised friends and family money and you've maxed out your credit cards and now you really want to take your idea to the market but you're not quite sure how to do it in order for us to appeal to that market we actually had to look at ourselves and say what do we need to do differently than we're doing now and what we recognized was that we had to develop a model that was a mirror of what the entrepreneurs were the only way you can talk to an entrepreneur is by speaking their language just like any two different cultures if you can't agree on a common language with Francois you can never communicate with each other so by design we are a group who has the attributes of an entrepreneurial startup versus a corporate venturing or strategy organization and what does that mean number one we are predictive in future based which means that we are not looking for what's going to produce revenue in two years we are looking for the disruptive innovation that perhaps is five years away from actually moving from a beachhead market entry strategy into the mass market what that means is we're going to face the same challenges any startup would how many of you here have ever dealt with venture capital people to get investment money those of you that are still living I congratulate you because it's a very difficult task for a startup all respect to dfj there are good organization as many are but everybody faces the same challenges when dealing with investors the first thing is your very your market is very uncertain if you're three to five years out I don't think there's anybody that could clearly predict that they know the path to ROI secondly there's going to be gaps in information while you are trying to determine your market entry strategy based on who your consumer is whether it be enterprise or consumer there's going to be gaps when you try to figure out who your competitors are or who your ecosystem partners really need to be and so information evolves and investors are always asking you tell me tell me tell me tell me tell me we face the same thing when we deal with our entrepreneurs no key always asks us tell me tell me tell me so we serve as an information gap filled in the information gap we have soft assets and if people know you know what soft assets are their things like can you create a brand what is your intellectual capital before it becomes protected by IPR what is your team like what is your network like those are very soft assets but they're vital to an entrepreneur and as I said your market is very volatile there is only prediction and the acceptance of risk in our companies there is no certainty and as I mentioned one of the most important things is that we do not believe there is any company in today's market that can move quickly enough to create a product and control the market we believe that you must collaborate today you have to have an ecosystem of players that you will share incentive with what that means is nobody gets a hundred percent of the pie anymore if you're going to go to market you need to go to market with an understanding that negotiations are no longer about control they're about collaboration and entrepreneurs understand that very well they understand it sometimes better than most corporations and they also understand how to leverage resources what that means is in large corporations there's a lot of money and so ideas tend to keep going even when perhaps there's no merit because people are intellectually invested in the idea now what that means for the entrepreneurs is that they bring a ruthless market discipline to a large corporation like Nokia think about it if you're an entrepreneur and you're not getting market traction because you don't understand your customer and you have nobody that goes into prototype with you you have nobody that's going to pile it with you you're never going to get to revenue now large companies would have a tendency to keep going and keep burning money to get the idea fruition entrepreneurs can never do that so they move quickly and what it does is it forces the hand of the corporation to move at the speed of an entrepreneur and so that's an enormous amount of value that is brought and then finally the in-event model was really designed to mitigate risk I'm sure most of the people in the room here have heard of real options theory who's ever worked with real options theory past black sholes okay look forward to it you'll enjoy it it is really a science by which the more uncertain your solution is the higher the value of the investment so in investment terminology it means that you place a number of small bets and you hope that one of those bets which you have placed allows you as seated a table to play the game when the market really starts to move and since you don't know which market's going to move or what's what solution is going to be the right solution you're paying to play and we can do that very nicely under this model because we invest small we invest early and we do it is such a degree that when we do get you into a series a round there are no terms in there that are going to prevent somebody like dfj or Sequoia from coming in and going into an a round with you so you help us mitigate our risk and we help you mitigate yours and so as we grew up we were born three years ago four years ago in terms of actually entering the market as we grew up we learned a lot about creating what we call these risk or growth options we have not committed to Nokia that we create new businesses because if you commit that you're creating new businesses all of a sudden you find a target that says in two years you want two hundred million dollars in sales let me tell you that there's no company that's produced two hundred million dollars in sales in two years unless they've acquired revenue so that's a very unrealistic target and we didn't want to get stuck in a situation where we were being measured by the wrong metrics and then setting our entrepreneurs up for failure so we don't commit new businesses and we don't say we're venturing because we're not venturing actually what we're doing is we're exploring so we've learned that when you position yourself as an exploratory vehicle in very early stage markets and you build it on the basis of a hypothesis we believe that this is what consumers are going to be looking for with respect to media consumption you tend to take corporate biases and you bring them down every corporation has a bias and it's generally around what their core business generates is revenue so nobody wants to challenge either the customer or the distribution channel that brings them revenue and that's across industries so when you start experimenting if you're experimenting in a new market and you're trying to do something that the company doesn't do today you're necessarily threatening the core business and that in a very strong environment will bring a lot of bias and it will bring a lot of resistance we were given the autonomy to actually separate ourselves from the core business base our investments on hypothesis versus a forecast of return and that allowed us to begin dealing with corporate biases in a very positive way we're efficient and I'm going to show you a chart of how efficient we actually are if you compare our exploration process to those of other methodologies as I said we spread our risk over a very diverse spectrum and our entrepreneurs represent a very diverse spectrum we have four time entrepreneurs the serial entrepreneurs they're called we have first time entrepreneurs and we have individuals that are actually under government funding so they've taken no institutional money they've taken government money and now they're wanting to go into their first round of investment financing for a corporation very diverse group of people and we are very disciplined this is a story of how what people think couldn't happen actually came to be but it's not a fairy tale in terms of having real soft processes we are a very disciplined innovation group we are probably as disciplined if not more than a number of other types of investors and as we grew up we learned how to play with others that's the most important lesson you learn when you grow up is how to play with others and this may sound like something very small but actually as you begin to build your own businesses what you're going to find is it's very rarely about the technology it's very rarely about your marketing what it's about is your ability to work with competitors as collaborators at one point it's about your ability to take people that are diverse and align their interests and directions and it's also about your ability to take a team that is very passionate and get them to change their point of view at varying times during your development of your business the cycle of development of your business so let me give you some things that we have found out about working with entrepreneurs and working with others so if you're an entrepreneur keep these things in mind as you start to pick your partners in your team you need to align yourselves and the most important thing is that you share the same values in direction now that means that if you believe that people are your most important asset don't partner with somebody that measures you by your head count and the amount of money that you're going to burn doing things that are important to people like pizza Friday okay you will learn that those things build your business very quickly some companies don't agree with that some do find the companies and the partners that most match the values that you and your management team have that is the most important element of success make sure that you have an exit strategy and we're going to look at a few numbers in a while that are going to tell you why today that's probably as important as it was in 2000 and 2001 and make sure that your assets are aligned meaning don't replicate competencies if you have the technology and you don't have the marketing don't find a company that actually has competing technology find one that has marketing so make sure you're bringing to the table complementors versus people that share your skills and then you will be able to move forward much more quickly get a very broad set of perspectives the first thing any entrepreneur should do whether they're going to partner with a corporation or not get an advisory board not your board of directors yet get an advisory board you need people a very interest legal technology finance governance and audit make sure you get people that are seasoned that ultimately may become your board but today they will help guide you in dealing with very large companies like Nokia like Oracle you need that kind of seasoning there are one of the most important things you can have get focused I don't know how many business plans we've seen where entrepreneurs are going to develop seven products at the same time and go to three different markets don't boil the ocean find a beach head strategy get focused and go for it because that will control your burn rate and that is absolutely critical when you're going to have a long cycle time to develop your market assume the capital that you get is the last that you're ever going to have so if you get a half a million dollars on your pre-series a round assume that that's the last that you're going to ever get because I guarantee you if you look at it from that perspective you'll never waste your money be flexible and take coaching when we meet with entrepreneurs when we sit in the room with them if they're uncouchable or they're not flexible about their ideas it goes to our values we will not deal with people that think they have all the right answers because nobody does and if you spend more time coaching the entrepreneur about their style you have less time to coach them about the really important things like how to define your market who's your customer what your financial structure and what your growth plan and then finally the first thing that you need to do the first investment that you make with the capital that you get should be a market positioning study every entrepreneur I know says they know who their customer is and they know how to get to market and when you ask them to create a market positioning strategy guess what they can't give it to you or they'll bounce from one market to the next the best investment that you can make straight up front is to get a market validation study done which will help you define who your first market should be what your pricing strategy should be trust me adequate pricing is not margin plus and it's also not the idea that your competitors pricing at this so you'll price it at this less why who knows what the famous saying is about pricing pricing has one way to go and that's down and that's a true ism so your market validation study will help you determine what your initial and your ongoing pricing strategy should be and you need to also understand sustainability one product does not create a sustainable revenue company and so as we grew up and we learned these lessons and we shared them with our entrepreneurs we began to see that we were very efficient and this is a very traditional trajectory of a new company all companies invest money at the beginning of their product development cycle so their financial risk is very high as the product gets to market they begin to get some return and this risk reduces but any of you that have taken product development courses understand that the original product that you produces never the product that goes out to the market it iterates and so the more risk that you can reduce here the faster your revenue and the less your iteration and product cycle costs are this is where we fit in this is where we are because we test the concept before it's ever prototyped and we do it in the real market with real customers and real entrepreneurs versus in a corporate market research environment so our trajectory is very much like the red one and I'm sorry about the eye chart but actually what this is is a study that was done by by Deville Epstein and Shelton in terms of comparing costs of organizations across the globe how much did it cost them to produce one project of radical innovation and what you'll see is the in-event line is in the US that's where we're based where the strike blue line and what you see is both in Asia the US and Europe we have the most effective radical innovation cost per project on any of the companies that they looked at this shows you how much leverage entrepreneurs provide because you are sitting at the center of the market and at the center of the problem not at the outside and that reduces innovation costs significantly and this was the one thing that corporations will always understand are you outperforming your peer group in terms of their investment so our median budget per type of innovation product is pretty impressive and that there were things that were happening while we were growing up that I think are pretty important because we're at a period of time today in 2005 where most of you have probably heard of that infamous internet bubble many of your parents probably you know didn't get their fourth vacation home because that you know sure filed the internet deal they had didn't come through we are now at the same levels of bubble period in investment and I'm going to show you some of these statistics because they should be pretty important to you all and then I'm in a close in a few minutes so that we can have time for questions if you look at this fundraising grew in 2005 while we were growing up and commitments to venture capital funds as you can see in 2005 are the highest that they've been since 2001 which was just on the internet bubble and there you can see that the deal flow and the equity that was actually placed in venture-bought companies in 2005 was the highest it's been since 2001 once again that bubble period and so what's generally going to happen when you do that and this is just I as I walked out my door this afternoon I picked up my venture wire and there was the update for the first quarter of 2006 so it's not in graph form but you can see that that trend is continuing and it's 18% higher than it was in the first quarter of 2005 there's a lot of money out there chasing a lot of transactions but few few really good ideas okay the deal count 6% over that's a fairly high margin once again the highest level of venture capital invested since 01 and up until this first quarter of 06 the IT sector had fallen behind there was less investment in IT and more investment in medical devices than anything else IT is hit a resurgence now in the first quarter and it's nine more transactions that have really driven that number and of course what happens when that happens there's two few ideas good ones a lot of transactions and a lot of money your valuation start going up and you can see that the trend is going to repeat itself that happened from 1999 2000 and 2001 really high valuations that are beginning to peak up very quickly and what that means for you as a future entrepreneur is understand when you have an investor the two of you need to agree which evaluation methodology is going to be because that's going to determine the amount of money that you make all right and it's cyclical it's not it is what people will pay for it it is what people will pay for it today but tomorrow it might be less so try not to get caught up in the internet bubble thinking even though investors will move you in that direction because that is not sustainable and we coach our companies to make sure that they understand what the valuation is going to be of their investors later stage companies meaning those companies that are in their series C round and probably getting ready to go into their exit their valuations have skyrocketed people want fast return so they'll invest in a C stage wait for 12 months get a very fast return and the green line that you see on the top 40.7 that's later stage transaction and those were companies that were actually developed in the late 90s so about five years late 90s early 2000s they're about five years old that's really how long it takes to develop a company that you can put a rational exit strategy around and that you can value fairly tangibly and it's again this is an aging of the companies and most of these companies were actually in business for 5.4 years and how do they get their their wealth event it's around M&A today everything today is around mergers and acquisitions and you can see that if you compare the IPO versus M&A in 1999 in 2000 this was the crazy IPO market you know pets dot com you know buy your water bowl over the internet that's what you see here was IPO and that was devastating to the investment market you will have a lot to say about how this market evolves in 2010 because the companies you start today will be the companies that go forward during that period of time and the gain is once again going up 2000 M&A price was very high one of the things the in-event model does is because we're working with the companies we can evaluate not only the team in the market but the technology it drives our acquisition cost down if we want to acquire the company we have a better idea of what their value is now importantly you need to understand that no key has no first right of refusal on these companies no key has acquired the companies in our portfolio and so of our competitors no key has invested in the first round of these companies and we've co-invested with competitors that's because it is purely market driven and that's to the benefit of the entrepreneur and that's a really important point to make because we want to know what a company is doing independent of our point of view we want to know what it's going to do in the market and then IPO activities regressed those people on Wall Street that did IPOs they're still not going to make as much money today as they did in 2019-99 once again that's vintage this is vintage 5.6 years if you were going to go IPO and the offering size shrunk significantly in terms of average dollars and good notice for you two out of five deals went to California and actually 35% in the Bay Area this is where the market is in the right place the right time you've got the right advisors and people around you what's fascinating to me is that New England is 13% and everybody considers that corridor there the Washington Beltway to be a real high opportunity area because of the Homeland Security money we have outperformed that vector since they started keeping statistics so Silicon Valley and the ecosystem that exists here is what drives the venture economy and it is where entrepreneurs need to be so the moral of our story is that the best way to learn about the future is to understand the past and for us that means we take the lessons that we get from our entrepreneurs and we build them into Nokia's corporate strategy we do not take these and then assume that we get a return in five years and move on this actually helps Nokia determine our corporate strategy it will also help you as an entrepreneur get validation of your business don't forget that looking at these numbers that I showed you should really help you determine what your growth strategy of your company is going to be look at the history understand the market see how it evolves because it is predictive of what's going to happen in the future beauty is in the eye of the beholder when some people see risk we see opportunity and you should be the same way because whatever filter or metric you put around your business you need to make sure that that's the same metric that your investor is going to evaluate you on never stop going at the goal after the the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow it's there sometimes sometimes it's not but I'll tell you getting there is half fun we certainly enjoy it we've taken our entrepreneurs out of our 19 companies three of them haven't made it we've learned just as much from them as we would have had they been successful and now two of them are starting businesses over again and we're investing them again so getting there is half the lesson and then finally if things are good to to good to be true generally they are be very deliberate in your activity keep your own council because when somebody approaches you or you approach somebody else and everything's perfect it never is and when you start digging into forecasts and sales numbers I can tell you that you'll learn a lot about whether your values align with your partner and so if it looks great look at it a second and third time make sure that you're the one that makes the final decisions because ultimately you're the one that's going to build the company and hopefully one of these days you'll be at CEO so that's the moral of our story and I'm open for questions yes I'm going to repeat the question the question is how are we measured internally in Nokia and I'll be real candid with you and tell you that that depends on the leadership in that particular year generally we are measured by what we consider to be a derivative what we've created is an innovation platform the value of any platform is the cost of the derivative you can build on top of it so the more we build on the basis of our existing platform the more successful we're considered so that's one very hard metric it's the derivative the the derivative on the platform and the next thing is can our companies actually prototype and build product which matches their IPR and Nokia's IPR together so can we closely integrate the activity of a startup and Nokia and and we do get measured on that number and there are some entrepreneurs that say you know I really don't want to do that because I'm concerned but most of the time we've developed a relationship where that's not the case so it's integration into Nokia how efficient we are building on the platform and I'd finally say what really determines whether or not we're successful is if the entrepreneurs come back to work with us again because without the entrepreneur we don't have anything yes the question is the kind of the structure of the portfolio size number type we've invested roughly four million dollars over three years we have about 20 companies in our portfolio so as you'll know we invest we invest small amounts our average investment is about 300,000 300 to 500 and we do stage that investment so as I mentioned to you we ask that the first part of the investment be directed into what we called the market validation studies out of our portfolio as I said Nokia is acquired a company one of our competitors has acquired them and ten of our companies are either in a B or C round with a major VC right now question is about what are the major trends in the mobile market and I would say that the key trend is that and this is Nokia's kind of vision is life goes mobile and so the idea is that you can access anything you want that's considered information and that's information for any purpose entertainment learning any place anywhere anytime so that's the standard answer what we're finding is the trend that our entrepreneurs are working on is the ability for people to create peering communities and to be able to take content that is created by the community and actually move into super distribution and so three years ago they called it peer-to-peer and you know it was Nutella and Napster all right today that kind of model is going mobile so if you develop music or a book or you're just taking certain things that are important to you you can take that and mobility distributed around your community and of course the same challenges face that model as it did in the wired model which is how do you make money off of it what's the digital rights management so it's about the distribution of content and the emergence of the community as the creator of the content is something that we believe is very strong right now the only carrier today that I'm aware of that's really becoming active in this market and it was in the New York Times last weekend is Vodafone and they're actually building on their venture capital organization in Walnut Creek and so we have yet to co-invest with a carrier because generally well two things one they're coming out of a period of time where they heavily invested in infrastructure and so there was not a lot of ancillary income to invest and secondly they tend to be focused more on an immediate return but I do know that Vodafone is actually making their presence known in the market and I believe Deutsche Telekom in Europe is also very active but we as an event have not invested directly with them yes the question was how do we work with core Nokia and with big mother Nokia and the question I'll ask to this group has anybody ever read a book called orbiting the giant hairball if you haven't go go go because that answers your question we orbit as close to the company as we need to to get our entrepreneurs what they need we then move away from the company to protect the entrepreneurs and get that feeling of trust that's necessary and then we orbit back to the company closely again to help create their strategy and to disperse knowledge and information and we do that in a number of different vehicles we actually hold portfolio days where we bring all of our entrepreneurs into Helsinki we bring the research division together with our entrepreneurs just for your knowledge Nokia Research Center is building a huge facility in Mountain View there we've discontinued all of our other US activities consolidated the sites and there'll be two sites one in Mountain View which will be very large and they'll be working with Stanford and one in Boston which will be working with MIT so the direct answer to the question is we orbit close and far away depending upon what we need to achieve at the time yes I just want to know this is a kind of two related question the first question is how do you like find you or how do you find companies like the answer each other and secondly like why would a company prefer you know in a vent over like another venture capital or a venture capital okay the question the first question was how do we find our entrepreneurs and the second one is you know what's our value proposition why would people want to work with us instead of a regular VC the answer to your first question is an extraordinary team in a vent has an extraordinary team of people that actually are in the market and active day in and day out sourcing new business and the characteristics of these people when they were recruited they had to have been an entrepreneur whether they failed or succeeded at running their own company they had to have been an entrepreneur and as I understand from Mike many people in here have worked for a startup we wanted people that had worked for startups because they know the problems and they know how to create a partnership that is sustainable so a great team we go to a lot of events we're part of a lot of consortium so the first thing is we source actively the next question is why us two reasons why us number one we don't take control either in our legal documents or in our approach so the entrepreneur remains the key decision maker so in our convertible note which is how we invest all right we don't take a controlling interest in the company when it converts to a series a round there is nothing in that structure that will prevent the series a investor from coming in and leading and I think the most important point is that traditionally when you invest with the VC they're going to put their own team in we believe that if you do that too early the people that are passionate about the solution become disenchanted and it never moves forward so in a series a we wouldn't be the appropriate people to invest with you would the VC is the right person then because you're at the right cycle so the simple answer is we give what the entrepreneur needs at the right time and then we allow we move allow them to move forward prosperously other questions okay well thank you very much I appreciated the opportunity to talk with all of you
