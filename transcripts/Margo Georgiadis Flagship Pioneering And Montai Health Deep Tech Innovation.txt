 This is the Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders Series brought to you by Stanford Equal. Welcome everybody to this week's Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders seminar. The Stanford seminar for aspiring founders. ETL is presented by STVP, the Stanford Engineering Entrepreneurship Center, and basis the Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students. I'm Ravi Belani, a lecturer in the Management Science and Engineering Department at Stanford and the Director of Alchemist and Accelerator for Enterprise Startups. And today I have the pleasure of welcoming Margot George Addis to ETL. Margot is a CEO partner at Flagship Pioneering. How many people know about Flagship Pioneering? Okay, so those who know know Flagship Pioneering is a singular, unique biotech VC fund that both invests in and builds platform companies that change the world. Think of companies like Moderna, the COVID RNA therapeutic vaccine. That came out of Flagship Pioneering as one of its companies. Margot is also the co-founder and CEO of a Flagship portfolio company Montaille Health, which is an AI platform company enabling the predictable discovery of breakthrough small molecule medicines to treat and preempt chronic disease. Margot grew up in Chicago and she got her bachelor's degree in economics at Harvard and then joined McKinsey as a business analyst out of undergrad. Two years after McKinsey, she went to business school at Harvard and then rejoined McKinsey for 14 years, rising up the ranks to become a partner in the retail and marketing practices. And then after that, after McKinsey, she had a dizzying array of, for me, which is like an unprecedented diversity of leadership experiences, including being the EVP of US Card Services and the CMO at Discover Financial Services. Then the president of America's and the vice president of Global Operations at Google. Then the CEO of Mattel, the toy company, and then also the president and CEO of Ancestry, the consumer genomics company. And then in 2022, Margot joined Flagship Pioneering and then also Montaille Health. In a field of tons of failed studio models, which we're all hearing about right now, Flagship is singularly stands out as one of the most notable successes and that sort of is testified by the size of their most recent fund, which is $3.4 billion. Margot also has received the Forbes Excellence Award in Innovation, Chicago's Innovation's Visionary Award, the Eastman Medal from the University of Rochester, just a dizzying list of awards, including the executive of the year at Utah and Crane's most powerful women in business and fortunes, 50 most powerful women in business. Margot also has three kids that are within your age. Her kids are between 20 to 29, including a son who's about to join the PhD program in the Material Science Department at Stanford. So without further ado, please welcome Margot. Oh, actually before we applaud Margot, the agenda is that Margot is going to give a quick presentation or talk and then we're going to follow it with a fire side chat and then we're going to have interactive student Q&A. As things are progressing, start thinking about your questions, lining those up just like last time. We'll try to pack in as many questions as we can. Okay, so now with that, you can give the applause. Please welcome Margot to each other. Applause. Good afternoon, everybody. It's great to be here and super inspiring to think about the next generation, as Robbie said. It's really fun for me. I'm actually excited to be here with Mo, who we used to work together at Google for many years and built a lot of great things there. And it's really fun to see all of you excited about becoming entrepreneurs yourself. So as Robbie said, I spent about half my career working in more traditional industries, doing a lot of innovation. You know, it dates me, but at the early age of CRM, I actually created the CRM practice at McKinsey, which was considered risky at the time. Did a lot of things in terms of the frontiers as we went into Internet, mobile, video, and building these platforms. And what I'm really here to focus on today is what it means to kind of entrepreneur at the edge and reimagine what's possible. So I'm going to share some of the principles that we use at flagship pioneering to repeatedly create these successful bio-platform companies in life sciences and sustainability. And then we'll have a FireStyle chat to talk a little bit more about some of my experiences as a CEO, as an investor and an entrepreneur. So I'm looking forward to your questions. So when I think about exploration and truly when you're leading at the edge, you think about yourself as being on that boat and truly losing sight of land. And there's this duality that exists because on the one hand, we're so excited about the potential that's out there. But at the same time, we have this trepidation of what we're going to find. And as entrepreneurs, what makes people successful is the ability to balance that emotion, to have the vision and the conviction to manage through those stormy seas and get to the other side and then be able to capitalize on that opportunity that you find. One of the most important concepts that we talk a lot about at flagship is the difference between risk and uncertainty. So when we think about risk, we think about things that are calculable. So if we're on that ship, what's the probability that we actually could survive different types of storms? That's something we can actually estimate. But uncertainty are those incalculable things. Because if I'm going to a new continent that I've never seen before and I have no idea when I'm going to get there and what I'm going to find, there's no way I can actually do that. That's true uncertainty. And it's thinking differently about that duality that we found really enables us to be more effective pioneers. And I wanted to read a stanza from a poem that's attributed to Sir Francis Drake, who's a renowned explorer from four and a 50 years ago. And I think it really highlights what we're all trying to do here as entrepreneurs. To dare more boldly to venture on wider seas where storms will show your mastery, we're losing sight of land, we shall find the stars. And I think that's what all of you hope to do as entrepreneurs. So let's talk about how you build the courage and the conviction to make that possible. So a lot of innovation focuses on the left hand side of this slide. Things around businesses that we already know, how do we improve that business model incrementally, make it more efficient, or how do we use innovations and data and technology to actually find adjacent opportunities. And these are spaces where we actually know the risk. But it's in areas like technology and biotech with the transformations that are happening in these industries that we're able to increasingly find these amazing red dot outliers. And that's a flagship what we exclusively focus on as leaders. And why do we operate beyond adjacencies? Well, we do it because there's the opportunity for a much bigger value pool. You also have less competition and you can define the rules of the game. You have a much more wide open space for intellectual property. And you have the ability often to partner more easily with incumbents because instead of replacing what they're doing, you're fundamentally additive. You're doing something new that they're not already doing. So they're really interested in identifying those new areas. And thinking about that is really important in terms of creating a new idea. But there are unique challenges to this pioneering approach. You have to deal with the fact that a lot of people will tell you it's impossible. Oh, I tried something like that before. It's not going to work. You have to overcome the dogma and you have to do it systematically and be okay with that. It can feel really lonely at times because you can't just go to a KOLs try something before. There's no playbook. You have to actually create it from the ground up. But I truly believe from my experiences at places like Google and flagship that this is the best C to chart. So let me unpack that a little bit more. So as I said, most innovation tends to be on the left hand side of this page. It tends to focus on a adjacency where there's less uncertainty and the risk is calculable. We could think about diversifying our bets and having a few shots on goal that we can actually estimate the probability of. But the problem that most people don't think about is you have the risk of innovation commoditization because other people can see that there's no opportunity because it's adjacent. So you're going to have more people that are structurally going after that, both incumbents as well as new companies. And so actually it ends up being riskier than you think. So just because you can calculate the risk doesn't mean it's less risky because your ability to capture value from those investments is then lower because there's more people going after the same opportunity. And that's still a fundamental simple concept a lot of people don't think about. On the other hand, what pioneering in the way we approach it enables us to make leaps to high uncertainty but do it in a way that you can go after that greater value at lower risk. So it actually becomes less risky to pioneer. And that's because we think really, we're talking about how do we do this differently? How do we take the risk out of the approach? How do we resolve uncertainty? And we do that by systematically identifying scientific proof creating new inventions that enable us to make those leaps and by building only multi-product platforms that take shots on goal. But the first shots we take, we just try to take them in lower risk initial areas that can then show the candy in the road to get to the bigger opportunity. And by doing that we have systematically found that we can unlock much more value with actually the same or less risk. And that's what we do at flagship. We've created an institutional approach to innovation where we pioneer new ideas. We entrepreneur these new capabilities to make them possible and then we scale them into companies. And everything we do starts with a very simple leap of faith. What if the world could be dramatically different, fundamentally at a science level in this area. So as Ravi said, my company is focused on something that if you're in life sciences you know is hard to say. How do we actually make small molecules predictable to develop? Right now they have a 7% chance of success on average in the clinic. But what if we could think differently using AI and more human qualified chemistry to unlock the beauty and the molecules that nature has already generated and use AI to match them into our pathways and make it much more efficient and predictable to make drugs. There are more tolerable for chronic consumption. It's a heriadescious idea and then we have to break it down into its principles and pursue it and we call that emergent discovery. We start really with an evolutionary process of the principles that it would underlie an idea. We generate different hypotheses for how you would actually prove that that's possible. And then we whittle it down and only the best ideas survive. And then as we build that platform, we reverse plan what is the story of the future and we back it up and we build it systematically. And we've made this entrepreneurship into an institution. In fact, I was first introduced to flagship pioneering when I was at Google because Google X was actually founded on the fundamental principles that new bar had created at flagship. How do you start with big what-if questions, how do you create explorations where you can systematically understand the pillars of an idea. How do you take those surviving ideas through the process of evolution and experts, use those to create protocols and then as you continue with very tight resources to evaluate your ability to succeed. And it's really interesting we actually don't give a company even a name until it becomes a new code because we don't want to fall in love with it. It's just a number because it's about proving what's possible in the fundamentals. It can't have any emotion in it. It has to be about facts and data. And then when we get a new code, then we actually bring in a more seasoned management team to step on the gas and really scale that into a company. And then it spins out, becomes a growth code. And to do that, we've really built a culture that enables us to be possible. It's based on four pillars being hyper adaptive. So how do we have this immigrant mindset where we're going to these new places where paranoid optimists that this idea is possible. And we are attacking it just relentlessly in terms of proving at a fundamental level and innovating to prove that. But then we are continuously learning in parallel. So we often pursue the idea in three or four ways at the same time to make sure that there isn't alternative hypothesis that could work equally as well. And then what we do is we actually grind that idea into a true platform that has scalability. And again, we're testing all those elements. And this is what's enabled us to do this a hundred times. So we've created a hundred different companies. 30% of them has gone public. Is Ravi said probably the most famous that you guys all know is Moderna, but there's probably many other companies on this page that you've heard of. All of them were based on fundamental science that was created in flagship pioneering innovative teams that came at these problems and put together diverse scientists and people from all different backgrounds to make them possible. So that is kind of the foundation and hopefully that's a helpful set of frameworks as you think about your pioneering journey. Margot, thank you. That was there's there's so much there to unpack. And there's lots of different things that I want to cover before I dive into. I want to really click on just understanding how to build these deep tech ventures before I dive into that. I would be remiss if I also didn't put a spotlight on just the diversity and the depth of your background. So I don't think we've ever had a speaker at ETL who has been the president of Google, the CEO of a toy company, Mattel, and now the CEO of a deep tech biotech company. And so I'm curious if you can spill your secret as to why you are such a singularity. And in particular, are there any either mindsets or skills that you treasure that you think are central to your ability to laterally jump into all these amazingly diverse fields and lead as a CEO. Thanks for asking that question. You know, I do think my career looks very random, but there is a golden thread that connects through all of it, which is I'm a lifelong data and technology nerd. And I've really been focused on how do we reimagine ecosystems of all types. In fact, my first job was as an economist building computable general legal or real models of economies. So how did you think about all the macro and micro decisions? So I used to go around in patty fields five miles from the nearest dirt road, as well as sit with the minister of finance and the food logistics agency to understand all those connections. So hopefully that makes sense. So if you think about what was happening in a lot of industries, when I was at McKinsey, it was really about how do we better have traceability on understanding customers and the traceability of our economics, relationships, and behaviors. And so we were reimagine ecosystem in retail and financial services and healthcare. And so I built a practice there that really was at, you know, we used to string together 12 sun worst stations in the basement of these companies, because it was before we had really sophisticated compute capabilities. And then I just kept following the tech into new areas. You know, it roll like Google just made sense, right, because they were at the frontier of building these scalable platforms that kind of proven at discover was my chops to turn around a credit card company using these principles, take it public out of Morgan Stanley. But I was in search for like some bigger platforms and I had some colleagues that had been long term friends of mine that were at Google have been trying to get me to go there since 2004. And so I decided, you know, to make the leap and be part of we were just desktop search at the time. Actually one of my early jobs was involved in launching one of the first Android phones and really building up that ecosystem. And it's hard to imagine that in 2009 that was new. And so we've come so far in this time period. And so each one of these had a theme around reimagining ecosystems. There's reimagining ecosystems. So there's this golden thread. You weren't reverse engineering this vision that, you know, you're going to become CEO of Monte Health decades later. You were following a thread, which was reimagining ecosystems. It sounds like it was also thinking about data driven decision making. Correct. And that just naturally led you to each of these. Yeah, think about being a translational executive in lots of different industries because at Google you could have fundamental tech, but you still had to translate that to help companies re-imagine how they did those things differently. So imagine if I've been at McKinsey doing that in all these different industries, I already knew those value chain economics. I actually knew a lot of those CEOs really well. And so helping people think about you can create all this great technology, but you also have to help it get adopted. And you have to think about how can the ecosystem make sense of it. And those choices become very, very important. That pattern recognition. And you know, this has been a thread for the last two ETL talks on what should you do out of college in terms of a job that you should pursue. And I'm just going to ask this because you do have such a deep McKinsey background. And a lot of the undergrads are wrestling with should I take a consulting job out of undergrad or should I jump into a startup or should I jump into a scaling stage company. What advice would you have for somebody who's wrestling with they have all those options. What should they pursue? You know, I think it's a very personal choice. I think in my generation, you know, consulting really offer this opportunity to work and build pattern recognition across a lot of different industries. And I think you can still do that there. At the same time, I think the way in which businesses are being changed and a lot of the marquee companies of this generation, you can also learn that within a Google or some of these other companies as well. In terms of working on a lot of different problems at the same time, I just think the most important thing you want to do early in your career is you want to see a lot of different business models. And you want to work with a lot of really smart people. So I would follow your passions and I would follow people. So, you know, when I waited around in those patty fields, I was following two really famous professors from Harvard and Stanford, you know, over there. And I was the bad carrier. And I learned more by being able to tag along to that. You know, I went to just run Discover Card because I knew the CEO of Morgan Stanley Phil Purcell and he took a risk on me to take me out of the firm and, you know, have me manage 5,000 people after that that was baptism by fire. But I had to learn. Right? And so in each case, I was going after. Right? Google was about, right, a vision for the future. And I think when you do that, if you work around really smart people, they will open paths for you to do many other things, you know, in your career. And, you know, that's my advice. That's great. I focus on people and bet on your own passion for learning and things will take care of themselves. I want to now click into this idea of how do you build deep tech mentors gang. I don't know if you understand how much of an anomaly flagship pioneering is history is littered with people that have tried to do it. Flagship has done and has failed. Okay. So it's really, really special gift that we have Margo here. I want to understand. I love this distinction between uncertainty and risk and swimming in uncertain waters because it's more important. It's more important to sort of not have for all the reasons that that that that conspired to your advantage when you are a sort of the only game in town. At the same time, there's a lot of companies that get started, especially out of Stanford, that are research projects that never actually take off. So if a student is thinking about actually, you know, giving their life to a new venture and you start up that is in uncertain waters. That's a big, area audacious vision. How do they qualify that to know that it's hairy enough to be uncertain, but still tenable enough to actually succeed and take off? Yeah, I think it's so situational to each and what an individual's risk tolerance is for the time. They're willing to put into something before they see it come to fruition. We get flagship, when we're launching a new company, we have a very simple framework. You and I talked about this the other day, which is, you know, why this, why now, why us? And it sounds so obvious, but it's actually not that easy to answer those questions, incredibly thoughtful. So when you say why this, why is the world better, five to ten years from now, because this exists, why is it transformationally better? Because by the way, most people forget that in rare circumstance does something become really big, right? You look at YouTube, Google, so it took ten years before these things were actually big. And so you have to really write the story of the future and convince people why is this fundamentally necessary? The second thing about why now is, you have to ask yourself, it's, it being too early is as good as being wrong, right? And there's a lot of things written on this. Why now, what are the fundamental things that are enabling this to be true now that could not have happened? And then why us? Why are we uniquely the team that should be able to succeed? Who else could be doing this? And why are we the ones? Why is this the combination of people, mindsets, capabilities to make it happen? And I think that's, that's how I think about it. And I wonder if we can just tactical on that, just so that we can make that real for the students. So, because even on the why now, it sounds like there's a sweet spot where you don't want something that is immediate, because it's sort of readily evident to a bunch of people in your have a lot of competition, but it also has to be within the strike zone where you can take off. So when you're looking at why now, how do you actually make that determination and, and how do you know if it's actually something that is within that, that sweet spot? Yeah, so I think the why now is what are the accelerators? Because whenever you're going after an idea, if you think about them also an investor, you know, what is fundamentally creating velocity? What's creating wind at your back? Like what is the new consumer behavior or the new trend? So, you know, when we, I'll give you a good example, when we came up with the concept of YouTube, we were really focused on replacing linear television. Because we said, why do people sit and watch TV by appointments? Why do they have to be stuck in front of all these ads? And, you know, Tivo was kind of around, but, you know, it wasn't that convenient, and you still were stuck with when people wanted, and there was limited content, right? There's a few guys and a few places that were deciding what's, who are are betraying, what kind of content we should watch. You had the huge adoption, right, of the web, of mobile, and all of a sudden we had the idea for people to be able to access content anywhere, anytime, and we were able to actually encourage that to flourish. And so, you know, I think you have to write the story of the future. Nobody should be watching linear television or content or ads, or shouldn't be a limited amount of content created. That just fundamentally makes sense. But if those other things were not true, if the internet was not developing, if processing speeds were not getting better, if you wouldn't be able to access it at any time anywhere, right, it wouldn't have been as easy to enable that to happen. But is there a certain suite in terms of the timing of the roadmap? If you could implement YouTube in the next month, would that have been something that you would have said, oh, that's too easily available? It has to take like 18 months or 36 months for you to actually get great. I don't think it's a time to get to an MVP. I think it's, how does it actually get better with scale? Like, if you think about all the really successful companies, there's a flywheel effect, there's a network effect, there's velocity, fundamentally enabling it to keep learning and get better. Otherwise, someone in an adjacency will just reverse in. That's what everybody missed about Netflix. They started just distributing all those cassettes everywhere, but they actually had a captive audience. So they were uniquely positioned to pivot and then invest into that business in a fundamentally new way, and the networks never saw it coming. So that's assessing if you have an opportunity, it's interesting. You want to see if at scale, do you actually create more value? Most companies at scale decreasing quality, you know, if you create something as a network effect, it actually increases in values that creates lock in. But even in the short term, then, like if I can, so Elon Musk, you know, famously wants to go to Mars with SpaceX. If we just use that as an example, but that vision of going to Mars might be 30 years away, you guys can correct me if I'm wrong. And so what he's done is he's sort of separated that out into these intermediary markets that he can unlock with intermediary products and thinking about, you know, these might be in like 18 month or 36. And with like, and he's done that with all these different platforms with Tesla. Now he's, you know, he's he had cars now he's opening up autonomous vehicle marketplace. Do you think about that as de risking or I guess what I'm that is fundamental to going after de attack, right? I think life sciences is no different, right? It takes 10 years to get a drug to market. So if I think about it in my own company, like how do I apply this in our own, we have this vision of how do we make small molecule drugs more predictable, but it'll take me a really long time. It's not really proven and to get all the way to the clinic. That takes a long time and a lot of capital. So just put it in perspective. It's similar to building these big tech platforms, call it rounded off a billion dollars and 10 years to get one drug, one drug through the clinic before you even make a dime. So you have to really think about how am I going to manage risk in that context and the way we do it is a couple of things, right? The first thing we do is we prove that we can scale this new type of chemistry that's more diverse and prove that it's valuable. We have to prove we can build AI that can interrogate it, but that AI can be used for other things, right? I can actually actually fill up the drug pipelines of partners. So what I did was for the first shots I took on goal, I use only clinically validated targets. So I know that I don't have to take biology risk. I just have to find a molecule that works. And if I do that even before I get to market a pharma partner, it's super interested in it. So they'll give me capital so that I can actually keep scaling the platform. So really how you break the problem down, just like Elon knows and going to Mars, he knows that we're under invested in our development. There's huge government funding. They need him to make these rockets and do these other things. There's real funding sources as he develops interim technology on the way there that he can tap into that can help fuel the development of the company in the future. That's why you can say I want to release linear television at YouTube, but you started just focusing on people watching a billion people watching as many minutes as possible. Then we figured out what content was really interesting to them, and then we stepped on the gas and attracting more of those content creators. And that was a very purposeful decision early on. Did we focus on minutes per session that totally changes how you build the technology versus as many people in as many parts of the world watching as much types of content and as many people creating content as possible completely change the arc of the investment of the company. And so you have to make those choices purposefully. So I think that is the most critical decision is early on. Your companies aren't going to die because you have bad ideas. They're going to die because you don't take off and deciding in that first phase. So assuming you have a big vision of what you want to go after, can we just dial into that first phase? How do you decide what to scope for what you're going to get done? And does that look differently than scoping out a project that's sort of a study state execution company? So I guess what I'm asking is there is a school of thought that you take the biggest risk and you de-risk that first. And that really venture capital is about taking the least amount of dollars to create the most de-risking. Is that the approach that you think about or do you think about it in a different way? And how do you decide the one metric that matters in that first phase? So I do think it's different for in different situations. I think if we just take deep tech and focus there, I do think people are looking for UDD risk the fundamental principles on which the technology is based. Sometimes it's one thing as I gave in the case of Montaille, it's multiple things. I have to prove that this chemistry can be aggregated at unprecedented scale and that I can use computation to curate it because only 1% of the molecules that we chronically consume are bioactive. So just because I could say I have a lot of them, no one's going to care if I can't find ones that are bioactive at scale. The second thing I have to prove is that this is not chemistry that drug companies are used to prosecuting. It looks a little scary. These are a lot of stereochemistry structures that are very different. They don't pass the LePinsky rule of 5. How do I prove to them that at this actually can be easily made into a drug and that you can actually make it cost effectively? I have to prove that. There are 3 or 4 things that I identified that I had to prove and I'm on a rapid path to say how do I get value creation proof that that's possible? I think that's how you manage in these deep tech environments. You go to your first principles and then you prove them systematically and you try to do it in an elegant way that it becomes stacking on the next one. I want to make sure that everybody gets it. You identify the drivers, the key drivers, the fund mill drivers. Are you thinking about the least risk that you can take to prove evidence against those drivers for the first phase? I think you try to take as much risk off the table as you can. You do. You're trying to maximize the de-riskiness. You maximize the learning to the ultimate outcome. In my case, I want to prove that I can efficiently turn this chemistry into a great drug efficiently. I can make it more predictable. What does that mean? I think we don't spend enough time breaking that down. I think that's what we're really, really good at flagship is we have rooms of people that will sit there and argue about that. We have the same thing at Google. I know we'll get to questions shortly. With a YouTube example, you have this vision. You know the world's changing. There should be a world in which YouTube takes over, which is the world that we're in today. But you have to decide early on what's the North Star metric. Can you walk us through how you made that decision for the first phase? Yes. We were a loved platform. We had a re-engineer because it fundamentally wasn't scalable. To be distributed everywhere, a lot of people don't remember that YouTube was a huge percent of the entire traffic of the internet. So, what are our biggest problems to solve was actually being able to get that thing to people and have it not just like glitch on you all the time. And you had to be able to do that where people had access to very different types of speeds of technology. So, there was that. And then we also had to get people to be willing to create for this thing. Because it was just a bunch of random guys. And that would only take you so far. We had to get like more different types of creators. So, we literally had to create studios and put people in front of cameras and you know to make it easier for more people to create better quality content. So, the North Star metric that led us to that was an obsessive argument about what would ultimately convince the world that this was the better way to go. And we took the reverse of what was obvious. If we could say a billion people were watching YouTube every day and billions of minutes, then people would have to say this is a thing. Like you couldn't deny that people actually wanted and that we had to redefine what people thought great content was. Because we realized as long as they thought it was a professionally produced right, our long segment with 20 minutes of ads, we were dead. Because that wasn't where people really wanted it and it didn't allow consumption anytime anywhere. So, we went back and forth and we said we're not going to think about programming. We're not going to think about individual experiences and how long we can keep them on. We are literally going to just focus on a billion people making this and as much diversity of content as humanly possible. Because we don't know what people really want. And then we can learn and reverse into what is getting people to come back the most often. What do they want more of? And we were actually would have been totally wrong if we were guest in the beginning. People loved those how-to videos. Like loved it. Like because they could go there and fix anything. People loved comedy. Like little skits and they loved like very simple things that were entertaining. They loved like the highlight reels, you know. And we could literally if you were watching and you could do it today. If you're watching the Super Bowl, like whatever is important on that, you can see it literally being searched for and watch on YouTube in like with 10 seconds. You know, it's really fascinating where you become a completely different way of thinking. So such a good example. So I just want to make sure everybody understands that. So you understood the drivers that were critical for this vision of YouTube. And then you said, it's a two-sided marketplace. There's viewers are three-sided, multi-sided. But the most important for that first phase, you can only focus on one. And you focused on, you said, if you had a billion views, everything else would be solved for. Or you could then get everything else. And so that was the objective function initially for the first phase. And then everything has to keep aligning to create velocity. So imagine when we were trying to create ads on YouTube, the user was the king, the user and the creator. And so we had to make ads that were skippable because if we didn't do that, right? It would violate your first. And so you have to make sure everything aligns. And I think that's something there's a concept actually I've talked about with a lot of entrepreneurs. Which is there's a difference between being a first mover and a first right mover. And I think we often don't actually interrogate that deeply enough. So think about Google. They were not the first search engine. They were not. Like I think there were four or five. Oh, no, they were way down the list, but they were the first ones who actually understood an ecosystem return where everybody wins. There was no friction. Right. They were not a portal. Portal fundamentally had decreasing value to the user. But if you actually with every single question that was being asked, I got smarter, I got faster, I got better. And I never bothered you was just a plain white screen. It was whatever you wanted. And it's still the same. That's the other thing people forgot. Look at almost all the major platforms, the fundamental mechanic of YouTube, Google, Facebook, right, Instagram. All the, they haven't changed very much Snapchat. That simple core idea and how it could be, right? Enhanced, get smarter and smarter and smarter. But as the user, you don't have to deal with that. It's all in the background. It just gets better in ways that make it more immersive and valuable to you. And that sense of people forget about that complexity kills speed. Probably the number one piece of advice I give to almost all the entrepreneurs I'm on the board of or invest in is you get that first version. It's really hard to get the MVP off the ground and to get to some minimal skill after that. Like the simplest possible one or two things that are deriving your entire momentum and let the rest go. And that because complexity kills speed. Complexity kills speed. That's so good. Margas on the board by the way of McDonald's, App Love and like every such a wide variety of companies. I want to open it up for questions gang. So please everybody raise your hands if you have questions. We're going to grab a few questions at first. So if you might have a question just raise your hand and then we'll try to get through as many questions as we can. Hello. Thank you for for your talk and the inside. So I'm an engineer, you know, so I've been my whole careers engineering and I'm an interesting bio just lately. And I find it very impressive. Also, I find a lot of questions and I also feel that is very simplified. Well, that's an outside of the point of view. What we understand is not as much is my feeling. Right. So how do you deal with this uncertainty when you build these companies? Because I just feel that it's really hard. You know, like 90% of the other companies. Well, the candidates fail. Right. So that kind of like tells you, you know, the rate of success and what's going on. So I just wanted to get your insight into. You know, there's a lot of widow and biology. And still we want to build solutions and how you deal with this high uncertainty as you said at the beginning right because we're literally blindfolded. So I just wanted to give it a little bit more of your insights behind the companies that are public or whether it's successful today. Yeah, I think that most people that outside look into this industry have no idea how tough it is. Like most of the major drug companies, Pfizer, Merck, Sanofi, BMS, Brissomire, Squib, you know, they're based on like five or six drugs period. Like that's what drives the vast majority of their revenue. And almost all the value in that industry accretes to the asset. That's what makes it so hard versus other industries to structurally amass the data because it's really hard to get paid for that fundamental generation of data driven insight the way, you know, think about Intel or Nvidia, right, the ships really do well in this industry. That has not been true historically in life sciences, all the value accretes to the asset that goes into the clinic. And so that has made it much more difficult to fund the stacking of knowledge plus knowledge is very siloed. So when you think about the ability to look at all the data that as you said on the web and build these large language models, you had a lot of places you could go to get that data. You have a lot of wall gardens, right, in the biology area and less incentive. It's a very artisanal process. That's also for me the reason I'm doing it because when we think about the problems that we solve in humanity that motivated me to do mountain turns out one of my kids has this really debilitating chronic disease to which there is no great solution. And I think there's no no better motivated entrepreneur than a mom on a mission. And for me, when I looked at this industry when I was working at, you know, an ancestry is that there has to be a better way, as you said, 10% odds at a billion dollars. Like just think about the value creation upside from thinking differently about how we approach this problem and use computation. But you are not wrong that we still do not know so much about human biology. And everyone in this room, we are very heterogeneous. There's not that much of differentiates or DNA. But how our bodies actually work, what we eat, the environment, right, all the other things around us that we're exposed to. And how they respond has a lot of intricacies that we're just beginning to untangle. And this is one of the reasons why we look at this as the biology century because we're now able for the first time to amass the fidelity of data at scale and be able to interrogate it so that we can actually start to untangle some of these mysteries for the first time. It would be wonderful if all I would love it, you know, as a tech person, right, if all the farmer companies in the world showed all the data from all their clinical trials and you were required to post that and share all the details from those trials, we would make a lot more progress faster. Unfortunately, that's not required. So in the meantime, we have to find other methods. And so you can imagine that's exactly how we came up with our hypothesis at Montaï. How do we start with chemistry that's already been chronically in the human body? We already know that these scaffolds can be tolerated on an ongoing basis if we're going to create a chronically dose medicine. I sure as heck would rather have something that I know and have already been in a person for a law often for a long time. But then I have to figure out how to why precision match those into biologic pathways. And that's where AI gets really interesting in understanding the chemistry and doing that precision matching. By the way, it's actually how drug development started in the 30s and 40s. We serendipitously discovered antibiotics and all these things, but it was serendipitous. What's awesome about AI is we can now make it predictable. So you have to take a really hairy problem like that and then try to find a way to break it down. And it's also why I only are pursuing clinically validated pathways in the beginning. We already know that there's for example a biologic medicine. Unfortunately, in chronic diseases take just inflammation autoimmune. We spend 165 million dollars, billion, excuse me, billion dollars, 65 billion of that goes on biologics that go to less than 10% of the patients. And yet we have 60% of our country that suffers the firm at least one of these chronic diseases. We got to we got to make pills, pill-based format so we can make these more affordable, accessible and help more people. That's what we're trying to do. And you have to like you got to break it down. You got to cut some of that complexity off. Next question. What are the advantages that can help a company clear out uncertainty in this field?

I'm finding these new innovative ways to treat drugs and I'm doing all this new chemistry and they'll be like, come back when you figured out a couple of these. There's a lot of good ideas that don't work just because there's so many things that have to go right that they run out of money before they can prove that. That really wants to get that question answered. Yes, right there. We need to pick it up for the mic for YouTube. We only have 30 seconds so if you can be concise it will be grateful. What's the biggest mistake you've made in your career? Good question. I think for almost all leaders I'll give myself two that I relentlessly focused on. The one is not making things simpler. I've gotten better at this over the year but I am relentlessly focused on simplicity and how do we actually take friction off the table and not make the goals too complicated? As I said, silos kill speed, complexity kill speed, and agility. I think the second is waiting too long on people. I think though it's the hardest thing as a leader is how do you make sure you have a team that works really well together and there's a lot of smart people but sometimes they just aren't great teammates. You've got to make those calls quickly because you can lose a lot of time if they're in a pivotal role. I would say those are the two big ones. That's great. On that, Margo, I have to cut and end this week's ETL. Let's give Margo a big round of applause. Next week we're going to be joined by Oli Goedze, the co-founder and CEO of Databricks. You can find this event in other future events in this ETL series on our Stanford E-Corner YouTube channel and even more videos, podcasts, and articles about entrepreneurship and innovation at Stanford E-Corner. That's ecorner.stanford.edu. Thank you, Margo. Thank you. The Odd Pernurial Thought Leader series is a Stanford E-Corner original production. To learn more, please visit us at ecorner.stanford.edu.
