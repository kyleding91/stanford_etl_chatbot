 This is the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series brought to you by Stanford Equal. Welcome everybody to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader seminar at Stanford University, which is a seminar for aspiring students, aspiring founders at Stanford. ETL, or the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader seminar, is presented by STVP, the Stanford Engineering Entrepreneurship Center, and basis the Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students. I am Ravi Belani, a lecturer in the Management Science and Engineering Department at Stanford, and the Director of Alchemist and Accelerator for Enterprise Startups. Today, I have the pleasure of welcoming Sharon Prince to ETL. We wanted to kick off the spring with a true catalyst for change, and we couldn't be more happy than to have Sharon kick off the spring quarter. Sharon Prince is the CEO and founder of Grace Farms Foundation, which is a new kind of boundary-defining public space in New Cannon, Connecticut, that has become widely known as a global humanitarian and cultural center. Grace Farms is the platform for the foundation and its interdisciplinary humanitarian mission to pursue peace through nature, arts, justice, community, faith, and design for freedom, a global new movement to eliminate forced labor from the building materials supply chain. Since opening Grace Farms has garnered numerous prestigious awards for contributions to architecture, environmental sustainability, and social good, including the AIA National 2017 Architecture Honor Award, and the Meas Crown Hall America Prize. Sharon also co-founded Grace Farms Foods, which offers coffees and teas that demonstrate what the foundation advocates for ethical and sustainable supply chains. And I think there may be some that you guys all are going to get the benefit, you can be the beneficiaries of tasting some, which is in the back of the room here, and for those that are in 178, you're going to get even some more privileged gifts. And 100% of the profits from Grace Farms Foods supports the design for freedom movement to eliminate forced labor from the building materials supply chain and the construction industry. In recognition of Sharon's impactful work, fast company has named her to its list of the most creative people in business 2022 for cleaning up construction and the AIA New York and Center for Architecture recognize her for the NYC, the New York City Visionary Award. Please join me everybody in welcoming Sharon Prince. Thank you. Thank you. Hello, it is such an honor to open your ETL series with you, Ravi, and all of your engineering and entrepreneurial students who are really thinking about how to create new things. And as you can think about architecture, which is inherently creating new things, what is so surprising, fascinating, and under-realized is the power, the enormous power of architecture to drive new outcomes, and even humanitarian outcomes. As a fellow entrepreneur, I think of architecture as a three-dimensional expression of a vision. And the other thing is that you think about architecture, space, and I do believe does communicate. So you start to wrestle with this idea of what does space communicate, and also embed values into space. Can you do that? Can it be generative over 100 years? Now, what can it do? Well, I'm going to share with you three creations that are all starting with a place. It is Grace Farms. This is Grace Farms. Like you said, situated on 80 acres when the first things was to preserve the land that was slated to be broken up. And then from this, you'll see the river building. It's a poorest building. It also tests the limits of engineering innovations, which I'll get into, but also creates proximities. And in terms of creating proximities, that includes people, sectors, and the whole concept to advance good in the world through nature, our justice, community, and faith actually worked on me. Because our investment in architecture to do justice and our commitment in terms of justice, really creating epiphany for me that initialized the design for freedom movement. And the other aspect is, like, again, now that you know, you can't unknow it. And I have to think about all the materials. Are we using when we bring them into sight now? Because like that epiphany happened after the whole concept was before we built Grace Farms. So those teas and coffees are the other avenue, with my co-founder, to demonstrate what we're advocating for. And that is ethical and sustainable supply chains. So now, I remember starting off as an entrepreneur, like you, I was in college. Just many years ago, is that the University of Tulsa, I was putting myself through school. And I was the graduate assistant in what was a new entrepreneurial study department. Dr. Hizrik was a rose scholar and was the foremost expert on entrepreneurism. He had just written a book on women entrepreneurs. I was like, wow, okay, gender parity. It's coming. We're right here. Not so much. This is almost more than 30 years ago, right? And this is what I've been working on too, gender and racial parity, being able to do that. So part of the concept that I employ in terms of being an entrepreneur, is being immersed. It's a little different than being passionate and obsessed, which, yes, probably like you, am that too. But immersion is necessarily present and active. And when you're immersed, you start to see the gaps in society that you might want to be able to address. You also see opportunities. And when you're immersed, you're also enveloped in a way that you're creating all the senses, right? You can start to see connections. So I found this is me at Stanford 30 years ago. This is the first time I met Stanford. And if you can see there, it is the 1994 World Cup is my first soccer match. So you can tell I'm really all in, even though it's my first soccer match. And I had 36 hours to get here. So I said, yes, you got to be present. You got to say yes and show up. I did that. And I happened to also be an outdoor inventor. So I love to drive fast and started, let's say, I think it's, so I started six years old. Water skiing, about seven or eight riding dirt bikes, and still have my motorcycle license. And this is Iceland back in 2003. So now, a decade later, in Iceland, I thought, oh, it's so exciting to be able to go full throttle on, and on a glacier, go full throttle on a snowmobile, at the same time you could dip into a hot spring. Well, at that time, I got there. I was like, oh, my gosh, this is like, I never saw, but mostly what you saw at that time was very boxy, North Face, no ads with women in it. And this is what I saw when I got to Iceland at that time. So cool, right? But what I also saw back here in the United States on the right is an advertisement that I literally just found, and I was wondering for this, the same magazine that when I did get the brand, I got the brand of 66-degree North, brought to United States. I got the North American Distribution Rights. And I just love this because introducing the winter collection, also known as a summer collection. And at that time, I brought it into United States. It was an urban outfitters, Paragon Sports, a little bit of fashion, also Paragon Sports being a very outdoor active place. And then what you see on the right is what I was dealing with, right? It is, let's see. If you get a, it has a bringing warmth to cold places, ex-girlfriends, not included. Okay, that's not exactly what I wanted to see. So you're trying to fill those gaps. And also when you're not familiar, you're scrappy. Of course you're scrappy. You got to figure, you have no budget. You have, you're fair on what to do. Well, when I brought the brand of United States, I just called up the Wall Street Journal. Did not have a PR firm called them up so I'm bringing this brand to United States. They did assign a reporter. The reporter came with me for four days. And I mean, fantastic, right? Well, not so much either. As you know, there's a polythera of challenges that you're going to face. In fact, I think there's probably an infinite amount. But what happens, what I, I think about it is that there's always going to be a challenge of the day. And then I look for the good news the day. It's literally been my practice for 17 years, just every single day. In this case, it was a bit of a more of a challenge than you might. That I thought, because it's really, really riding high on this idea that I was bringing the Wall Street Journal reporter, they sold out the company, I did not own the company. I got the North American distribution rise, did not own the company. They sold it out underneath me. I had the right of first refusal on my contract. And yet, I'm not Icelandic. So they sold it. Now I have a choice. There's a day before I'm literally getting on the plane. I have a choice to file a breach of contract, lawsuit, or make sure I get into the headquarters now. And bring the Wall Street Journal reporter with all that I invested in. So what happens, I got the report and I did do both. So now I'm in the next stage, just as to developing retail stores. And the architect, friend of mine, he was helping, helping us to develop these retail stores. I'm about to now roll out retail stores. And the Soho store went so well, it was actually profitable. Think about a pop-up store for three months, for a couple months, profitable, crazy, right? It had a dance party, basically, in the, in Soho, with Icelandic DJs, it was really fun. And okay, this is now 2007. The problem is I did not own the, the, the full, I'm not very glad to integrate, right? It also did not own the brand. Did not have a margin. The terrorists went up. Didn't have a margin. I mean, that, that, that was, that was not, that eliminated the possibility for me to stay in that company. So I divested. Good news the day is that Iceland, not good for the Iceland, but good for me divesting when I did is that Iceland bankrupt. How often does that happen? Okay, so I mean, I can tell you a thousand stories like those that are just crazy, right? But what I did adopt from that, and without 66 degree north, I would not have created great farms. There's no way because this concept of space communicates with derived from that. It's also about experiencing nature with the on wonder. There were so many aspects, including the owner's project manager that I hired, that was a colleague through this process too. And he was the one that had built, you can find built about didn't answer my calls originally, but then we start working together sort of like this pet project. And so now of course, his favorite. So the concept that I want you to really think about. Again, is that architecture space is a three dimensional expression of a vision. And it does, even if you're unconsciously doing so, it still expresses a vision. And we now have this opportunity to reimagine architecture as a driver of humanitarian outcomes and even to be this entrepreneurial platform. All right, so here's the first expression of grace farms. It is a really cool expression. In fact, it won an AIA New York Merit Award for unbuilt work. And yet my role as the entrepreneur is to mark to mark the vision and how it's being expressed. So I had a 35 page program that was highly aspirational and also utilitarian needs. So after two years of development, I had to ban the project because it did not achieve the goal. That's very, it's very tough to do. However, knowing that this has been a long term project went to a whole search to find the right architect now that I compared with. This is an image of Sejima in Isisawa of Sana in Japan. The reason why they are so perfect and it was a long process, another process just in terms of selecting them. But they were never tethered to existing models and what we're creating is a new kind of public place. There was not a place like this that was not only in terms of form, but in terms of concept. And so they could think in that abstract way. And you can see here too that when we were, it was an erudor process. So I am proposing concepts like we want to create an environment where you are experiencing nature, where nature is in the foreground and the buildings recedes. They took that further. You can see here that the building becomes part of the landscape. And also other things like we want to create a place of curiosity, new perspectives, create an individual experience and a collective experience. And it just goes on like a very peaceful respite and an active community, diametrically opposed. And there was many of those. So now here we are, it's a question, former question site. And now we start to develop, I'll show you a couple of the images that allow you to see that we, we certainly retained two of the barns. So in terms of reuse and remodeling, very effective in terms of design for freedom. Because you start to truncate the supply chain at the extractives, reducing the risk of exploitation. And it ends up being the only opaque spaces that we had, which were very advantageous as well. And then we are, Grace Farms is the only site in Connecticut that is both least certified for how we built and also how we operate. So demonstrating what ravic came for us all is in our mind. Okay, how do we, of course, have a site to have a garden speak and we could have the produce that we would also have on site. And also be able to donate and as a place. So here we are really again immersed in nature, the arts, all these aspects that I was describing. One is to experience nature. To encounter the arts and arts, meaning visual performing culinary and so forth. To pursue justice. This is Dr. McQuaggy, Nobel Peace Prize winner on the right and Nicholas Christoff on the left. And to foster community, this is actually the sanctuary at the top of the river that you can see has no stairs because it makes it become part of the landscape. Many aspects, it was the East cherished is individual design, the height of the stage is determined so that it becomes a more egalitarian space and that you get see into the into landscape. Foster community here is the comments, the center of the five glass and clothes volumes that you can see people now have to see with each other's option. There's a few others on the side and you can see these tables were made from wood that was spelled on site. That was part of the sustainable endeavor, but also it by doing so, it also reduces human exploitation because we know our supply chain using local, local fabricated materials in the United States and actually if you know where they are, even wherever you are, it's advantageous. And then in terms of being able to advance good in the world, explore faith because of your people all faith back rather than all, you can start to examine how can we do this together from a faith perspective. And this image I love because it shows you the hopeful space where we're meant to also in terms of the space being able to address pressing to humanitarian issues. So we wanted to create a light field space that had both spiritual potential and social potential. And you can see here there's many diviner interventions that happen on the way. So now the process, what is the process in terms of creating that you can apply to many of the of the creations you're involved in and will be. It starts with not knowing and also it starts with creating many, many options. So this is in their studio in Japan and what I love about this is that there was no, the answer was always we study, we will study not an answer that you would not a linear answer. And it was a really fun process to be going back and forth with them iteratively, but also they had got the same way of being in terms of being immersed. So after you selected the river building, it wasn't called the river building, it was actually the solution to a set of, you know, a set of requirements, the architecture directive. And it part of what we selected the river building, I thought, okay, it's done. And no, it was like literally many, many years all the way up to the finish line, but while you're still iterating back and forth. The, that image of the of Tashima is in Japan where they said, okay, now go out and see some of our other projects. I'm now placing 15 so that I can understand how they were interpreting that architecture again being immersed. So this is the interior, you see how it's situated on the hill, but the interior, this is a mind blowing project. One art installation, and this is just opening when I took that picture. And then some other elements, so you start to think about materiality. And this is really intentional. It's not a very clear. It's more of a blurred, reflective space, so that everyone has their own entryway, don't entree in. And then this is a really important part of selecting them is that I could see on the left that is this, as if you're walking out in nature. And you're also can be having this experience altogether that long bench I loved. And then on the right, the use of glass, super fascinating, but what I saw here is that the glass was green and did not quite love that. I select the clarity. And now the process. So this is a moment where I had to let a sedge my niches. I would know that the order of operations this we'd already been two years now into development about to go into construction documents. And as we're examining, I did not see a rendering for two years. So I really have encouraged something along those ways where you're not along the way where you're not tethered to existing materials that you're starting to hear you can see what we're doing is. I'm determined whether the proximities are right, the atmospheric elements, not not really concerned about whether that material sure comes later. But first are we is the order operations right are the. And at first, I thought what are we going to see the rendering and now I realize like that was elemental to producing the outcome. And then you'll see here too that there are many iterations that I can look at this as an art piece actually at grace farms that that helps you see that all the variations of all decision making along the way. But I did have to tell them that the order was out was not I not according was not achieving the goal because the tonality was intent to be both peaceful and active. But the way that the volumes ended up being positioned it was peaceful and I realized, okay, it's active peaceful active achieved many other goals that did not achieve that. So we had to switch those and that was a huge deal to do that if you your construction. No, no, so it's not it not a good thing had to reengineered the whole roof. It took about six months to make that change of just changing the order of the volumes. But again, you really need to know and be confident in your vision of what you're trying to create and you have to articulate what beforehand. You have to have to articulate the values you want to also embed the team members that you want on your, you're going to be a part of your team. And I think that's it was a really important way of being able to determine whether or not we were going to, okay, yeah, okay, this other one too. I want to show you is that this is where there's really a form of building like this where it again becomes probably a landscape, but this elevation change afforded many of those aspirational. This aspirational ideas just the elevation change so that you have these sight lines along the river. You're you're also even curious now if it's glass like what's happening here what's happening over there versus opacity and we I asked for an arbitrary experience because we're moving you're creating your creating new perspectives. Okay, so I had the the whole the whole now now we have the right order the projects ready to go about to go into construction and lo and behold another challenge this is there's many this is one of them. And this is a really want to create we we definitely value green energy we have 55 geothermal wells that power the river building. I just didn't want to see the landscape a cell tower 150 feet with a windmill on top. So about 10 lawyers from a top communications company is coming in to make this happen and there was state laws to proceed local and I had to go up against 10 of those lawyers myself so pay attention on your business law. Definitely do I use it all the time and what happened is that just prior that one rendering that one rendering did emerge and architect newspaper identified grace farms as an architectural gem. So I use that might offense because that was one of the really the sense there's a treasure property than those cell towers are not premier or have a way out. So you have to be you know always you're on deck is the point you're going to be on deck so be prepared and then you go into building so now prototyping right in architecture is one to one huge these models many models on site to turn whether this material is when you reflect the sky make the building be up for the landscape. And now the glass so we spent two years also in glass and the glass now I go over to shenzhen to take a look at the glass here we are we have over 200 individually curved in size glass panels that need to be clear in order to see the landscape and so when I'm there they're very excited this is it and I let it let them know that no it's not clear enough we're not going to go and see the landscape. We're going to go through all this and not have three last their response and they were the one of the best like Larry top glass folks and actually Michael raw is here from front at grace farms just a couple of weeks ago and disgusted again what's interesting is that we didn't create a new type of glass after that because that was pushing there that was a murder already the limits of what we could do in terms of creating the glass system in the northeast that would that would be able to withstand temperature and how to all the our factors that we need so we instead said you know in the Shazawa worked with everyone and created an altered the design so extended the roof and took off the laminate and so therefore with that simple solution right but I didn't realize until a week ago I forgot is that by removing the laminate you're not removing removing a contaminant and now that glass can be recycled. It's not recycled right now just you know so the flat glass right now is generally not recycled because those contaminants and instead not the recycling this but you can see like all these some of these are just pushing up again asking the questions about how to improve and also really to reach the goal. This is what typical millions look like the separators you can see that says a black one on top and did not want to see a black one I didn't want to see a black separator and a system there so we actually reduce the size of the spacer either double black this is an I do unit and reduce it by 55% so you see the gray below really want to clear but I had to compromise it gray. So we had like it was that they they commercially we could end up doing and make it warrantable and then we had these mock up so here's a large scale mock up and we're still testing and testing we did achieve the goal and here it is. So you can see all along the river okay in construction let's see I think this is it. Pick one quick sip all right so now we're in construction and I am super fascinated with the whole process I had never built anything by the way I also never had a retail store. I think you're in a great position because you're not tethered to any models or anything this is where you have so much promise you don't need the experience you need to actually know it's so valuable is knowing what you're trying to achieve. So in this case I was not invited to the construction site meetings it's an owner usually not and certainly not invited on the site I was there every week and I loved it I mean come on it's just look at that it is so super cold to see all the materials and even in our case they were voluminous and that actually informed design for freedom because now you're stood even though this building looks so light on the land it would have been a great deal. The volume of materials was mesmerized and it's quite a lot in this case I had just been to Sundance and it's like wait a minute we have arts how are you going to show any film in a in a glass building right so in the middle in situ we read how to take the footings out and created a space on the lower level. And always immersed I think a little too immersed here but I got my dog to my thighs but I love this image because now you see these are inverted egg crates that is a system that we brought in from from Europe is not really so hopefully it's going to be more a doctor because you're losing using less concrete and as you pour it over and then the air flow is acts like a radiant floor and air flows out to the perimeter grills. So what I see here too is we have cold rolled steel you have FSC certified wood FSC certified wood at that time did not include fair labor impus it does now but certainly reduces again the exposure to forced labor in the supply chain when there's more inspection of it. Now here's old school modeling we had to determine the height of the stage literally just for that just getting out our. You know you see in the background to there's just cut out some people making sure you can see but again determining that height of the stage. Okay I love I think even since I love I love walking on a roof so this was actually very informative because now I understood how the roof was being designed what you see is this beautiful you know beautiful roof but I was able to see how is even made by engaging right by being on the roof and then in this case that might it does look beautiful to achieve this is also excuse it. It went to the extremes because normally you have protrusions and a roof we even had to create a totem for the exhaust of the kitchen that was in the landscape really another whole section. So because you said you're on really nice is our as immersed and obsessed to ensure that we're reaching the goal. Underneath the flooring we I started to activate the space with the arts to warm it up so it's inherent in the whole atmosphere in the volume of it we had an artist come and we're just using nature arts and so forth also invited dancers. I don't think I don't know that again OSHA rules and all these other things I was applying here but how cool right so this is the court that last volume that didn't speak about it is a the glasses you can see is the perimeter at the top so it's light filled and it's submerged submerged into the landscape on the left also has the there so now is an art piece and both the Marcus Miller is on the right. He is a name that is a Harvard mathematician who was just starting embarking this 10 years ago 2004 on his during to be a decided to go into the saxophone player professionally right now he's playing with John Batiste and he's also our music director. So when you're creating something new our team are all entrepreneurial but there's never been a specific job that would align up typically right and so the potential of people to contribute was really in the arts and fun and we could also think about how we're going to create that team. And here we here's that at this point before we open not only inviting the arts to protect you know to be a part of the place also how to stake in the ground in terms of justice and that is to end modern day slavery. And we've had this point in the first year we had the UN University come also inviting a more multi sectoral group and we often had a report that went to the UN Security Council passed two three three one. And that so now what's happening so much there's like an all happening simultaneously so people have a chance to engage as they choose. That outcome I described in design for freedom this is at our summit just two weeks ago and we had 550 come just to be super clear this is not it this is undertaking you're taking on the entire construction sector and creating this radical paradigm shifts to remove for some child labor from the billionaire supply chain. And it takes you know it takes a whole industry to become a part of that and that's what we did the built environment does how relationship to nature and people. And the question that brought people around the table is is your building ethically sourced first labor free as well as sustainably designed as a question I asked end of 2017 beginning 2018 to get people on board and the answer is we don't know. If you look around here you don't know what these materials are made from. Yeah there's unlike even clothing you know the provenance might not know who we know I know the origin and I piece of clothing but you don't know and these are materials that are highly fraught so. The one thing to know is that with construction you think about labor but it's mainly on the job site was spend the whole sectors been given a labor transparency pass. So the construction is the largest industry that is at that has the largest industrialized industry at risk of forcing child labor it's also the most agrees violator of carbon emissions at 37% and they do go together talk about that other time that why that relationship might be studying that. So the use of the industry nearly 14 trillion in consumer spending and spending globally and at their new numbers that just came out of estimates of the elicit profits that are being earned by subsidizing with forced labor 200 and 36 billion of which that's on modern slavery of which 63 are derived 63 billion dollars derived from forced labor. So at that time there was no list of materials and this is literally only five six years ago right five 2018 at the beginning no list of the materials so we issued that and I also explain how that happened because we started to before I do the most important thing is people not the numbers is we have there's 28 million people in forced labor conditions around the world estimated likely more. And it's been escalating the last estimate that was revealed was 25 million a few years ago five years ago and it's escalating it's not decreasing even with more knowledge right about supply chains and forced labor. Here's that list of materials that that really some of them have long standing histories of forced labor rubber you might be studying these in different ways but rubber glass fiber textiles steel electronics bricks think about right crazy timber and copper stone. So you read all of us to them iron minerals and polysilicon. Okay that's these are at risk materials and you are not we're not expecting our supply chain. Now solar panels saw pillow polysilicon is fraught and is definitely is solar panels are not sustainable for subsidized the forced labor and maybe that. So I know you're working on projects that okay this is a very important concept because 35 to 45% of all the polysilicon in the world is being sourced from the week of region of China but that's not the only at risk material you have steel copper aluminum glass glass also when I describe that you for there are no third party audit certifications for glass that include fair labor there are for many others that we put in our toolkit. So now we also see some low hanging fruit right there's been I said first food is called the accountable then clothing next to shelter clothing is already been accountable and there are certain transparency. You know certifications that have been put into play there's more there's there's more transparency in that sector so now we're looking to take that sector and that accountability and convert that into interiors so. They you know curtains chairs carpet right just the textiles alone from that from the garment industry we can convert and we're doing that. There also now this question that I got quite often is like I've already and you might be thinking it's just like I've heard there's so like lead certification I'm not going to just lead but in. So being sustainable takes a lot of effort and it actually cost more quite often and so people asked me is this going to cost more yeah it's going to cost more now that I have to you know now go this process to be ethically sourced and in my head i'm thinking that is crazy because you know i'm not going to accept subsidizing our ROI is a slavery so that's why I was saying I was saying look we're subsidizing our ROI is a slavery. And the response was okay now what you're developing so in terms of trying to like explain how to create movement in this case it's also crazy to sink language that can help to be adopted more broadly so instead to convert that thinking and says it can cost more are we willing to accept the slavery discount. I'm not willing to do that so I want to show you the keep actor here we say challenging really fair market value fair market value is not fair and it's not the current price if it's subsidized with forced labor another way think about it is that if the fair market value with fair labor is here and the market price that's it's really fair market price up here with fair with fair labor. And the market but the market price is here without inspection you don't know it may or may not that delta is the slavery discount. So that's a term that is starting to be adopted I propose that about more broadly a year ago and now the good news of movement starting to be adopted. And another thing about billion movement okay high from the very get go the urgency of the situation really it made me think about having the full ecosystem to really come together right it's not just one sector that's responsible so these you'll see in the in blue it might be little type of political well you can see it yeah. These are pressure points that you do have agency so whether it be owners and developers as an owner's project requirement you could set you could say you can't actually right now have a fully ethical supply chain without forced labor but you can determine a subset and you have media is important in terms of awareness government agencies on contracts and extractives and manufacturers obviously documenting as a university being able to do that. So the university being able to initialize research which I'll tell you about is happening at Stanford right now and then the public demand right that's a very important part of the equation. Green people on the table and the idea from the get go is that we need CEOs and and industry leaders to be a part of the working group because you want them to make immediate decisions and how do you that happen you ask them. Everything that most everything it sounds like you have the correct connections now I asked those who built grace farms and then I asked them to say who else do you know let's ask them and we're going to have gender parity on this in looking at it also in terms of gender racial parity trying to include make sure that's part of our concepts of how we want to create that team and did so and then and then the next part that's really important to is to have you as the university students I'm really this is a gift to be here. Because the you as university students are able to imagine the future but like I said without being tethered and we're now they've been engaged with probably 25 universities and I think it's a very important part of being able to get for you to carry the the baton. So our first industry report we formally launched the movement 2020 and those working group members 30 them were part of that our private you can see it in the in the report and then people ask okay just tell me the just tell me which one of those materials are made without forced labor well we're at the beginning of movement we need the transparency so we did start so you have to use a toolkit it's not going to be a certification out there already we have to create it we have to start to. We developed a toolkit for the industry to start using and they are and then our creative director Tessie that's our set is one of the co authors on the report along with the foreign ambassador among slavery to say okay what we're going to do next again asking the questions what's next so can we now we need to have pilot projects so here they are they're in locations on three different continents this is in three years time three continents and that means you have to get the whole team like an owner this is a. Architect engineer construction has to agree to do this and and so we had pre-contents 12 projects and one really beautiful project that aligns is shadow of a face with Nina cook john which is a very time and monument that replaced Christopher Columbus monument see that shadow of faces it's really extraordinary. And black chapel again limited materials in London at the beginning and then we had a full scale project in the can library turn construction on this project and you see how now they have adopted design for freedom and are committed as well as mill or null a top firm to and then the bridge in India this is now a bigger project a million square feet and it's with one of the large and one of the key industrialist there is the new mjall in India where there is a. The highest number of those enslaved conditions so it's pretty bold to do that too. And then our teams now starting to get our fees for new projects one of them that we just announced we know five new ones last week at the summit and car carcass institute democracy for the university of Virginia is on board you can imagine that capacity we're going to have to accelerate the movement and design for freedom ethical supply chain workshop turn construction and. State Department oboe said you've got to bring suppliers to the table and I said you're the one who's all suppliers so let's co host a working group which we did just November and have a report now that we also published last month. Now this is the main cost of I hope that you'll carry with you along with the slave discount is that we need to ethically decarbonize right at a point in time now where we're already my opically focused on let's say on materials in terms of of embodied carbon and what we've left out of the equation is embodied suffering and so this is the time now this next step I point we coined the term anodisone from the Yale Center for ecosystems and architecture. And I coined this term and that was just in September and now the press is already picking it up and we're starting to have that mindful because it's important because as we're decarbonizing we have to determine who is making these materials. So we are accelerating the movement through the summit that just happened 550 came part to tell you because we had 75 students from 30 universities and on the left is your cerebellumton who is the. Chair of the civil and environmental engineering department here and I don't know if Antonio's here but the Antonio so great he is a PhD student who has now initialized the design for freedom research project this is not cool this is to trace and understand the provenance of concrete don't know if this has ever been done anywhere else it just right this is incredible and then the middle is students from Pratt and they. They are the architecture students with a Kai Ua Bergman who I also just invited to be part of the working group he's they operate in 40 countries and they it's pretty exceptional but what they said the students said this last week couple of weeks ago is just that it's the wisest part of our curriculum. And what you know that Sarah is already hoping to make that happen here at Stanford and on the right is Princeton students with our structural engineer net often hanger. This is happening today which is this is one of the panels that we had it was called navigating to yes with the ACE team and legal and on the left next to me is Sarah is a Leslie King she's a killer construction lawyer. The work is urban every years and then then part of the working group to think that's so important about this now is how can we get into contracts so on today's loop with all of us so I'll have to talk up to chime in when I when I'm done with this but we're trying to wrestle with the dilemma that persists between being compliant with existing laws there are now laws they're going to that but there's laws that are now making us accountable and the capacity to be in compliance. It's big dilemma right but now we have great minds on it and we're counting together we also now want to initialize a public demand and so with every fiber is a exhibit that we're opening next month and it does include me to cook John again and in the middle of from Pentegrin we're working with Eddie for 12 years and an adi so from Yale. This is the exhibit and not only are we going to create an understanding of the materials that are fraught but there's a bio wall there that is really going to be extraordinary you'll see that when you come hopefully but we're going to do it shows the future right of materials. And then lastly our our Grace Farms teas and coffees which I hope you get a chance to taste but it's important we're demonstrating we're advocating for B Corp and it is a new structure that is wholly owned by the foundation that gives back 100% to design for freedom. So this is again an entry point for the public to engage and even learn about design for free and you'll see that logo on the back. And this is in Darjeeling which is considered a Darjeeling tea the Champagne tea again immersed and so I just really really invite you to be able to think about the agency you have to create a more human future and also note that we all do have agency to design for freedom. That's it. That was that was so so so terrific. We I know we're coming up on we were almost at the end of the of the allotted time and so if there are any burner questions please raise your hand. Otherwise I may just take the liberty of asking a question myself which is you know I think one of the biggest gifts here in this class is that the students get to feel the agents of change you know first hand. And I think one thing that's so self evident I think everybody can feel this is the the buoyant confidence that you have you know this is a narrative of like all entrepreneurial journeys of challenges. But I'm curious is that confidence something that you cultivate are there practices that you do that you that you treasure now that you wish you knew of when you began or were you just born with this this effervescent energy to overcome challenges. I I really believe that is the micro every day stands that you take and I do that all the time I mean I do that. It's just every week I like examples of like okay bank account puts the male's name first instead of the female me my husband's on my it's like no it's made me first not him and I have literally right on the checks I I just like this little micro aggressions you know that people that I think are improper like this not how it should be. So that's just one example of a thousand but it's just inside I just every it's a practice and I just do it all all really almost every day it seems like there's like a correct it like you're trying to help see in a positive way okay now. Here this is there's a better way forward with even small acts just getting energized for taking action on small acts and then I also notice that you're saying that every day you're you're conscious about what was good that day. Yes yes that's super important now because you'll not you will not and actually there are we looking for. I mean looking for the good news a day which does happen you have to look for it doesn't it's sometimes not obvious so I literally say okay and the good news of the day is and the good news so you're saying that to yourself and I say it out loud you say it out loud to yourself no no I say to ever you know so okay so now I literally do so and the good news of the day is X you know and why well the good news for us today is that we had you share and kick off ETL so thank you I have to draw it to a close because we're out of time but thank you all for joining us for the kick off next week we're going to have because our units is the CEO of applied intuition joining us and you can find this talk and others on our YouTube channel the e-corner YouTube channel and more materials you can find at e-corner.stanford.edu so thank you all for joining thank you for having me.
