 Who you are defines how you build. This is the Auditorial Thought Leader's series. Brought to you by Stanford E Corner. On this episode, we're joined by Sam Yam, co-founder and CTO of Patreon. In 2013, Sam teamed up with his college roommate, Jack Conte, to create a platform that connects content creators with members who provide recurring revenue. Seven years later, Patreon has funded more than 100,000 musicians, artists and other creators to the tune of $1 billion. Here's Sam. Tech is getting an increasingly bad rap, sometimes with regards to its influence on society. And I think it's already well sort of widely understood that startups are difficult in their own right to do. They can be really stressful. They can be just requiring a lot of effort. The thought was to go through my personal experiences and think through what makes it worth it to go through the process and how you get through the mentality of doing startups in this sort of environment. And I decided on the title that everything is worse than you think. And I figured a great place to start is just a run through of my own life in highly curated Instagram story fashion through my experiences this past holiday in Bali. So here we go. I don't know if that is true. Okay, cool. So I think that's pretty cool. It seems like I might be hashtag living my best life. But the reality of this whole trip actually was that I was quite miserable. And in this time of the age, it's not surprising that what you see on Instagram stories isn't represented necessarily of reality. And maybe we're just filling out a bunch of fake news everywhere. But like the truth of what I was experiencing through this trip was very early on, I ended up with food poisoning. And then right after that, when I was chasing waterfalls, as you saw, I got a cut when I slipped on some rocks and then I got infected. And I don't know if it was related to that. But like right afterwards, I got severely ill with either some flu or virus or disease and it just put me out the rest of the trip. And so it turns out my most memorable sort of experience through this whole trip was none of these clips. And this is seared in my mind actually, this experience. It was actually when early on, I was on a car ride trip which was about two hours back to the villa where the group of us were staying. And I remember I was already not feeling well at the beginning of this trip. So all day I'd been drinking mainly these tropical jungle juices and tonics. And then about 10 minutes into this journey, I just threw up everything in my stomach, right in front of me in the car. And I so distinctly remember in between the heaves, I was just crying. And I had my friend beside me and the driver. And we just, we had to all get back to this destination still two hours away because that's where we all were. And I just remember sitting there in the pool, my own vomit, questioning my life decisions and just realizing that we still had to go the rest of the way through this two hours. And that was how I kicked off my trip to Bali. And I just remember through the rest of my journey, I was just, as I mentioned before, miserable. I, there's a lot of mosquitoes in Bali, that's fine, you know, it's like nature. When I got, in fact, the infection, I wasn't sure whether it was because after I got cut in the waterfall, there was like a local lady who cut my bandage with this personal siph that she just happened to have at hand or whether it was like the dirty waterfall water. But I never figured that out. It didn't really matter to top it all off. I got to just sort of freak out over this rat I discovered in my room that here I just wanted to show this. Oh, he's coming, he's coming for me. No, he's running back, but he can't escape. How did he get in here? Oh, he can't escape. Where's he going to go? I've cornered him and he knows it. Oh, God. Okay. So I'm just deliriously talking to myself, really, obviously, non-control of the situation. And why am I sharing all this? So the point of all these experiences is it turns out that's sort of what startups are like. It's like sitting in a pool of your own vomit as you're like dying of an infection and then being trapped in a room of like insects and rats. So that's why the way I wanted to sort of start off this talk was just giving you a quick sense of my perspective of things and then maybe where I can actually begin is just sort of whirlwind tour of my own background. So yeah, I was born Iowa City. My parents were immigrants from Hong Kong and so that's me and my sister. I was born there, but I actually grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I remember actually much of my childhood was centered around, I did a lot of studies in piano, Carnegie Mellon. And my college essay was about how as a child, I was really curious and stuck my hand in the door hinge, my mom just slammed it. So I actually, she chopped off the tip of my middle finger and there's a set of images where I was just in like a full handcast as a child. But then my essay was about how I persevered through that, ended up studying a lot of piano and then before I graduated high school actually performed that Carnegie Hall over in New York. And that was really exciting to me, except what I realized afterwards is that in order to have a career in something that you're passionate about in the arts, you have to be the best at it. At least this was in my mind at the time. Or otherwise, there weren't really too many paths to success there. And so instead, I decided that the much more rational approach was to study computer science, join startups and then end up building a company where then other artists and creators could then find a means to build out a career around their passion and their craft. But I'm jumping a little bit ahead. I want to go back on campus. I actually, the thing I remember having a lot of fun with was I actually delivered in an out burgers. And so this was before DoorDash and all the stuff, I don't know what you folks used nowadays. But this is an article from 2006 in the Stanford Daily, which sort of dates me. But basically talking about how I created a website. People on campus were ordering in an out burgers and then I would come through in my Honda and just hand deliver burgers. So a lot of hustle. After I graduated, I worked at two startups that you probably haven't heard of. One was called Named the Other Called Looped. You may have heard of the people that started these companies. Mark and Jason started Named. He now runs the VC firm in recent Horowitz and he was also found in Netscape. And then Looped at the time, Sam Altman had dropped out of Stanford. He later went on to run Y-Common Air and now he's currently running OpenAI. And so as a quick aside, one of the things I've certainly found out about Silicon Valley is that the network is quite small and you end up running into the same people over and over again in the industry. And because of that, it's really important to foster great relationships. I mean, A, because it's just a good human thing to do. But then also, because you never really know where everyone's going to go in their career and what they're going to develop. Going back to the case of Mark and Sam, Mark ended up writing my recommendation for the Co-Term program over here at Stanford. So that was really helpful. And then Sam has been really instrumental in my career, both as an investor in companies that I've done, but then also in helping me out get a role in Y-Common Air when he was running it. So I think it's just really important to care deeply about the community around you and the people that both you can help support and then they can help support you. Okay, then I started a company you definitely haven't heard about called AdWorld. Still recovering from the Bali stuff. And that was acquired by a company called AdMob and then they in turn were acquired by Google. So I went through that whole process, came back afterwards to here at Stanford and the Startex, great program run by great people actually. And still being run now, where I was an entrepreneur residence worked on a few companies here. And then reconnected with my, as we noted earlier, my freshman year roommate, Jack. Started the company Patreon Patreon. I imagine the authors not familiar with us. It's actually quite a cool company. This is a man of polymer. She's a sort of kickass musician. We help sort of creatives artists get direct funding and financing from their community. And so these artists can ultimately build a career, focus on what they're passionate about. And in return, the community gets access to the artist. They get to develop a connection with a sense of intimacy or they get access to exclusive behind the scenes content and learn more about the artist. Okay, I want to get back to the original topic. So the way I think about talks is primarily through stories. And so I went through my whole past experiences and I realized that the struggles and hardships I went through sort of centered around these three themes. And that's really what I'm going to talk about today. And either they were personally experienced or something I witnessed. And so the structure is I'm going to talk about the three themes of hardships that I've gone through. And then sort of on a broader level, talk about some thoughts on maybe how you can approach and deal with them when you go through these yourself. Okay, so nobody cares about your problem. This actually I think is surprising to most people. In some sense, I think people expect that they have to sell them. There's a lot of common knowledge out there around how you want to find your first users be really passionate about your problem. But it turns out even if at least this is what I've experienced across a few startups. Even if you have strong conviction, the early users always seem to, they always seem to, at the point of closing, not maybe initial discussions, not come on board. And I found this out sort of over and over again. The example with AdWRL initially was that we had what we believed was a really compelling solution to a problem about mobile ads at that time, where you couldn't change out to different mobile ad networks without submitting a whole new app into the App Store. And so for us, we realized that we were making, we were using this in our own apps and we were making thousands more dollars in advertising revenue and we figured other companies would be making tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands more. And it just seemed like a no-brainer. And so we actually went through the entire App Store rankings list, contacted all the developers and we didn't get a single reply back in email. And it just looked like, despite it being obvious that you would make more money, nobody really cared. Same thing happened with Patreon surprisingly too. So Jack had a great network of artists and creators that he knew. And then we collectively put together a list of maybe like a hundred folks that we felt could really benefit from sort of launching with us and that we would line up some press and they could sort of ride that as they were launching out with their audience. And so we went through that list, contacted all these different YouTubers, creators, and also nobody launched with us. And so I remember like one of the emails that Jack ended up showing me was from one of sort of the aggregators who was like also pitching this idea to folks. And you know the language that this person used was can't say that the interest level of sky high will keep pushing and nothing came out of it. And so when we launched Patreon it was just Jack, his roommate at the time and then his now wife Natalie. And that's all we had. So it was the only people that were willing to give us a shot on this. And obviously I think things worked out. But and I'll address some of that later. But I think it's very common that until you can actually show an example of success and drive those initial users, people aren't very interested. In the case of AdWro it wasn't until we started sort of publishing some of our own numbers about how much money we were making onto external news sources that people found that we had some legitimacy. Okay, I find this to be an interesting problem too. That your plan just ends up being wrong all the time. And the example I used from Patreon is that we were really sure that the way that would make us unique as a platform is that we would allow artists because we believed that new influencers nowadays weren't sort of locked into this album release cycle. And so they would release content whenever it made sense for them. So we were convinced and had really strong conviction that what needed to exist on this platform is the ability to only charge when you released a new song, a new album, a new piece of art. And so that was the crux of our value proposition with Patreon. And it turns out after we launched, even though that's how we launched, artists cared much more about a stable revenue stream where they would have consistent money coming every month and so they could actually think about planning for their finances in a career, which makes a lot of sense. This sort of situation, I find, yeah, eventually we had like 95% of artists just doing sort of a monthly payment plan instead of a per song or per work. And I found in just talking to a lot of different folks that this seems to always happen too. So I was back in, I don't know what this was, 2010 I guess, working at this incubator called Dog Patch Labs. And this was the same incubator where across the table, both Kevin Sishnam, who I think is going to be doing the last talk in this series, was working and building out Instagram, but actually at the time, still using all the bourbon branding and stuff because that was the first company that they had been working on. And so I remember I was like, curious about all the other groups working around me. So I got set up on Instagram with Mike, Kevin's co-founder and then I asked Kevin, like, what are you, I'm curious, what's your plan, what are you thinking about with this company? And at the time, and this was I think as they were pivoting out of bourbon, what he described was, A, Instagram is just going to be easier to use than all the other photo services. But their strategy was that it would be the first pillar as part of a lifestyle suite of apps. That could encompass different things. And so this one was about sharing images of your life. They could have a location oriented one down the road. And it turns out that Instagram was compelling enough where none of that other planning had to materialize at all for them and then they went on from there. Something happened with a little similar thing where early on I had met Ben Silverman who was the founder of Pinterest. And we were doing a few strategy sessions because this was before he had launched Pinterest on just things that we were building. We were both trying to come up with startup things at that time. The original demo that he showed me that prior to Pinterest was actually a mobile app that allowed you to sort of group different fashion together and then eventually like purchase different clothes and things like that. And so Ben is an amazing strategic thinker based on the experience of my conversations with him in the past. The point of all this is like I think you just get going. You allow every single time that you're proven wrong on the planning that you have laid out. You're almost guaranteed to run into this. And so if you can develop the mentality that it's not a big deal and that you have conviction on some core principle of what you're working on, it's okay for your plan to be absolutely wrong. Also in these cases that I think the folks found success afterwards but even in the case where you have to pivot or do something different, I think just being comfortable with the fact that more likely than not you can't anticipate like the mentality of groups of people is what everyone ends up facing regardless of how successful they are down the road. Okay. This one is more personal to me and I think it has a lot to do and maybe folks here share this mentality with both like a desire to optimize the things that you do with your life. And then also this idea that you want to be questioning all the time if you're making the right choices and have the things that you've done been working out. And so for me particular because I do a lot of questioning about everything that I faced with continuously, I find myself oftentimes in this maybe like toxic cycle of thinking through the choices that should have been in the worst case getting to regret about it. And so just highlighting a few examples of this in my own life. Maybe on in AdWorls that was the first company I found it, life. We got an offer from this company named Quatcha Wireless and so both me and my co-founder were really young at the time. We didn't know what to make of all this and I remember when we asked our investors for sort of advice they gave us some opinion that basically led us to going okay we're not going to do this acquisition. Then afterwards we saw quickly that Apple acquired Quattro and then Apple appreciated itself and the deal ended up valuing us around 150 million but we never took that. And that was at that time myself being like 25 years old something that I really was fixated on for a really long time as in like how could I have made a better decision here or how could I have had a better thought process around this. And then it sort of happened again I don't know if you folks have heard of this company named Fab but on the next company when I was working at Stardex that I started this is sort of silly but this Fab was also interested in acquiring us and so I remember reaching out to a few folks and asking for advice here again and especially in the context of what happened before thinking that maybe wanted to go through this sort of acquisition but then ultimately decided not to and then shortly afterwards we sort of couldn't escape the news where it just seemed like Fab was taking off and the reason they were interested in us is because we had helped them set up with group buying through our platform at that time but yeah like my co-founders and I were just sort of sitting there not freaking out but just thinking that we were bad at making choices and ultimately I also remember like seeing all these articles because this happened very shortly after we stopped working on that original platform and then I reconnected with Jack and we had launched Patreon at this time and looking at also whether it made sense to go back and possibly talk to Fab early on because we weren't getting a lot of traction in terms of people being interested in Patreon at the beginning and it was doubly true because the day that Jack came to me and I had that date marked because the day that Jack came to me I was also working on another idea for like freelance photography and the tech-crunch article for that had just come out. So when I originally had met Jack we met at this place called Coffee Bar in San Francisco. I thought we were just going to talk about an idea that he had so that could give him some advice and I remember he came to me at coffee bar and he's like okay Sam I don't know what the process is for this do I have to get a couple of like non-disclosures and can we sign a few documents so that you don't steal my idea and I remember telling Jack look ideas don't matter at all like you can tell me you can not it doesn't really matter to me. I'm happy to offer my thoughts if you want to share about what you're doing but otherwise you know it's great to catch up it's very cool seeing you on YouTube these days and he ended up sharing me the idea around how he's thought all his artists and friends had huge influence but weren't making money at all on YouTube and then the me and next thing I told him was Jack don't tell anyone else this idea I'm going to start working on this now and I began coding that night and I was just both of us were just convinced that there was something here and it was a personal sort of problem both for Jack obviously as an artist and creator but then also for myself just having gone through my own experiences and fortunately for us Fab totally just fell in and sank so I didn't regret it later on okay so how do you think about approaching these problems when you're dealing with them and you know I have this mentality that I'm sort of going to indulge myself here but Jack made a video my co-founder about Patreon a few years ago and it's a little bit it's a little bit gross but it also I think is like highlights the point that I'm sure there's a thing that creators do when you get obsessed with a thing and you just keep grinding on it and you work so hard and you don't sleep and you just kill yourself to turn a vision into a reality and Sam is my co-founder this video isn't supposed to be about him but every time I think about that first year of Patreon it becomes about Sam because Sam would code in bed and he would like fall asleep for an hour and then he'd wake up and then he'd keep coding and he'd fall asleep and wake up and he'd keep coding he was the only engineer and we're servicing you know thousands and thousands of accounts and only Sam and his room was disgusting because he just he was around the clock working so hard look at this fucking mess on his desk it's unbelievable he would I mean he hates when I show these photos but I just have to because it's this this is the these photos are the embodiment of what it means to take a thing in your head and to make it real and put it in the world it's creation it's the making of a thing it's the turning of something into a reality I'm so grateful to Sam he has a work ethic on like anyone else I know this is my favorite photo as Sam this is how I remember Sam the first uh makes the honestly I get emotional looking at this photo thinking about this it um he gave himself fully to Patreon to to our mission to what we're doing and uh okay so before I totally turn on the water works on camera here okay so the the thing obviously aside from finding a you know it helps to find a co-founder where you both love each other dearly is I want to justify what what's actually going on here so it it looks like a carnivix which it is but it's not because I was like eating eggs on my desk because there's obviously no place to cook them so I think I was using it sort of poorly as like the overfill trash and uh it didn't it just it didn't work out um but uh the the point more here that I'm trying to make um is to find the thing uh that you can be obsessive about to the point and and this this is obviously the wrong like this is unhealthy but like to the point where the other things uh get phased out in your mind and they don't matter right um and so when you're dealing with things like regretting other decisions that you made or uh that your plan isn't working out or that just nobody cares about what you're doing um if you yourself are convicted and you feel that you care deeply about your and it's the only thing you can focus on then uh uh also your personal hygiene but but beyond that like you can get through most of the issues which doesn't guarantee success but at least you know that you're working on something that you uh that you feel is worthy of your time and so uh I find that this notion of like phasing everything out and just being like laser focus on the thing that you care about is is actually quite uh uh sort of almost ubiquitous uh like there's uh this language is used very consistently among uh other successful companies so like Patrick callison of Stripe has this tweet where he describes um creating Stripe required obsessive intensity and then he notes that um maybe better founders could have worked you know smarter um instead of harder but but at least for Stripe they just had to work that hard and I like Paul Graham who started Y-combinaries response to this too that effectively the the implication is that in every case starves just require and uh an immense amount of intensity um he describes it as the way Patrick what he means that by better founders is that it's it's an empty set of folks and that just everyone is going to need to work that hard um and I actually found the the best example uh or at least the example that resonated the most with me here um came up during a discussion with um uh a friend of mine on on on this uh Bali trip too and uh it had to do with um uh this friend of mine worked at a uh a hedge fund called uh Bridgewater Associates and um it's it's the number one largest hedge fund in the world but it's also uh really famous for the founder Raidalia who has this book called Principles just instilling this uh uniquely intense culture which most likely isn't for every company but um a few tenants of of that culture are primarily around this notion of uh extreme transparency and candidness um in feedback to to improve everyone within the organization and so uh meetings where you have like three people discuss uh a topic are recorded broadcast out to the rest of the organization and then in real time people provide feedback um and criticize you on points that you make and so uh you you get to see this sort matrix of feedback continuously on your performance at uh at all times within this organization and so uh uh the founder Raidalia um uh is uh he he condensed a lot of these principles and then wrote out this book which became like a number one New York Times bestseller a few years ago but the the story that my friend shared uh when he was working at Bridgewater Associates uh came from recently where um he was noting that uh Raidalia was uh in a meeting room and he was uh he was really upset that uh the whiteboard happened to be in his mind a few inches positioned uh too low and uh it became such a systematic failure of how this decision was made in the organization that he started asking around and just driving up and seeing how this decision was made and the understanding was actually eventually through this process a group of folks were actually let go from the organization and um it we debated this uh me and my friend for a bit uh to say like what is this a good thing to like be focused on something ultimately and and maybe both our minds was was quite trivial um and uh uh like and also why right like Raidalia is uh he's 70 years old he's many times over like a billionaire like just just chill out and go relax and enjoy the rest of your life why be so fixated on uh this just this meaningless point um and beyond that too uh uh uh my friend was telling me how uh he would read every single like new associates papers in the company and uh if it was not up to par he would chew that person out in front of the the whole company and organization and so um we debated this for a little while and uh where we landed on that I think at least this this concept connected with me uh for why why this matters at all to Raid still given where he is in life um is that in his mind like bridge water associates is his like Picasso and if you're pedantic you're saying well Picasso is the person and uh it's actually the art piece and so good for you but um where we landed on was that uh the reason why Raid cares so much is this is his life's work and uh he's going to be fixated on every single point that matters for him in an obsessive manner um until until he's done and so uh that that resonated with me and it's it's something that I think the the way that was articulated by my my friend and explaining why uh he's so fixated in all these details even to the level where uh it it oftentimes may be considered micromanagement which is actually a bad form of management but like how are we all going to be searching for like our own sense of of what uh we'd want to pursue maybe for the rest of our lives right if we could if we're going to go do something and and found a company um and I thought about this more and uh I guess I'm going to conclude with um just a few stories for me personally um it's about you know if Raid can be so obsessed about a hedge fund like certainly anyone out there can find something based on like a cause that you care about or uh or a betterment of humanity that you could really be passionate about and for me it's always like the stories that are impacting uh people that I find most moving and so um yeah I went through and and uh like these are some of the things that have happened with with creators on on patreon that I personally followed and so this is a group called kind of funny um they actually were a group that spun out of uh I'm a gamer and so I read this site called IGN so that's where they were originally but they all quit and decided to just continue talking about um you know stories and games as a group together uh just out of their home and so initially like they were putting their stuff on youtube and they were getting maybe 15,000 to 100,000 views per video which uh you know people have an impression of nowadays when you find youtube influencers um that that's not a big number but they ended up launching a patreon page um to ask for sort of support on their endeavor um and then very quickly uh they were generating 30,000 a month on on the videos they're making and they're like well this is cool but we also really care about gaming and so they set up a second page that soon exceeded the 30,000 they were making there and uh they effectively then had two pages and they were making tens of thousands of dollars a month and so that allowed them to move out of that uh sort of home studio set up a uh a proper studio get uh upgrade their equipment um have an actual uh backjob and professional setting um um higher other folks to help them on their um on the content that they're making and then ultimately really just grow out their business and I thought that was so cool watching this group uh jump out because they cared deeply about the work they were doing um from IGN where I follow them originally and be able to rebuild back up uh their company so I thought that was awesome okay another group that uh actually it's a single individual a guy named Brande Stan is you've ever seen some of these images are humans of New York and I love what Brandon sort of does because uh he just takes images of people uh originally in New York and then sort of just like writes out their story right like one one snippet of it and I think it builds a lot of empathy and uh you just get to uh uh develop a lot of perspective about uh other people's lives this and I think it touches on a lot of things that are highly relevant and problems that people are dealing with in time and age this one uh resonated with me in particular uh it's about anxiety and so this individual talks about uh how he almost like bullied this grown high school who always talked about anxiety because it looked like nothing to him um but then you know recently when when his father died he's been dealing with his personal anxiety and realized that it wasn't anxiety to him was not about nothing it's the indiscriminable fear of nothing it's the way he talks about it um and uh humans in New York just does all these different stories that I think uh in pieces sort of helps like shine a light into different parts of humanity and and brings us closer together when they finally launched their um patreon page there was just an outpouring of support um and people talking about how uh sharing you know uh their personal stories brought so much encouragement to them um and then also how um you know actual causes like a woman being able to send her to home to school uh were sort of achieved through the stories that were shared by brand and so I thought that was awesome and then finally one of the uh uh I find uh Simone Gertz is uh is another youtuber um she makes this channel called shiti robots uh do a quick like 30 seconds here i'm Simone and I always struggle with it to see what i do because it's a little bit it's gnarly but i'm an inventor and youtuber my my videos are shiti robots hopefully they're fun i mean it's like it's some sort of robot comedy sometimes i just take a step out of outside of everything and i'm like this is really bizarre that i built useless machines and have somehow turned this into a job and into a career uh but i do like thinking like when i pay for a coffee i'm like shiti robots paid for that so Simone is awesome right she uh recently did like the thing where she converted uh tesla into a truck before the actual tesla truck uh she's been on cobert on a tettac work with uh mythbusters um pattern savage on on many things and uh last year she had a recurrence of a brain tumor and so uh in particular she shared a video at that time when it came back where she described um despite all the uncertainties and the difficulty she was facing in uh sort of her own life and going through this the the two stable certainties in her life were both her community of patrons and her mother um and uh as she sort of shared this particular example um and this video uh a lot of folks just sort of had like an outpouring of support and um just sort of seeing this uh i think both empathy from people in like a community uh sort of focusing their their love and energy to individuals and uh the internet sort of enabling this to happen with communities today um i think despite like whatever other hardships and struggles that um you know patreon goes through and will continue to go through uh it's very motivating for both the team and and myself uh to keep focusing on this and so again my my call for everyone uh who cares about doing startups and uh uh finding what uh it is that they are passionate about is to to find your Picasso or again if you're pedantic uh your uh yeah you're at your actual art piece that's it two questions okay thanks for taking the time to come here and questions of all the future all the future yeah um i think we've had a lot of discussions about um the exit per se too because uh what's been important for us is that in order to serve creators we want to be able to remain independent in our decision making and so we've been really strategic both in the partners and investors that we brought on for how we raise our money and also into whether we would sell the company to to we'll sell patreon to another company um in particular we look at like the actions of some of these largest companies and and we feel like uh it's it's difficult to trust that uh in the future they wouldn't change the trajectory or how we operate so the plan for us has always been to try to figure out a path to IPO yeah and um the the way that we get there uh uh uh has been working deeply with investors that looking at comparable metrics and just figuring out uh what we need to do in order to make it there yeah one more yeah so like your last piece of advice was kind of like to find your Picasso um in general like in the life you know there are always so many different fields like you're exploring might be learning um you know for example you were like thank you as a child before you went into like computer science um I guess I'm just interested in hearing your insight on like um in terms of like navigating so many different fields and just really keeping your mind open and learning as much as possible how do you go about finding that one that ends up being that like passion really you know over time especially if you're like starting at a younger age yeah uh right uh how can I repeat that question um basically uh what I heard was um there are a lot of different paths that you can take and and things that you can be passionate about and uh how do you sort of figure out uh the the path and maybe the focus that you want to take uh as you go through life and so I think one important distinction here I want to call out is that uh I'm not being prescriptive in in order to just like describe how to be successful I actually think there's a lot of luck involved um at least through personal experience on like what actually will work out and it's also hard to predict um what I am trying to describe is like what will make it worth it for you to to work on the problems um and and that's what I mean by like finding something you deeply care about there have been a lot of endeavors that I've worked on that have gone nowhere um and uh you look at some of these other founders too and and where they started it looks very different from where they finished and so uh the thing that will kill you for certain is if you uh just end up hitting a wall and you you don't want to do it anymore which is also fine I think as a choice but like uh ultimately if uh you're going to be exerting this much effort on something that has a high likelihood of not working out uh I think the only way you get through it is if you have deep conviction in your passion about it and so then directly to your question like as you're exploring lots of different branches and and whatnot what I found is it doesn't really matter like where your journey takes you uh I've always found it uh interesting to obsess down like deeply into one path at a time and then something else takes me to to broaden out my experience or my knowledge then then I'll follow it but I always find it more interesting to just learn as much as I can about it particularly field as I'm working on it all right thanks everyone the entrepreneurial thought leader series is a Stanford E-Corner original
