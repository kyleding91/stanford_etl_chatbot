 You were listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader's series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Today we have a special guest, Josh Reeves. I have known Josh for over 10 years. I know him super well. In fact, I think he sometimes calls me his Stanford mom. He was a Mayfield Fellow in 2005. And while he was at Stanford, he was very entrepreneurial. He majored and got his both his undergrad and his master's in electrical engineering. While he was here, he started an organization called Tech, which is Technology and Education, which is still active today with chapters all over the world. Since graduating, he started two companies. His first company was called Unwrap. And it empowered brands to benefit from social media. It was purchased by Context Optional in 2010. Two years later, after he was percolating on new ideas, he started Zen at Payroll with the mission to deliver delightful modern payroll to businesses everywhere. Josh believes in the power of software to solve complex problems. And he is going to share his insights from his experience with us. Join me in welcoming Josh. Well, it's a pleasure to be with all of you today. Part of the reason why I call Tina my Stanford mom is her son, his name Josh, as well. So there's that commonality in place. But it was 10 years ago. I actually was running ETL. So this was a seminar that I used to manage as a part of basis. I think I still might hold a record. I took this class 14 quarters in a row. So if anyone's close to beating that, please let me know as well. But the amangl of this topic of this chat is going to be walking through a couple of different chapters in my life, discussing some entrepreneurial stories, trying to share some lessons with all of you, and then hoping to have some good Q&A afterwards as well. So these are the three chapters we're going to be covering. We're going to be starting with where it all begins, upbringing and college days as well. We'll be talking about my prior two startup endeavors and then wrapping up with deep dive into Zen payroll. But with a really strong emphasis on the why, not just the how. The motivation to start a business, the values that drive it, and then the mission. What does a mission mean when you talk about startups? So in terms of growing up, I'm happy to share with you in one of the few locals I was actually born in San Francisco. I grew up in Marine County, which if you haven't been there, is great for hiking. And my parents are actually both teachers. My mom's from Bolivia. She came to the US when she was 18. My dad's from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They're both the first in their families to go to college. And so they taught mostly humanities, English, history, social studies. I didn't have too much personal exposure to technology growing up. But I was always curious about how things worked. And frankly to me, the entrepreneurial journey that my parents were on to move to a whole new country or a city or a state isn't in of itself its own story of wanting to make the most of an opportunity. So the comment thread I do see, though, which I'll come back to is that curiosity. And then always being very bothered by inefficiency, which is, as we get to this in payroll conversation, you'll get a tip of the hat on kind of why that's a relevant part of our mission for the business. But kind of bring it all back to Stanford. Again, when I was here, this building didn't even exist. We used to have these seminars in Terminodotorium, which was a beautiful building just that way, which is now a lovely fountain without any building there anymore at all. But when I came to Stanford, it was 2001, the bubble head just burst. There was actually from 2001 to 2003, 40% decline in enrollment in the CS major. If you think about that, it's kind of inverse to what's happening these days. But I was really excited to study electrical engineering. For me, W.E. was about really understanding complex systems, and I love the mathematical aspect to it. And I get asked a lot these days, was W.E. helpful, is W.E. relevant to what I'm doing today. And I think we're going to talk about that in a bit kind of how academics tied to what you do in a work environment. But the answer is absolutely now. I'm not using Fourier transforms in my day to day job, obviously. But the ability to understand complex systems and take these really, really complex problems and simplify them to a couple key things that matter, whether it's in hiring or whether it's in making a business strategy decision, whether it's in selling a product, developing software, or even in other things like politics or economic development. I really think that, again, that mindset is what's most valuable versus the actual coursework that you're going through. So kind of to share a couple of thoughts on college. Again, all of you are at Stanford, or at least a part of the Stanford community. That's incredible. This is an amazing institution. I always tell folks if I could buy stock in a university, I would buy stock in Stanford, because it's incredible to see what the university has done over the last 10, 20, 30 years in terms of really driving change in the world. But I think that question I was asked earlier, again, a lot of students asked me, what should I study to go do this? What should I study to go achieve this goal? And I think to me, the real heart and soul of college is really about discovering who you are, discovering what you care about, understanding the things that interest you. And that requires experimentation. I mean, when I was at Stanford, I worked in three different labs during my time in undergrad. I worked at four different internships each summer, different experience, different industry, different area to go deep dive, learn. When I was at Intel, my freshman summer, I emailed the entire executive team at Intel down in Santa Clara. And I said, hey, do you have 15, 20 minutes to grab coffee? We'd love to just talk. I'm a freshman intern at Intel. We'd love to get a sense of what you do and also why you do what you do. And I met with a half the executive team. And I remember at one point, talking to one of my colleagues who was a PhD graduate, and he was wondering why I was meeting with his bosses, bosses, bosses, bosses. And I just said, I emailed him. And it wasn't that hard. It was simply the act of putting out that risk of, hey, fear of rejection, but also nothing really bad happens if someone ignores your email. They don't put you on a black list. If you email them 100 times in a row, maybe. But again, one piece of advice there is send that email. As a student, you have this almost blank check to either email someone in industry, someone in the company you're working with, and just ask for some advice. And most folks that have come through your shoes, will want to give back. It's kind of the key to this entire community's idea of giving back, because we've all benefited from it tremendously. But the key thing I also wanted to emphasize there around school is that there is no right or wrong answer. I think a lot of times, again, students are looking for the right path, the key path to go achieve a specific goal. Up until you go to Stanford, it's pretty clear. Get good grades, go to a good school. Afterwards, there is no clear path. It's really what you want to make of it. So make sure you explore. But to shift into chapter two, this was, right when I was graduating, I was a Mayfield Fellow, as Tina mentioned. My internship was at a company named Zazzle. I was either going to do a PhD in neural prosthetics, which is a really interesting topic. You guys have any questions about it? Or I was going to go join a software startup. And what I concluded was what I really wanted to do was be involved in solving a problem end-to-end, where I could be understanding the customer need, developing the solution, iterating, developing, improving it, and then obviously bringing it to that customer and continuing that cycle. And so that's why I joined Zazzle full-time. I was a product manager, which is an amazing job for someone right out of school. It gives you a chance to really understand prioritization, but also, again, you're kind of responsible for a roadmap, responsible for something being done. But you're not actually a manager of anyone. So the ability to influence and inspire without being able to say, do this because I told you so, is actually a really, really useful skill to have. But what I loved about the mission in Zazzle, if you're not familiar, is it was a way for people all over the world to go build products, digital products, and then whenever someone else bite it or bought it, those products would be manufactured and shipped out. So for me as a PM, it was a chance to go and able people all over the world to make a living doing things they loved, right? Designing awesome products, expressing their creativity. And this is actually a photo of Alejandro, he's an artist in Uruguay, who literally makes tens of thousands of dollars a year by just uploading his paintings through the website at an Internet cafe near his house. So I guess the main advice I have there on kind of choosing where to go when you graduate is really think about who you want to become like. I think again, Stanford students, it's easy to kind of want to build frameworks and spreadsheets and come up with the 20 different optimizations on growth rate and funding amounts and all these different ways to determine which company you should join. One way to simplify it is just to think about who would you like to become like because you become like the people you spend time with, whether you want to or not. And so choose wisely would be the main piece of advice there. Another topic related to school that I really am passionate about, this is just one framework, there's many frameworks, but in my opinion, there really is two main types of learning. There is academic learning and then there is kind of tactical learning. And academic learning is a chance to learn purely for the sake of curiosity, right? It's why many of you are here in school today. It's a chance to go discover, try different things. You're interested in the subject, figure it out. And it's amazing, it's a huge part of my foundation. But everyone has to make a choice at some point on how much of their life should be spent doing academic learning versus tactical learning. And tactical learning happens just as much in a startup. It's learning whatever you need to learn to overcome whatever obstacles in front of you. And then you move forward again to the next obstacle. So it's a different type of learning. For me, that was a big part of why I left the PhD program was my desire to have that kind of 90-10 split on academic versus tactical learning shift to kind of a 10-90 split. And today, even now, it's really awesome to spend some time on campus, speak with different professors. I don't think you ever want to have that go to zero. But the chance to still have that curiosity be explored and whatever discipline you're focused on is really important. Otherwise, you can get caught up in its tactical piece every day. And then that can help you get burned out. So Zazel grew very quickly. I was there from about 20 employees to about 150. And then in 2008, as Tina mentioned, I started a company with a colleague of mine, actually a friend who had gone to Stanford with, but he had been at Google for four years. And the way I would summarize this startup experience, it was a two-year chapter in my life, was that it was very reactive to kind of be very open and transparent with you. Again, there's many reasons to start a company, many ways to build a business. This was right when Facebook platform launched in 2008. And I had just been finishing up my masters. I was working full-time and doing my school part-time. And I took the class at Stanford called the Facebook class, if you guys have heard about it. It kind of became a pretty infamous class because of the companies that came out of it. But what happened with this business was we were making $2,000 a day, really in our first month of operating. And it was these platform of applications where other businesses could go build apps on Facebook. If you didn't have any technical skill set. So there was some elements of, I think, mission involved in terms of enabling these business owners. But it was also just a very reactive business where we were like, hey, this is working. Let's keep doing it. And what happened was over the ensuing year, year and a half, we kept doing well financially. But it really felt like something was missing. It didn't feel like we knew where we were going over the next two, five, ten years. And as we were hiring teammates, that bothered me. If I didn't feel like this is something I could spend 10, 20 years working on. And speak about thousands and thousands of times with the same conviction and passion. Then it didn't feel right. And so that was why even though we had offers for funding at that point, we ended up going down the acquisition route. It was because it didn't, and no judgment on the space of social media. If you guys are passionate about it, you have to find what's authentic to you. But it just was too fluffy for us. And that was why we went through the acquisition. So that kind of leads to a really important, I think, message, which is the power of introspection. I mean, I went through a period afterwards for a few months, really trying to understand what I enjoyed doing in the previous several years. What I wanted to do different, what had worked, what hadn't worked. And this is a message in general, not just related to, you know, in between startup chapters. I mean, I think one of the beauties of school is you have these quarter systems, right? We're basically every, in between every quarter, you have to decide what classes do I like, and what classes do I not like, in which classes do I want to do different next quarter. And if you can imagine when you start working, those quarters go away. You know, you can have 10 years of work passed by without ever taking a step back to determine, do I like what I'm doing? And a lot of folks that don't take that time and end up being unhappy, even though they're quote unquote successful professionally, because they haven't taken the time to really think about, is this what they want to spend their time doing? So my biggest advice here is, even when you graduate, set up your own quarter semester system. It could be weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly, whatever cycle you're on. This is a photo of Palo Alto, Foothills Park. I used to, when I live down here, go down there every Sunday. It's just over Page Mill. And it's a gorgeous park, but for me, nature is a place to find solace. Whatever it is that gives you that place to think more deeply about what's working, what's not working. Make sure you set aside that time. Otherwise, life will just pass you by. So for me, that introspection led to a pretty extensive kind of thought process around what had been missing in my prior start-up. Why had I, even though it was succeeding quote unquote financially, why was I still kind of feeling like there was something missing? And the answer for me was, it didn't feel like a mission. You know, when I had started the nonprofit in college, and we were building this movement around helping students in the US and China go do social projects together, get to know each other better, try to help other people. You know, I would be working till four or five in the morning. I'd be recruiting students. We built up all these different chapters, and it didn't feel like work. It just felt like something that I really believed in and I really cared about. And I was happy to talk to you pretty much to anyone I met. And so I kind of went through this introspective process to figure out what are the types of problems I really cared about. And this was the outcome of that. It was really understanding that, you know, these are the types of missions that I could get behind. And we're going to influence how I wanted to spend the rest of my life. And so to go through the three, and again, these are just personal to me. They can be very different for you. It was number one, businesses that helps someone make a living doing something they love. That was kind of why I had joined Zazzle in the first place. It was incredible to empower someone to follow their passions and be able to then live in a capitalistic world with the capital they need to survive. Two is businesses that helps someone do something they've always wanted to do. More from an empowerment standpoint. It's one of the most amazing aspects of technology. It's the ability to kind of take things that previously used to require tons of equipment or tons of money or tons of people. And now, you know, literally one person can do it. I mean, what's happening with the drones right now for photography and videography is incredible. I have a lot of friends that are really enjoying some of those technologies. And then the third was kind of back to my earlier point on being bothered by inefficiency. Any kind of product solution that just brings massive time savings, massive cost savings to the world was something that I could really get behind. So that kind of leads to the third chapter, which is the creation of Zen Payroll. So Zen Payroll, we started the company about three years ago. And I have two co-founders. We're actually all electrical engineering from Stanford. So I kind of joke that WLE has a lot to do with payroll software. Actually, our head of design is also WLE. Our first engineer was WLE. My life is WLE, actually. But nothing against people that are not WLE. We really brought us together before we kind of dive into how we built the business. We brought us together, again, is not some mapping of strategic skill sets or some spreadsheet optimized on complimentary value ad. It was values, right? To me, all of us had had prior startups. We were all at a very similar stage in life of wanting to go solve a problem that we could imagine spending the rest of our life working on. And that was what glued us together. It wasn't, again, some logical mapping of skill. It was, frankly, the three of us connecting around kind of what we cared about in life and what we believed in. And so that's one advice I have for folks that are interested in starting companies. When you're starting, especially with who you choose to partner with and found a company with, and the way that matters way, way more than skill or expertise is understanding that person's motivations, understanding what they stand for and making sure that's aligned with your motivations. Otherwise, it's going to be hard to go build that business together for the long term. And I think the way I would summarize that is, again, there's many ways to build a company. We were solving a problem by creating a business. We were not interested in creating a business to go solve a problem. It's, again, a very different mindset to kind of be focused on the problem as your starting point versus all the logistics of building a company. So in terms of how did we choose this idea, we really had two catalysts. One was we had all run prior startups. So we had all kind of been through that journey. We had sold prior companies too, but we had all run payroll. So that was one personal frustration. If any of you have run payroll using historical legacy systems, it's a pretty time consuming process. And then two, almost a coincidence to realize how many people have small businesses in their family. Each of us had family that had run payroll too. So Tomer, who runs our product team, his father owns a small clothing store in Haifa, Israel. And he had been helping his dad in the back office since he was a kid. Edward, who runs our engineering team, his mother runs payroll for a doctor's office in LA. And then my mother-in-law actually runs payroll for companies down in Silicon Valley. So those are kind of the two catalysts. And again, in terms of the business types that we were attracted to, I kind of bucket those into two worlds. There's businesses that are out there to go invent whole new use cases for the future. Things that have never existed before. And Facebook is a great example. And the biggest puzzle there is, will a billion people want this? Will two billion people want to use this? But there's also a whole other category of businesses that are about really just fixing existing problems, improving existing industries, using changes in technology, shifts in society to go kind of redo what has been done in the past. And these are companies like Nest, right? Redoing how thermostat's function, companies like Square, redoing how point-and-sale systems function. The three of us all gravitated towards this category. Kind of the ability to, from day one, with one customer, know that we were actually solving a real problem. Really resonated with us. And again, there's many entrepreneurs that have been successful in both buckets, but try to figure out, as you think about your journey, which one you gravitate towards, because it's hard to move to the other unless it's what you really believe in. So the way we got started, as any startup shoot is talking to customers. This is a Christina Estembelle. She actually started a company called Farm Girl Flowers in San Francisco. It's actually a really cool story, which you guys should all use for product. It's a great flower service. But we talked a lot of these customers, and we were pretty shocked to learn. Again, it wasn't just our pain point. If you're building a business just for yourself, you have to figure out how big is the market. How many people actually share this pain? And we were shocked by two statistics. Number one, we were shocked by the fact that of the six million businesses in the US today, about a third of them every year get fined for incorrectly doing their payroll taxes. And that's every year about a third of companies make mistakes and get penalized. And then the second stab we're shocked by is that about 40% of the six million businesses that need payroll do payroll today by hand. So they do it on spreadsheets. They do it manually. Eddie's mother was one example, having done it by hand for 25 years. And so that was shocking to us. They didn't make any sense. If you look at payroll, it's a set of complex rules, 15,000 different tax codes. These are entrepreneurs. These are small business owners that have been wearing 20 different hats, trying to figure it all out on their own. And they haven't really had the benefit of software to help them, because they weren't really a cost effective market to go serve. And that's changed, right? Now these folks are on the internet. They have mobile devices. They use Google to search for new products to use. They're finally an audience that you can bring a service to. And it was very clear to us that payroll should not be done by hand. And so we wanted to build a product. I used Gmail as the analogy. You don't have to know how S&TP or IMAP or Pop 3 works to send a message to someone. You shouldn't have to know all the different tax codes and compliance requirements to go pay someone, right, to go build a business, which is really a lot of the foundation of the American economy. And so those were two stats that shocked us. And then I think the second thing I'll mention is, we had never done payroll before. And I think this is a lesson too for a lot of folks that sometimes get intimidated by, oh, I've never worked in that industry before. How can I solve it? How could I do something better? It's actually a huge strength to not have been in an industry before. As long as you know what you don't know, too, right? So obviously, when it came to payroll compliance, we hired some folks with 20 years of experience in taxes and compliance because that has to be done correctly. But when we looked at payroll, many of you probably today, when you hear the word payroll, think of it as this chore or this hassle. Or don't even know what it really is until you get paid. We thought of it very differently. And for us, we thought of it as having these two building blocks. On the one side, it's an employee getting paid. Hopefully, all of you are in this boat, too, but people love to get paid. I mean, every two weeks, we send an email to tens of thousands of people that says, you got paid today. And that comes from the same payroll. You can guess what the open rate is of that email. What the click through rate of that email is. So that seems pretty magical, right? We're kind of enabling this really meaningful part of what it means to work. And on the other side, it's employers rewarding their employees for their hard work. It's helping them feel appreciated for what they've done. And that was a shocking realization. Again, for us, that seemed like common sense, but that's not how this industry has worked in the past. And the past payroll has been an ID number where you get a specific employee number ID. And then you kind of have a transaction. You don't even know when you get paid. It's in your bank account. And for us, this seemed very clear that payroll is actually in reality more about people than payments, right? It's about this relationship between these two stakeholders. So that was something that really influenced how we think about the business. And one of our investors is Drew from Dropbox. They have a very similar story where their first 100 employees, no one had a background in storage because Dropbox was not building storage systems. What they were building was a new way to share and access your information. So don't be intimidated by your lack of knowledge. Again, in many ways, it can be a huge asset to you as well. Just to quickly highlight kind of what our mission is, and then we'll come back to kind of the Y and the How. This is how we think about our identity today. It's to go take all of that unnecessary pain. All of that difficulty that a small business owner has to go through and remove it, right? I mean, these are folks that have been on their own for a long time. No one's told them to go start a business. If any of you go start your own businesses too, it's really a labor of love. And it's not just done to go create huge businesses that IPO. Oftentimes, it's business owners that are paying for their family, covering their cost of living. And we want to remove that pain. A third of companies should not be getting fined every year for incorrectly doing their payroll taxes. The second is to really celebrate this human aspect of what it means to work. In Silicon Valley, we talk a lot about wanting your work to matter, wanting to have impact with what you do. We really believe that same message applies to flower shops, bakeries, cafes, churches, spread across the country. And one of our goals is to bring that ability to those businesses. And then the third one is all about the employee. This is, again, when you think about different trends in society, people now work in many companies throughout their life. And so the ability to help people save better, plan for retirement better is the key part of our mission as well. But to kind of dive now into the journey as well, this is a fun photo. We were in a white combinator during the winter 2012 batch, living in a house not too far from here. And whenever you start a company, it's a pretty intense time. We're spending a lot of hours together. My commute was walking upstairs, which was pretty phenomenal. Today it's about half block walk, which isn't too bad either. But one funny anecdote to share during that time, Eddie actually was living in a city two hours of commuting every day. Doesn't make too much sense. So we rented him our closet for $350 a month. And to be clear to it, it had a queen size bed in it, it had a skylight. Probably would rent for like $3,000 a month in San Francisco these days, given rent prices. Again, it kind of reinforces that message that it's about shared values and really being excited to spend that amount of time together because it is a very intense experience to build a company. In the same vein, one thing I also love to talk about is kind of the approach to fundraising. For us, fundraising has never been about capital. It's about people. And if you think about it from that perspective, you can almost apply the same lens you do to fundraising as you do to hiring. So for us, when we hire someone, it's about their values, their motivation, and their skill set. When we fundraise, it's the same idea. This person is now going to become a part of your community. They're going to be an ambassador for your business. They're going to represent you in an external context. And so for us, we think about it as very analogous. And these are, again, some amazing folks that we're proud to have involved. These folks didn't invest because of the desire to simply make a 10X, 50X, 100X return on their investment. They invested because they really cared about the mission. And this is one thing that makes Silicon Valley really special. All of you are a part of this community. It's not a zero-sum game. That's what makes, in my opinion, Silicon Valley really tick. This idea that there is a camaraderie amongst entrepreneurs where you want to help each other out. And if you care about the mission, you share values with the founder. Then by all means, you want to support that individual. So business is doing well. We can gloss over this. We're proud to be serving many, many companies. We have a lot more work to do. I mean, any success that we've had thus far is due to the team we've built. And ultimately, we're never done. I mean, that's, I think, one of the key lessons and start-ups, something I tell my team pretty often is that we can always get better. I think if you're part of a growing company, we're about 75 employees today. We'll be a couple of hundred by the end of the year. There's an easy pattern to kind of get into where you want to solve a problem, fix it, be done with it, and then never come back to it. And the magic of a startup, and also sometimes the frustration, is that you can solve a problem, have a great conversation, fix that issue, and then three days later, five people joined the company. They weren't there for that. So now they have to go figure out what's going on again from day one. And so that ability to repeat, and it actually looked forward to repeating these discussions, and know that every time you can get better, has been a key part of our growth thus far. So I kind of mentioned values a few times. This is a topic I really love talking about. And I was at a panel recently where someone said you'd talk more about values in any founder they've met, and I'm proud to be called a values founder if that's what I'm known as. You're never going to see our values on our wall. These are just a couple of them. You're never going to see them printed out on placards. Values are who you are. You don't have personal values, professional values. It's really what you stand for. And again, there's no black and white answer here. There's no right or wrong value. But if you're building a team or building an organization, you want to understand your identity. And then it mostly impacts hiring. It impacts the way that you decide to add people to your team. Otherwise you can become very, very split in terms of what your mission is. So just to walk through these three, and by all means, if these resonate with you, feel free to use them, make them a part of whatever mission you're on. But one of our core values is ownership mentality. And for us, this really means two things. Again, in Silicon Valley, every startup gives equity to their employees. But I think a lot of folks overlook the second impact of giving equity. Because it definitely aligns for economic outcomes. That's fair. But the other impact is that everyone in a startup is an owner of the business, literally. And no one should be treated like an employee. So as a management team, you have to think about how to go empower folks as owners, where no one's there just to accomplish a single task. And this one really mattered a lot to me when I was at Intel. And I had a great time at Intel. But I remember one anecdote where during that summer, I wanted to work on a project. No one was working on it. I needed to get done. And I volunteered to do it. And someone told me, don't do it. It's not your job to do it. And that thought really stuck with me, right? How does that make sense? How does that work? How does a company develop that mindset? And this to us is basically the emphasis of that, right? It's how do you empower people to not just come in and do one job or do one specific task. But to be there to accomplish this common mission and then do whatever they can to make that a reality. The second one is how I started. Again, I think one opinion I have on society is I think we're all moving towards a much, much faster cadence in terms of instant gratification from whatever we do, whether it's in media or politics or stocks. But building things that are really great that have big impacts in the world take time. If you do have that choice or that goal to go build something for the long term, then it's really important to know what that means day to day. In our case, it means how we hire, it means how we fundraise, a bunch of different lessons. So again, there's nothing wrong with wanting to build a company for a two years and then planning to sell it. But if your goal is to go build it for the long term and make that a core part of your DNA, otherwise you can have a misalignment within your team. And then the last one is really connected to the first transparency. Again, there's many different ways to run meetings in a business. In our case, every two weeks we have all hands where literally we walk through financials, performance metrics, lessons learned. I share things that I've done wrong if I've made a mistake. And I own that in terms of ways that we can improve as an organization. And again, it sets a great example to others in terms of trusting your team. If you're going to be an owner in a business, you should be given the information to think like an owner. Otherwise, a lot of companies get cut up in this privacy secrecy type thing where it almost turns into a distrust thing where you don't trust someone with the information that they want because you're afraid what they might do with it. I'd rather just hire people that we trust from day one and then empower them to be owners in the business. Another topic I get asked a lot about is how does the role of CEO evolve or change? What does it mean to be a CEO? This was a question I asked myself a lot when I was at Intel as well where the CEO of Intel literally had, I think at that point, they were 70,000 employees. And I wondered, how does a person leading a 70,000 person company know how to spend his or her time? You could literally have like an hour free and call ahead of state or call a journalist or hire someone or do all these different tasks. How does that not just overload your synapses? And the answer is, in some ways, it's all about delegation. It's about firing yourself from as many jobs as you can. It's a path I've been on since early days of the company. But what that leaves is kind of where I am focused. These are the three things that I've concluded are really my long-term responsibilities as a leader in a growing company. The first is really making sure we've set good direction and strategy for the business. Everyone's looking to me to help facilitate but then ultimately drive what matters, right? Where are we focused? Why are we making this bet? Why is this the direction that's best for the company? And that's something that ultimately I have to be responsible for. The second is, how do we organize? How do we communicate? How many meetings do we have? When do we have meetings? Why should we have meetings? And then also, how do we hire? Which role should we create? Which team should we create? And what responsibility is do we give to those individuals? And then the third one is, again, really personal. It's the chance to lead by example. It's basically my actions being what everyone reads into. And most of that manifests in the context of hiring. Where I spend 50% of my time interviewing people. That might seem crazy to hear that. But that's the way it's been for two years now. And that's probably the way it'll be for the next five or ten years. And so interviewing is a really important skill. If you guys have any questions you can talk to me after. But the ability to interview I think is something that everyone should build as a skill set. When I was at Zazel, as a first job at a school, I was at PM, but I also volunteered to run all of our Stanford College recruiting. It's just like a muscle you have to iterate and get better at it through practice. And interviewing, again, you can always get better. So kind of to get closer to wrapping, I just wanted to highlight it. I think it's an incredible time to be in technology and startups. I list out some businesses here, but really the main message is there's a lot of problems out there. And a business exists to solve a problem. So as long as there are problems, there are opportunities for new businesses to be created. And so my encouragement to you is to find a problem that really matters to you, something you care about, something that you really believe should be solved. And that really, again, affects you that it's still persisting in that way. The same way that for us, realizing that it was a third of companies getting fined and all these businesses being run as if it was a transactional system versus a business being about people and community. But that's what spoke to us. If you find something that speaks to you, there's a lot of problems out there waiting to be solved. And now that's the magic of entrepreneurship is this idea of wanting to take the impossible and make it real. And against all odds, with a team that shares a value system and is on this mission, kind of say we can do it, say we can do something that everyone says we can't do. And so again, Stanford is a big part of that. Many of you are already a part of that community, but it's really inspiring to me to see all these examples around us. And again, all the cool ideas and projects that will come in the future. So to kind of wrap on these three lessons in a summary format, number one, introspection. These are kind of the three I would love to make sure you remember. Make sure you set aside that time. Maybe in school, it doesn't seem like you needed because of the quarters or semesters. But definitely after school, create some structure that makes you take a step back, detach from the day to day. In our company, we care so much about this that on everyone's one year anniversary, we give them a free plane ticket anywhere in the world. And they have to use it by their second year. So we basically force them to leave. And that's a way for us to get them to go, again, leave, detach, take a step back, and really think about what they're doing, what they care about. And they come back to healthier person, they come back to healthier teammate. Now, you can do that on a smaller scale. For me, Sunday afternoons, and when I go to the gym are really my places of introspection, where I try to detach from email, detach from Slack, or all the different projects I'm working on, and just kind of again, think more broadly about what's working, what's not working, how am I spending my time? Number two is, again, when you decide to join your first company out of school, one way to think about it is not this huge complex framework on all these different optimizations, but rather decide who you want to become like. When you spend time with them, when you're interviewing, interviewing isn't just about them learning about you. It's reciprocal. You're learning about them, right? And that's your privilege. That's your right to basically ask them questions, understand what they stand for. You know, it's not just about asking for the job, what am I going to do? Who's my boss? But ask things like, you know, why do you do this? Why does this matter to you? What is your motivation? I kind of sometimes channel my inner two-year-old, I just ask why, over and over again, right? Just why. Someone answers, and I say why. And you kind of really give back to the core of what drives someone. And if you're going to join a company, you really want to understand what drives the person you're joining, because you're going to become more like them, whether you want to or not. And then the third one, which probably comes across in how I talk about what I'm doing, if you're starting a business, imagine the 10,000th time you're going to be talking about it. And think about it if you'll be just as excited and just as passionate as the first time. Because by the 10,000th time, you definitely can't fake it. And that was what drove me my last business to want to sell it. And with this business, this is probably my 500,000th time describing our mission's EP. Every time is a privilege. Every time is a chance to share with someone something I believe in and care about. And ask yourself if you're mission driven, if that will exist, because you can't, again, artificially create that. It has to be there or not. So in closing, I want to actually read this quote to everyone. It's a little bit long, but I think it's very relevant. This is a quote from Steve Jobs. And I think it's a great way to kind of drive home this message. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact. And that is everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it. You can influence it. You can build your own things that other people can use. That's maybe the most important thing. It's to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you're just going to live in it. Versus embrace it. Change it. Improve it. Make your mark upon it. And I think, again, Steve Jobs puts everything perfectly. And so rather than me trying to paraphrase, I thought it'd be better to read it to you. And that is the magic of entrepreneurship. That's the privilege we have in being a part of this community is the chance to go kind of have these bold ideas. And against a law, I'd say, hey, we're going to go make that a reality. And so if you guys have any questions from me, I'm happy to answer them. If you're up in San Francisco, please come visit. If I can be helpful to you, please let me know. So, Q&A. I'll throw the first question out. Yeah. So you talked about your tricks of interviewing. For those of us who do it a lot, it would be super great to get some of your secret insights. Secret insights. So the question is about interviewing. So most of my interviews, I'm now usually the last person in the interview process because there's a lot of other folks involved before that. So my interviews are primarily focused not on skill set, but on values and motivation. So the way I usually love to have that discussion, I mean, the main tip is that why, which is whenever someone answers, it's easy to see them get into a pattern of listing out accomplishments or skill sets. Ask why. Ask if they made a life change. Why they made that change? And so I always usually phrase the question. To me, life is about chapters. I love reading. So I call them chapters. My colleague loves baseball. He calls them innings. But I ask, you know, for these different chapters you've been through, why do you make that transition? What were you looking for? What was different? What was working? What wasn't working? And then for this next chapter you're envisioning, what do you want? What are you looking for? Because the whole goal of the interview is not to have me grill them or them to grill me. It's to understand if there's an alignment, right? The whole point is just to get to know each other better, understand your values, motivation, and skill set, and then figure out, hey, there is a match year in terms of what we need and what we want and what you are interested in doing and providing. And so that's one of the ways that I get to that answer. Any more questions? Right here. Obviously, like, the payroll is different in each state. How do you approach, like, a new state with a new set of revelations where, you know, maybe it just doesn't work in one state? How do you approach, like, the dead cases, you know? Yeah. Parallels are very complex. I joke about it. You know, we started two years ago. We launched two years ago. We live for three years. We went kind of public access two years ago. Parallels never in beta, never in pilot. So we never had a period of trial. It has to work right from day one. But we started only in California. And today we're in 40 states. We'll be in all 50 in the next three months. Every state is actually more like a country. So I kind of joke that we've launched 40 countries now because of the way that U.S. was created, states set their own policies around tax, around compliance, around reports. So that's much of our, I would say, secret sauce, is the ability to take all of that complexity, all of that paperwork. You know, a business is not made better by writing their name in a better font, right? They just have to write their name. And, you know, we have to do that for them automatically. So they can focus more on the people's side of their business. But it is a complex technical task. Yeah. If you have to make any sacrifices for the sake of your mission for states, they do be a mission like global innovation. Yeah. So I think absolutely. The question was about any sacrifices or trade-offs we've had to make in the context of our mission. There's trade-offs all the time. And it basically, it to me, it ties to prioritization. I mean, the biggest puzzle in the business, and I get that asked that question a lot too, is not, what are all the cool things we could do? It's, what should we do now, right? Because if you're in a business, it doesn't have a lot to do. You're probably not in a very interesting business. So I just assume we have a million things to do at all times forever. And so then the puzzle is, you know, what we do next, what we do after that. So for us, the value system on long-term thinking is why we launched only in California. It's also why we didn't rush launching other states where we would be, we could have a nationwide with about a partial solution. We have to do your compliance yourself, we do the payments for you. And we knew that we wanted to be comprehensive and develop a brand that said you can trust us with every detail. So we basically took two years that could have taken three months to be nationwide because we want to build a business for the long term. So every value, I think, again, it drives a behavior where you want to see if you're authentic to it. And it's not black and white. That's probably one of the trickiest parts of strategy is that, you know, if there's black and white decisions, that's almost ethical, right? And that's pretty clear. It's like the right way to treat someone, the right way to hire, the right way to empower someone. And the tricky part of strategy is you have these two extremes and then you have where you want to be. And the way I think about it is you want to set a goal. We want to be here in terms of our target and then you want to hold yourself accountable to it. So the key is the accountability piece, right? If you set a goal of, hey, we're going to be more focused on growth this quarter versus more focused on architecture, then make sure that you know where you want to be in that process and then hold yourself accountable to it. Yeah. So you mentioned about choosing people you admire. So maybe a few people really influence the way you think about starting companies from the same business. Yeah. So the question was talking about role models and kind of who I admire, who I look up to. We feel privileged. A lot of the folks I look up to are now investors in ZP. So Randy Comazar, who actually I met through Stanford in a class he taught before he joined Kleiner Perkins. He's one of our investors. He's been a personal mentor for 10 years. He's given one of his books, The Monk in the Rittle. It's a great book on living a purpose, driven life. So he's someone that I'm proud to have involved in the community. And then from an operator standpoint, Jeremy Stauffman is also someone that has always been inspiring to me. Again, really interesting story in terms of how they started the Yelp, which I can get to later if you want. But I encourage you to look through the investor list. I guess one message I have though on mentorship. I think sometimes people confuse it with wanting to create this kind of hierarchical structure. Like here's my once-a-quarter meeting or a set of meetings I want to have with people. Mentorship or gaining advice can happen in many ways. It can happen through reading a quote. It can happen through watching a video. It can happen through absolutely face-to-face interactions. My mentors are my parents as well. In terms of the example they've set to me and the kind of passion they had for creating a whole new life in this new place that enable me to go do what I want to do. So I would just say it's not about collecting famous names or collecting people that you can add to your resume. It really is about the interaction you have with that individual. Yeah. So you talked quite a bit about the value of introspection and how that's led a lot of your choices. But I was wondering, do you talk a little bit more about the conversation that you actually have with yourself during the intercession? How do you go about defining studies personal dialogue in the first place and do that over it? So you talk about the course of time as well. Yeah, definitely. So the question was about introspection and kind of how that journey has evolved for me. And it's still evolving. I mean, for me, meditation is a key ingredient to that in terms of detaching from the frenetic nature of the day to day and just creating almost a more peaceful moment in my day to go think about those types of questions. But I don't have a rigid structure. It's not like I have four questions I ask myself and then see how I map and give myself a grade. It's mostly tied to kind of, I would say, two buckets. One is, have I spent the time the way I wanted to spend my time? And again, that might seem easy to say, but you actually have to collect data to get that sense, right? You can say, hey, this week I want to spend half my time on recruiting. And then, or I want to spend 10% of my time exercising. And then it actually takes a little bit of homework to figure out, hey, I actually spent 2% of my time exercising and 70% of my time recruiting. What's wrong? How do I calibrate? Maybe I should stop doing this, start doing that, delegate this, give this to someone else. So that's one key part of it. It's kind of the time allocation and seeing if I'm doing what I want to do. Otherwise, you just become reactive to the environment you're in. The second one is, is more just call it like, pontification, but it's just me thinking and dreaming a bit about what the future looks like. And different things that could exist, either in my personal life, professional life, we're kind of trying to push the envelope. And that, again, is, you could call that creativity, I think Tina obviously is very passionate on this topic. That's an interesting part of business building. So much of a business is analytical and framework driven and data-centric. We have metrics on growth and revenue rates and hiring ramps. But then so much of business building is this emotional quality of people. And people are not objects or metrics. People are unique in their own way. And that's the whole point of hiring great people. Let's go right here. I'm interested in the development of your wish to create a non-business. So is it something that you had from a very young age or did it develop during your time or Stanford? Yes. So the question was about my desire to create a business. I guess the way I would phrase it, I've never had a desire to create a business. What I realized, and definitely it wasn't, Stanford. Because before that, I was just more curious. I was bothered by an efficiency. I was curious to learn new things. I felt really good to help other people. I was in Boy Scouts, I'm an Eagle Scout. We did a lot of work that was service-centric visiting my mother's homeland, which is Bolivia, a lot of opportunity to go contribute back. That was felt good, but those are just building blocks. Stanford gave me more of a framework on this thing called high-tech venture formation. And the idea of how to use technology with business in a capitalist society to go solve meaningful problems. But even after that, and in my motivation is not to build a business, it's to go solve a problem. And that's kind of how we think about hiring as well, is that we exist as a company to go solve a problem. And by the way, what we're doing that is we're creating a company as a name. It's for profit, it's registered in Delaware. We have profit targets, revenue targets. I mean, that's still all there. But the driver is solving a problem. This is all just a by-product. And so if you remember my story, the first startup I started, we didn't have a lot of that introspection in place. It just was reactive to just this part of it. And as a result, we didn't really know where we were going over time. It was just working financially. But then something was missing. It was after that where I had that time for introspection that it really crystallized to me on what would make me happy, which is always starting with the problem. So that took, I guess I was at 28.29 when that realization happened. Hopefully, my advice to you, that's that happened earlier on in your life. Yeah. I'm curious, you've used a competition. And have the legacy payroll operators have it changed at all? Yeah. I think on a business related question like that, I'll just chat with you. I want to try to focus on giving some advice to students. But happy to answer that afterwards. Yeah? Yeah. Well, you studied in Stanford, and you also said there are some simulations. Invest in your company because they want to support your cost. Yeah. Do you think it will be the same as you have if you were to study here, if you want to locate us here outside of the city? In terms of investment and connections. Yeah. The question was related to how Stanford impacted the path we've been on and how much it's helped that. So to be clear, going to Stanford is absolutely a plus. If it was a negative, I would tell you all that. But no, it's a massive plus. But I would put it in the same bucket of, look, it's not a prerequisite to building a business. I mean, there's many entrepreneurs, many of my teammates that joined, that went to various universities, didn't go to university. So I would put it into the bucket of, look, there's a lot of ways that people or programs or skillset can help. But one of the beautiful aspects of startup is that all of that goes away. When you're just three people sitting in a house, trying to go build something and decide where you should be spending your time, all that matters is the way you spend your time. And so whatever you don't know, I mean, I think Stanford gives you some frameworks. It again gives you this incredible community of people that can help you, which you should all stand touch with each other because wonderful people go on and do wonderful things. But I really think, no matter what your background is, that's what makes Silicon Valley special is that if you don't know something, you can go learn it. I mean, I can talk now a lot about leadership and product and sales and marketing. I didn't take a lot of courses in those subjects. I went and did it. And then I'm the type of person that when I was doing something, I wanted to do it well. And so you can kind of think about it from that framework. If you want to learn how to do something, and you're someone that you believe really wants to do it well, just make yourself do it. And there's a pretty good bet you're not going to do it poorly. You're going to try to do whatever you can to do it well. And in that process, you're going to learn a ton about how to do that thing. If that helps. Yeah. It said that what we do is not important, but what we do is, and what do you think about it? And how wise are you? Yeah, so the question was around kind of team. And it's not just what we do, it's who we do it with. So I obviously really, really agree with that message. The way I describe it in our business is it's not just about accomplishing a goal. It's about being proud of how we accomplish that goal. And the way you accomplish a goal is based on people. It's day-to-day interactions, the team, the people that we contribute to that add to our community. And so I think again, there's many ways to build a business. But if you do adhere to this philosophy and wanting to be proud of the journey versus just celebrate the destination, then you can never go wrong by overly focusing on people. Again, it's the biggest enabler of success or failure. Yes. Sorry, part of that team was so many people coming from W8. Did you ever have some issues with teams that were skill sets when you're starting? Yes, the question was around kind of my coming on so many W.Fokes in the company. And was there a downside of that? So I think, I mean, the broader question is really, how similar or different should we be? And I think it's really important to clarify, value system is a philosophy. And again, we don't have the perfect value system. We just have one that we believe is right for us. Skill sets, personality biases, the variety of ways that make us all very different and unique, really important to have as much diversity there as possible. So I think from a double-east standpoint, we all had a bias towards a very analytical way of thinking. Now, in the context of our products and our business, that actually is a prerequisite, because our big insight early on was the ability to go automate this and then make it totally more humane, I guess, as the way to put it. But to be clear, we only have about five or six people now out of 75 that are double-eased. So there's more of a coincidence in terms of our early hiring. Go ahead. Any recommendations from going to being three people in a house to create awareness about your products? How do we go from one state to the whole state? Yeah. How do people become aware that your system is just open? Yeah. So I think the question was around kind of marketing and awareness building. In particular, when you're just three people in a house, how do you get usage? So I think, again, it depends on your product. If you're a consumer product, it could be as simple as listing in the App Store. If you're a B2B product, it's a very different go-to-market. I guess my message on the B2B side is, get out of the house. I mean, literally, like if you want to have 10 customers, go find those 10 customers. And even before you build your product, go talk to them and say, hey, I'm thinking of building this. Here's what it will look like. Even be a scribble or a list of bullet points and say, hey, if this exists, would you want it? And if you get a lot of people that said, yes, yes, that would be magical. That would be amazing. I would love that. And then you go build it and say, hey, here, I build what you just were running. It's here. Try it. Then you have users. You have customers, right? So that would be the starting point is don't think that it's just through a blog post or a website or ads. We didn't do any advertising for the first year and a half of the company. It was purely organic, driven by very high NPS, great customer satisfaction. Again, building a product that actually works. A lot of companies rush too fast to paid acquisitions, spending money on Google and such. Nothing wrong with that. But if you do that too early on, you don't know if you've actually solved the problem. You're just driving a lot of users through in an unnatural, not cost effective way. One more question? Yeah, last question. So you're clearly incredibly thoughtful about everything. One of the things that are keeping you awake at night now. Hmm. Well, right now I am in the middle of planning my wedding. So that's one thing that's been on my mind quite a bit. But beyond that, I think one way that also answered that question. I get asked, and it will keep you up in night. I sleep great. And that doesn't mean that we don't have a lot to do. There's not a lot of problems to solve. There's not a lot of work to get done. But I think that's actually a really important note to make. There's a certain culture and Silicon Valley that celebrates heroics. And you know, you stayed up all night, great job. And trust me, I've done that in the past quite a bit. But I have a saying in the company that I think really drives this message home. You know, heroism doesn't scale. Heroes become martyrs. And if you want to build an enduring business that scales many, many years or decades into the future, you have to build a way to grow that ties to distributing responsibilities, empowering others to be owners. So when I think about what keeps me up in night, although I sleep well, it's one of the main puzzles in our business. And in our case, it's focus. It's, are we spending our time on the right things? Are we investing our resources in the right projects? And then kind of compared to that as well, it's even that we're growing very quickly. You know, we're going to be adding, you know, 150 people to the company this year going from 75 to over, you know, 200 people. Are we maintaining the culture that makes us special? Are we maintaining the quality of service that has built our success thus far? And that ties to a lot of internal things. Most of my time right now when I talk to investors or talk to the team is spent thinking about organization, thinking about the way we communicate, the way we hire. And the way we celebrate people's first days in the company and all the traditions associated with that. Great. Join me in thanking Josh for this amazing time.
