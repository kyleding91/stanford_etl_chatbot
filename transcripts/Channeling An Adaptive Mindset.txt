 Who you are defines how you build. This is the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you by Stanford E Corner. On today's episode, we have Mniche Chandra, Founder and CEO of Poshmark, an online marketplace for buying and selling clothes. Prior to his success with Poshmark, Mniche was the founder of Kaboodle, another social shopping company. Here's Mniche. Thank you. So what I'm going to talk to you a little bit about is sort of something that isn't talked about as much, which is love and how it impacts the growth of your business. I understand a lot of you are engineering students and I'm at one day I was sort of one myself which was studying computer science. But today sort of what we are doing is really helping in a broad sense people sell shoes and clothes across the country. And so I'm going to share a little bit about my journey from being a database nerd, a computer science graduate to sort of for the last 10, 12 years building, shopping communities particularly centered around fashion. And today Poshmark is actually going beyond fashion into other areas as well. So before we get started let me share a little bit about myself. So I grew up in India. I was there for the first 19 years of my life. I came here in 87 when I was 19 years old. I grew up primarily in multiple different cities. And I think part of what shaped me was the fact that as I had to move from city to city I had to adapt and quickly sort of respond to changing climates. I began to imagine as a kid moving from school to school constantly it was kind of a trauma. A byproduct of that was for some reason I got to skip a couple of grades. So I finished high school when I was 15 which was both good and bad in some ways it sort of sounds interesting but you're trying to then leave home and go to a different city and get into a college and try to study. I mean how many of you are freshmen here? Any freshmen? So if you can imagine being a freshman at 15 and having come to a school and living away from your town it was kind of a crazy time and there was a lot of learnings there. But that was sort of the foundation that was created which was growing up in these small towns and part of what that trained me for was flexibility which is being able to adapt to different circumstances which is being a little bit of my journey throughout my career. As Ravi mentioned I went to a school called IIT Kanpur which was in India and that was kind of an interesting process too because I actually didn't know what school I was going to because I was only 13 when I was thinking about colleges and then sort of suddenly realized that I wanted to go to this very specific school called IIT Kanpur which had this computer science program and they only took 15 students every year in this program. Now I told my dad either I'm going to go to this program I'm going to sit out a year and he said are you crazy you got to apply to more schools than this one school and I said no that's the only school I want to go to. He forced me to apply to a couple other schools but I was sort of very hyper focused on getting into this program and the way that the admissions process works is you get ranked and based on your ranking you get to select which school you get to. So there's like six or seven IITs and more now. So I got I think I'd my rank was like 41 or 43 which typically would not get you into that school which typically would get you into a different school but somehow that year 1 2 3 4 5 ranks shows to go to a different IIT so I was a 15 student admitted. So I think some of my life has been shaped by good luck as well where said, Indipity and good luck and focus sort of get you into these things. Anyway it was a great experience learned a lot and from there I came to Texas and went to UT Austin as sort of doing and role prop H.D. program but after a while decided that that was sort of not a journey that I wanted to pursue. So I took a master's dropped out and moved to the valley and and joined Intel and my first job was actually building database software for storing semiconductor data and there used to be a job like that 89 because there was no professional databases at that time things like Oracle and MongoDB and SQL did not actually exist so we were still hand cobbling databases in those days. After a year I realized that that was not something I wanted to do so I looked around and found that I wanted really work for a database company and moved across the Bay to Berkeley to work for a company at that time called Sybase and when I was at Intel Intel I think 8 to 10,000 employees so my next job was with a company which had only 80 employees at that time. Accidentally without realizing I joined a startup and that was the good part. The bad part for those of you familiar with startups was we were in 1990 we were going through a bad recession in Silicon Valley and Sybase was not able to raise a round of funding so they had bridge capital when I joined and they just laid off 10% of their workforce and fortunately for me I was not savvy to any of these topics. I was very excited about living in Berkeley and working for a database technology that was really really sophisticated and sort of gave me the learning that I wanted to do and so what happened was within a year the recession turned around the company grew by the time I left it five years later we were 6,000 people we had filed, we had become public we were one of the top database companies and to me the moral of that story was really again around pursuing what you love and focus on when you sort of do things in a very calculated way and a top down way it may work out it may not work out. In this case I was just pursuing something that I wanted to do more from the perspective of what I loved and that is sort of how my entire career has shaped out including starting the two companies it hasn't mean oh I want to start a company in collaborative consumption or or something it's just sort of organically evolved in the process and so I was there at Sybase for a long time and then I realized that the company had become too big for me so then I joined another company called Versaara which had a couple of ex-cibase people and it had only eight employees at that time. Now we were in a completely different world in that company we were building applications for Microsoft platforms and this was 95 and the world was shifting towards the first wave of internet and at that point in time what ended up happening was that as the world was shifting towards internet we had to pivot and actually Professor Bias if he's in the room I was taking his class right before that time and learning about concepts called crossing the chasm focusing etc and as this new fight MBA this company I was trying to persuade the CEO to apply those concepts and was failing but ultimately some of those things helped me in a way because we had to put all of our energies and moving away from the Microsoft Windows platform and moving to internet back in 9899 so that that was sort of a time of I would call extreme learning where we were in a company that was going through a major what we would call pivot today where we had to actually go through firing off half the company to go through that pivot but then we grew from there and actually went public in 2000 and the company went from 8 to over 600 700 people and that was sort of my first state of success where I really was there from the beginning and grew the company but as I was exiting the company we hit the second recession in Silicon Valley which was around 0102 that I experienced where things were really bad this probably the worst I've seen in the 30 years in Silicon Valley and that allowed and forced us to all reinvent ourselves so I had to focus on reinventing myself from being an engineer and I actually took on the role of an investment banker at that point in time and what I was doing was really introducing companies together and through that process I was able to connect to companies that one company ended up acquiring another company and in that process it became a new company and invited me to join when I joined that company I realized that this area that specifically the working was not my passion so I took all of that and my wife is here and we took all of that and applied that passion into remodeling our home in that remodeling I discovered a lot of problems that they were around collaboration around shopping this was back in 2003 2004 and from there emerged by first company but as the idea was forming I kept telling myself you know I'm not the right guide to do this because I know everything about enterprise software building systems databases I know nothing about consumer behavior I know absolutely nothing about advertising I know nothing about collaborative models or web or internet from an outside and perspective so I kept rejecting the idea but progressively that idea became all consuming and it everything felt like a nail so it felt like I could solve world hunger with this little thing around social collaboration a tool that I was building which was called Kabudla at that point in time and part of what I did was and this is sort of high approach problems is creating the necessary preconditions for success and I would sort of again give you a piece of thought is that wherever you're going the young sort of the journey you're taking in terms of the schooling you're getting etc if a direction you want to get to trying to create the right preconditions for success is very important so for me that preconditions came by actually becoming a volunteer in several different local organizations and taking and focusing my energy in connecting with people who really know what internet was so I connected alums you know from iit from Berkeley etc and and brought them into sort of connection met with a couple of my professors were teaching you at Stanford a couple of guys who were involved in Google in the early days but also created a group of internet luminaries who were just starting out at that time so through that I met with read half-man Joe Krause bunch of people who I would not have met through in my normal sort of process brought them all together created a think tank which was good for them but I was also learning through that process and meeting folks and so that was sort of some of the preconditions I created before kaboodle was getting born as kaboodle started we really started in a garage physically in a garage and very soon we realized that the real true product market fit for that product was around women's shopping in women's community and so by honing it on that sort of very specific thing it was easy to find that market fit however when I went to my board my advisors everyone asked me a simple question which was how can shopping be social now you have to remember this was two thousand and five and I'm a 51-year-old man and at that time I was sitting in a room of 40-year-old men and for them shopping being social was very counterintuitive and so we had to take a risk to really move this thing in the world of social shopping as we were going from a general purpose collaboration tool fortunately we did and the market adoption and we made everything sort of public and super social this was circa 0506 even the term social shopping when we launched the product in 06 was counterintuitive we had to explain what is social shopping and remember going to tech crunch at Michael Aintens office and trying to explain to him what is social even mean in contact of shopping social was somewhat of a paradigm the social shopping was kind of an oxymoron in those days and and that's how sort of the caboodle journey began and the company sort of grew very fast in the first couple of years but it was still early days the monetization wasn't there and in 07 we were looking at two options we had a term sheet from soft bank and we had a acquisition offer from Hurst fortunately for us we actually ended up selling to Hurst at that point in time and became part of first magazines and heart interactive I say fortunately because after that 08 and 09 happened and 08 and 09 was another sort of recession fortunately this time I was sitting in a very different situation where we were actually scaling and growing very fast at that period of time and this journey of five or six years with caboodle became my how many of you have Malcolm Gladwell's 10,000 hours sort of metaphor so Malcolm Goudreth has this book where he talks a little bit about the fact that to really specialize or grow skills in some areas you have to spend at least 10,000 hours practicing it right and so through this five years this 10,000 hours that I spent in this journey transformed me from being just a database geek to now knowing about community fashion working with sort of a community which was predominantly women and then marrying technology and sort of these things together so as I came out of this company and finished my contract with Hurst I wanted to do something which mirrored these two things and the big insight I had was that when we think of really creating a shopping platform which is focused around discovery paradigms fashion style etc the scale that we'd been able to achieve in 2009, 2010 was very small and a lot of it was gated by the fact that people were really trying to do everything in a very structured algorithmic way and a lot of fashion and style is a sedentivity discovery so the first thesis we had going into this sort of whole problem was that we wanted to build something that was really powered by people and the second thing which was there which was happening in 2009 or 10 was iPhone was just starting to come off age and and I say iPhone because that was the only mobile product worth using at that time and so mobile was just starting to come off age and that really led to sort of the creation of poshmar and what sort of clicked in my mind was I was on a vacation and one of my friends had it iPhone 4 which was about this big but it was the first phone which had very high resolution camera and very high resolution screen and he was able to take a photo immediately uploaded to Facebook where I was with my SLR trying to take a photo get the chip out shove it into the laptop and try to get it in as it this is revolutionary right now and right on that time I discovered a little app called Instagram which had this notion of something called filters that said between these two things we've suddenly empowered the consumer to really create a dynamic fashion magazine and in 2009 when we had the early idea of poshmar we were thinking it'll be a set of fashion magazines that would connect people to buy and sell so in 10 with this platform it became clear that this may be the right way to think about it the challenge was the world was not ready for it none of the investors at that time really believed that mobile will be the place where people would shop so everyone was trying to convince me why don't you just use it as selling tool but really create a website around shopping and for me that felt very antithetical to sort of the whole circular paradigm so the one big bet we made which was sort of the insight was that everything will be done on this phone so we really focused on just one thing which was to build an end-to-end app around this area prior to sort of even starting poshmark one of the pre-conditions for starting poshmark was when we started kaboodle it was three guys all of us came from technology background because again my network were sort of confined to Silicon Valley so for poshmark or sort of for the next journey I said you know I have an amazing network of people from technology I understand product and all of that but I wanted to systematically bringing a partner a co-founder who came deep from fashion world and so I actually spent the first half of 2010 even before this epiphany around the phone happened really trying to figure out who that right founder would be and met actually several people who grew up in the fashion business in New York and LA who were here and finally met my co-founder Tracy through Mayfield who was one of the people who introduced me and connected to her and we really ended up sort of really sort of feeling compatible in terms of how our values were over our shared vision was about the future and then two of the other co-founders got them in Chathen in poshmark were actually with me in kaboodle days both were CTO and VP of engineering which is the role that they play here and that's how sort of the initial team for poshmark came together but there was a fifth missing piece because poshmark is very much powered around community and so to get that community element I actually went back to kaboodle and reconnected with the person who worked in a very different role with me in kaboodle and recruited her and she didn't even know that she was actually really good at it but I saw the potential in her to bring her on as our head of community and the five of us were able to start poshmark again back to the garage days initial funding came from Mayfield and bet sort of the farm on creating an end-to-end platform on that little device called iPhone 4 at that time now it seems like amazing sort of cell in deputy wise you know mobile should have meant everything in 2010 to the London if it's a huge risk in fact I remember going to at least a dozen different investors up and down Sandhill and everyone saying you know yeah we like it but the conversion rates are much higher on the web so you definitely launch a website we actually didn't launch a website till two years later and actually only beginning of last year did our website actually match up to industry standards and web is actually a growth engine for us in the last 18 months almost reverse because the first five years for all mobile for us the the beauty of that was that we built everything so everything happened on the phone which today people are trying to get to and we sort of started there and that ended up being a huge competitive advantage over the long term what I did not know which happened in the capital days but also happened in the poshmark days was as we were starting the company they were at least 70 to 80 other guys who were trying to do the same thing seven years later what's interesting about our space is not the fact that poshmark is growing and scaling and winning but that there is actually probably eight or ten other companies who are doing pretty well in this space and the whole space is actually very well formed at this point driving a lot of growth in how fashion is being bought and sold not just in the United States but across the world and that is something which I don't think I could have predicted even at that journey is how the entire sort of behavior of the consumer will massively shift however what we did from day one was put in a couple of core principles in place that have guided the growth of the platform and the first for for our business was really focusing on love by that what I mean is focusing on engagement and so if you're building anything in the consumer space I would say the number one thing to focus on is engagement even though everyone will tell you to focus on growth growth comes but engagement is something that is not easy to sort of get or invent so for us the very first one show of the product got the consumers very deeply engaged and that was an early sign of success where people were and are spending somewhere between 20 to 25 minutes a day on the app and they open the app seven to nine times a day and most people will activate as both buyer and seller which makes the process of building a marketplace much easier because you don't have to focus on supplier demand simultaneously so where we are today is we have little over 40 million community members growing at the rate of 40 50 percent a year in terms of sheer community they continue to remain engaged so every single user who's joined the platform continues to sort of scale up in its engagement and spend levels we have roughly about a hundred million dollars worth of inventory that's uploaded on a weekly basis what's really interesting is one of the architectures we created was mutual sharing of love so the platform is built around the fact that each user has to build a set of followers which is not encountered intuitive all of you you know because you're familiar with social platforms you have to build a set of followers what's counted intuitive is that all your items are primarily seen by just your followers so which means in order to grow your business you have to not just build a network of followers you have to engage with other people and what the follower sees is all the items that are being shared by the people that he or she is following so you have to actually share not just your own items but items that other people list in order to build your network so in that sense it behaves like a social network so probably the only marketplace where every seller spends roughly half their time promoting other seller's items now if you think about it for a second how counter intuitive is that how many people know a marketplace where every seller spends half their time promoting other sellers but they don't do it because they are just sort of in the world of being good to other people they do it because they also want to grow however this sort of this particular metaphor and by the way this metaphor was an accident in the sense that the curation was very deliberate to get people to curate each other's items but this interaction and engagement that observation only happened later on as to how it was facilitating as an extreme expediter of community development because you had to engage with other people and what that does is it allows us to continue to sort of build the system without having to do all kinds of retention and sort of proactively going out and other pieces now when you think about people sharing each other's items there is a wisdom into it because as you share other people's items you actually become more and more savvy as a stylist so we call our seller seller stylist also it prevents us from introducing things like advertising because we can't the main focus is around sharing so which keeps the core of the community very pure and so one of our first core values that we've created in the platform is all around putting the consumer first right so when you think about the seller and the buyer because they are the same and because they have to focus on other people and those people have to focus on other people the core of the community is centered around people so our entire shopping platform is not built on products but are focusing on people and I remember in 2010 standing in a cafe on university avenue and three or four of us were sitting there and we just had this epiphany that Boschmark is all about people and that is still true and we all give us each other a big hug because the entire product design centered around that sort of single concept of people what was beautiful is that it also allows us to design a company architecture so for example at Boschmark today everyone who joined in the first two and a half years of the company every single employee is still here with the company and they are still scaling and growing with the company many of them are senior executives many of them are leaders in the in the group but part of it is not just me putting people first but everyone sort of putting people first and that has created a culture which you know obviously takes a lot of effort and we are going through as we are scaling a different places to continue to challenge it but it creates an amazing culture which particularly when you live in Silicon Valley to have that longevity across all types of folks is very hard to do you can only do it if you can walk the walk and talk the talk and sort of render two things so it allows us to dovetail community and company paradigms into into a single sort of approach the second thing is we created a partnership with our community where we do not make any money off our community we only make money when our community makes money now think about that for a second if you are in the business of advertising you're actually asking people to pay something whether they make money or not if you have a service fee you're actually asking people to pay a service fee whether they make money or not right imagine if Stanford changes entire tuition system to say we'll only be taking 5% of your future earnings and nothing today right they would actually be in a different position it be a very radically different approach provided you signed up for it right so we did that from day one we said hey seller anybody who sells on the platform will have an 80-20 partnership with you you keep 80% of revenue we keep 20% and that's it there's going to be no other fees ever beyond that you never pay any payment processing fee any shipping fee any overweight fee any charge back fraud anything else no listing fees nothing so we did that in 2011 in 2018 we have the exact same fee structure if you think of seven years and any marketplace any single marketplace you can pick up if you look at the number of times they've changed the fees it would be at least 3 to 6 whether you think of Amazon eBay Etsy or any of the sort of marketplaces and part of the thing was it felt a little heavy early on that people said or 20% it's a lot but the reason we did that is we could provide every single service and never have to go back and touch that fee structure right so we could lead and focus on love and money comes and money is sort of always a second order process so we can focus on really delivering the highest value and that guides us from day one is we are in the service of our seller style of our community and we don't have to worry about anything else everything else just gets taken care of in the process so we always go with our community we cannot grow outside them because we don't make any money if they don't make any money we just recently announced we've distributed over a billion dollars to our seller style is distributed not just our revenue so it's excludes our fees and everything else and that is a great milestone because in their success lies our success and it never sort of disconnects ever at all the the third thing which is around this sort of love is very very critical because if you have that as a core thing then you can allow and scale the platform without having to corrupt it right and over time one of the challenges that happens is when those things become when love and money gets disconnected and you start to become a public company or whatever all these pressures start to take you down into dark alleys right and it's taken a lot of work upfront the first three four years for super hard but as you're scaling by coinciding these two pieces you can create something really early so my sort of core takeaway from this is as you go through your journeys in life you know obviously you're very young and as you sort of evolve as your own value systems get clearer think of how you can create products and services that can be meaningful have economically sound foundations so we didn't give away the product for free we charged 20% partnership but over the long term it becomes very symbiotic and synergistic with what you want to do right and that you're clarifying around what your value systems are what you're trying to do is very very powerful but then being able to build products and services that you can symbolize is even more critical and particularly with the amazing opportunity that all of you have and the amazing opportunities that this valley gives you in terms of growth I think the responsibility that we have to society is at an all-time high right and so we have to be able to level up to that responsibility and combine it and integrate with all the amazing opportunity and successes that all of you are going to achieve and so one of the beautiful parts of working at Poshmark is that every day we get to see the success of over 10 million people who are actively selling and buying on the platform and continue scale and we have women who have gone from sort of starting from their closet and now running million dollar businesses managing three or four patch of months entirely on Poshmark we've heard stories of people escaping abusive relationships using Poshmark we've heard people who have started again and built you know a multi sort of city group and then of course connections so that is fantastic and the fact that we don't have to go and give them another tax bill at the end of the day is very very nice because they can continue to scale their business around Poshmark and so that focus is being the K the final thing I'm going to leave with you which is a super important thing is each of you is weird who doesn't feel that they're or who feel that they're weird right starting from intel and doing helping women's health shoes definitely weird right but there's many other weirdness as I can talk about I'll tell you one thing else is that the very first year arrived in this country I was actually nine months later performing on the steps of the Texas State Capitol a Mexican folk dance being part of the Mexican folk dancing group so totally embrace your weirdness and in your weirdness you're also embracing everyone else's weirdness and that's the power the power is not about you it's really about accepting everyone else for who they are and in that process you can create something much more robust so when you think about community and think of the products they sell and there's many platforms out there one of the biggest things for us is that fashion is universal so there's no restriction to what you can sell on Poshmark you can sell your five dollar shirts and you can sell your five thousand dollar handbag you can sell something new you can sell something old you can sell high and low end and really by embracing everyone what it does is creates much more robust of a system and you'd be surprised even if you look around and you look at your closet or around what you find is that people have all kinds of mixed shirts and they actually go through all kinds of journeys and by bringing it all together and figuring out a way to have them all work together it's become so much more robust than if we created a platform only for a certain kind of product whether it was luxury or street or something and now we can actually start to broaden up and embrace all other kinds of weirdnesses similarly in our company when I look around and we look at different people we have PhDs we have folks from Ivy Leaks and we have college dropouts and they're all in senior positions in different kinds of senior positions because we want to and embrace it all and you're working hard I mean I wouldn't say that we are all completely diverse we have to work more on that diversity within the company but the key and the mindset is open so that and through that you can create a lot more robustness so by embracing your weirdness I would really urge you to embrace the weirdness of all of the others and through that I think you can create something much much more robust thank you now open it up for questions and then oh chair any questions how hard work was for you to embrace a weirdness you were going up or when when you were trying to enter the world so yeah yeah the question is how hard was it for me to embrace my weirdness I was growing up I would say that it's a progressive journey right you know when you are sort of young and particularly when I was you know staying at home I was a teenager and teenage is probably an age where you're trying to fit in so over time you get more confident but I would say that because of the fact that we had to move around so much I felt like there was just a lot of life experiences that I was exposed to which allowed me to create a broader mindset and sort of more acceptance so for example I grew up in a family which was vegetarian however the first set of meats I ate were hunted meats which in India is kind of awkward and weird to think about but that has opened up my palate which I realized now 50 years later that I can eat almost anything with anybody so that's been much more embracing of my weirdness but it was created because of this openness that was there so if you talked about prioritizing like engagement or growth right um if you think about the fight outside the mobile application space and it's so like happen I think it would so the question is I talk about prioritizing engagement over growth does it apply beyond mobile applications I think it applies to really any kind of consumer experience for sure potentially enterprise experience but you know I'll speak from a consumer experience if you're building something small let's see you're building a coffee shop if you can figure out how your customer loves that coffee shop repeatedly then you can build thousands of them but if you haven't figured out that deep love in connection with that customer it's much harder to scale and the thing is that that love in customers so you can get capital and you know open up 10 coffee shops but everyone has the same crappy engagement at some point your business will stop growing so so that's why I believe that when you're trying to get that genuine connection enterprise is just a little bit different because you can go through that iteration process and sort of scale at the same time but in consumer either consumer is connected to your product at a deep level or not and if you haven't gotten that and you grow then I think you're growing on very weak foundation and ultimately the chances of faltering are high how are you able to push through like the thing that you wanted to do when you didn't know that the phone like everything was going to be a phone how are you able to focus and be determined when like in 206 you said like nobody knew that the phone was going to be everything so how were you able to push your company through the question is how was I able to sort of push the company through and and and sort of get the determination that the phone was real so I actually did an experiment so once I discovered that this phone thing was happening I gave up my laptop and spend the next several months just working off of my phone and an iPad which in 2010 was an incredibly hard thing to do I was trying to do PowerPoint on it excel on it there was no native applications and the form factor was this this big so I did that for several months it was painful but I felt like you could do that right and so that proved to me that this platform which was sort of still embryonic if it was this productive and this sort of portable that there's a probability that this thing is likely to succeed the second thing was actually what one of my mentor said which is you know as entrepreneurs we have this syndrome he calls it the Yahoo syndrome the entrepreneur's name is Kanvalgeri and called the Yahoo syndrome I don't know if you've read about it but it's called yet another effing opportunity syndrome right and what ends up happening is that when you get an idea and you see its application see it can be applied here you can be applied here it can be applied here I can do it this and if I don't do this somebody else will do this and so after while you feel like you have to do everything simultaneously and most great ideas die not because they're not great ideas but because you diversify and sort of broaden out very quickly Professor Byers you know taught me about crossing the castle which is about narrow focus and and crossing something with a lot of force around it so once I nail down this focus on phone I knew I only wanted to focus on that one thing because building for it will be so hard that diffusing it will actually bifurcate the team bifurcate the resource and bifurcate the energy so the combination of those two things allowed me to build the conviction to go down that path you're always scared and and so the question was were you scared you're always scared the so here's another thing is being a first time entrepreneur you're very very scared and everyone tells you are wrong and I don't know if you've heard the story of Emperor Isnaked who's heard the story right so you know a lot of times when you're sort of doing that first company everyone tells you are wrong so you are really getting the feedback that you're wrong you're wrong so you don't have to worry about being scared or being wrong when you're a second time entrepreneur and you've had even a moderate for success a lot of time people fail and so again creating the preconditions will access for a second time entrepreneur one of the biggest feedback I got was that to succeed the second time you have to have beginners mind you have to sort of surround yourself with people who'll tell you that you are screwed up right and so actually spend a fair bit of time building a different kind of circle in the second time where there were a lot of people who could challenge me who could kick me and and give me the fear because you do get a sense of confidence when you've succeeded in moderately right and so that was very helpful in the early days and then there's obviously new kinds of problems that happen in the second journey so that creates its own fear. So this is the opposite kind of question so if you had heard you know the 80 people that were working on the same thing you were working on how would you have a packet of your perception of your idea I guess would you have to give it up for something where you make or just you have worked on it. So the question is had I known there were 80 other people working on the idea what would I have done and I think that was probably the part where my confidence from the first time played better in the second time. So the first time I was hyper focused on competition and actually made a lot of mistakes by adding things in response to competition because even the first journey in the Kabudu journey we had 60-70 people who jumped in and you know there's a lot of PR that happens depending on your funding levels who's starting it and you get very responsive to that so if you like oh my god this person is rising I have to respond to it Yahoo is reading product Google's reading so in the second journey what I realized that most of my mistakes in the first journey came from paying too much attention to the outside. So one of the sort of byproducts of this value embrace your weirdness is also around that if you look at great journeys and sort of great sort of evolution revolution you have to focus on your own strengths and so I don't think it would have impacted me but it didn't impact me in fact later on as competitive products have come they were pressured from investors even for the team let's let's morph in this direction or add that things and I have been sort of very focused and so is my team especially the core team to focus on our journey and so I would say you know especially in a competitive environment instead of looking around if you sort of figure out who you are and pursue that journey the thing is there's so much out there that it isn't about it isn't the zero sum game and particularly in the business we are in it's an infinite time it isn't a zero sum game so by sort of focusing on your own value you can create a journey of success which you won't by constantly looking around which is not to say you shouldn't pay attention to great things that are happening around you you shouldn't pay attention to the great innovation that's happening around you but instead of being scared about it figure out your strengths rather than chasing it regarding the product I read that you offered like free of indication how do you guarantee the application when you work in with thousands of brands what's the process so the question is we offer free authentication for certain kinds of products which means that we verify that this is an authentic Louis Vuitton or Chanel and how do you guarantee that with thousands of products so really at that price point the number of brands actually narrows down and we have a pretty savvy team focused on a certain selection of brands plus we partner up with a network of virtual authentication for specific things if you hit for example a 60s or a 70s Chanel bag or a supreme jacket that was made in the 90s you have to then go to specialise that we can connect with and bring them on or we may have a native specialist so yes there is no there is a set of science but then there's a set of art and then there's a resources and you have to combine all of them to offer that service. I'm pretty sure you've failed at many points so what was a big failure and what did you learn? The question is you've probably failed at many points in times what's a big failure and what do you've learned from it? There's many different failures I think there's two times that I can share one was at Caboodle when we were just starting to scale we got so caught up in our early sort of success that we had that I ended up going out and partnering with everybody who was coming in our direction so I ended up creating a partnership with eBay with a group called Condonass that some of you may know they make magazines like Vogue and others we were about to do a partnership with the business week in McGraw Hill if I'd done that partnership the company would have died right and so part of the challenge was in the cockiness and ego of sort of early success we thought we could do it all and that I would say is probably the biggest thing is that my flaw or sort of my challenges have all come from becoming too egotistical or too cocky they've never come from sort of fear right and so I have to keep an eye on it and sort of surround myself with people who are kicking me in the butt and telling me I'm wrong. I had a question on how you developed your career early at the computers even with sites like Get zero. That's a great question the question is how did we build our early group of users and I think for us it was a very organic process so what we did was we when we started the product development process we actually got an early build out within three months of starting our product development into the hands of the few users so early on the users were friends of our community their friends of few people that they'd met and we hosted a small event at a boutique and that's how we got some of our early users and then we had our community leader Leanne Tracy me and one other person and we would just go out to events and try to recruit people local people remote people and the idea was to funnel them into a weekly meetup that we would do at a wine bar in San Francisco and the goal was to get them there now one of the funny things was in 2011 most people actually didn't have a smartphone so they didn't have an iPhone or an Android device so we had to actually go out and buy a hundred iPhone iPod videos which was the model equivalent of an iPhone and have that with us which we gave to people on loaner most of them didn't come back but that was our gift to them in terms of their testing so that's how sort of the early community form we would meet with them every week early on we didn't have transactional processes so so Leanne would actually send out emails and say hey you need to pay $30 this person you pay $20 to this where they met a district wine bar they would actually exchange bags and exchange money but the serendipity of it was that the number of people who joined the activation rates and engagement rates were over 80 percent so it was foundationally very built on deep engagement and that's sort of how the early community started then when we launched the app formally in late 11 early 12 again there was no mobile distribution engines out there some of the stuff you see which allows business to scale very fast none of that was there and whatever there was extremely expensive like 35 to a hundred dollars a user which was not something we could afford so what we did was we actually started to throw small physical events in cities we went to LA we went to San Antonio we went to Austin and through these small events partnering up with two three users we had there inviting some of the local fashion bloggers and those events ended up again creating small groups of users but deeply engaged and that's how we built our first five or ten thousand users before we got real mobile engines to scale the business so it was hard work I mean I would say in the first 18 months of our app we had only five to ten thousand users but each of them was so passionate that I remember in May of 12 when we were going to change our shipping rates with a five or ten thousand registered users but we got 200 emails protesting it shops that explicitly sell through your pack marks like users that have made their own business the question is are their users only exclusively sell through through Pashmart absolutely we actually have many people who have not just were not just selling through Pashmart but have sort of risen up the in the fashion chain where they've created fashion brands and we have a wholesale engine where they distribute those fashion brands to other sellers who also sell it on Pashmart so they have their own brand they have a brand that they sell through other sellers and they also then have maybe 200 300 sellers selling on their behalf so they're becoming like many fashion moguls where they have their own boutiques they have proprietary direct to consumer and some of them now have three or four different brands you know some focused on plus size some on jewelry and I expect you know we just know that we hit one of the first million dollar a year kind of a seller who's doing it both directly and through these brands and I expect we'll start to see ten twenty fifty million dollar many fashion and beauty moguls who are sort of being created on the platform in the near future the entrepreneurial thought leader series is a Stanford e-corner original production supported by the venture capital firm DFJ the stories and lessons on Stanford e-corner are designed to help you find the courage and clarity to see and see these opportunities Stanford e-corner is led by the Stanford Technology Ventures program and Stanford's Department of Management Science and Engineering to learn more please visit us at e-corner.stanford.edu
