 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Today it is my incredible pleasure to introduce our special guests. We have four recent alumni who come from our fellowship programs. They are all involved with very interesting entrepreneurial ventures. They have been invited to participate with us because of the diversity of what they are doing and the passion that they bring to these projects. We have Cody Karutz, who is a DFJ Entrepreneur Leader. He graduated just last year. We have Elaine Chung, who was a Mayfield Fellow a few years ago. What did you graduate? I am not a recent graduate. A few years ago. Class of 1999. 1999. We have Tasha Cave. She was an Excel Innovation Scholar. What year did you graduate? Officially last year. Last year, I turned my thesis. And Joan Agreenberger, who is also a Mayfield Fellow. Please join me in welcoming our special guests. So I thought that it would be really helpful to have each of them introduce themselves. Just get a little bit about their background, what they studied and what they are doing now to set the stage. So who wants to start? Cody? Yeah, I'm Cody. I studied symbolic systems. I'm Cody. I studied symbolic systems here. I graduated in June and now I work as Head of Creative at Striver Labs, which is a performance training virtual reality startup that came out of research here at Stanford. Hi, my name is Elaine Chung. I did my undergrad here at Stanford in biological sciences and then I did my co-term in MSNE in the steam of engine. I was a Mayfield Fellow's program as well. I'm at a company called Grail and what we're trying to do is analyze circulating nucleic acid in the blood in order to try to be able to detect cancer early. I am Tasha Cave and I did my Masters in PhD here. I was in the Mechanical Engineering Department. However, my advisor was in chemical engineering. And while I was here, I participated in the Excel Scholars Program. I also did Ignite, the summer program in the GSB. We also were in the Stanford Venture Studio. We did StarDec. So, I've done a lot of entrepreneurship things here at Stanford. And the company that we started, two of the co-founders who also were Stanford Gras. We started a company called Opus 12. And what Opus 12 does is recycle CO2. So we make reactors that input carbon dioxide and water. And then using metal catalysts and electricity, we break down the CO2 and wall on through smaller atomic bits and then reform those atomic bits into a new molecule. And we can make one of 16 new molecules out of just CO2 and water. And these include things like a precursor to the diesel fuel, to plastics, common household chemicals. And the idea is that we can provide an economic incentive for companies to utilize their CO2 instead of just throwing it away. Awesome. Jonah Greenberger, I was a Stanford Class of 08. I don't know if classes do that anymore. The little 08 chant. But I started a company called Bright two and a half years ago. And we provide cheaper electricity to homes in developing countries with rooftop solar subscriptions. So pretty impressive, right? So I got a lot of students come to me recently. It must be that time of years. The students are thinking of graduating at the end of this year and thinking about what they're going to do next. And they're trying to figure out what drives them. And it would be really helpful to know from you guys what motivated you to get involved with the endeavors that you're working on now. Means that, for example, Cody, this is right out of school, as for you, Tasha. Yeah. Yeah, for me, I really found myself in a place where there was an identifiable use case for the virtual reality industry. I happened to be studying VR at a time where it was exploding, so a little bit before what we see now. And another student here at Stanford came to me and had this really great idea, which was the first time that I thought there was an actual real quality use case for VR. And this was kind of before the explosion in the industry. So what motivated me was just being excited about a use case that I thought was a tremendous application. Great. And Tasha, you also started right after school. Yeah, and actually, we started a little bit before I graduated. We were working in our free time before I finished to figure out what we're going to do for the company, how we're going to make this economically viable. And for me, it really just was I was doing this research here. I loved it. It gave me a huge sense of purpose, and I really want to see if it could work in the real world. So my other co-founder, Kendra, we did our PhD together. We were in the same lab. We just started writing down ideas of how we could actually scale up the technology. Because my PhD was mostly focused on the basic science side. So we wrote papers, and we looked at things on a very fundamental level. And this is kind of the other side of that, of the applied side, of how do you make it cheaper and more cost effective, and how do you make the economics work? So I really just stand for interest in wanting to do the technology, not seeing anyone in the Bay Area or in the side of the country that had worked in this area. And so we thought, well, if not us, then who? Why don't we just see if we can make this work? So that was two and a half years ago. So it's really interesting because, Jonay and Elaine, you have a really different story. I believe Jonay, you had a passion for doing something meaningful in the solar space, but you made a really different decision about how to go about it first. Yeah, so you kind of led me into this. So energy is an interesting field. You need some industry experience. It's like a very global industry with a lot of regulations. So I actually, when I was graduating, I did the Mayfield Fellows Program, and then I decided to go to the largest company I could to learn about business. And I had studied mechanical engineering. So I went to Chevron, which was doing some interesting stuff in clean tech. And I went there to learn the processes that make a company tick at scale and what regulation work and what makes the company successful in the energy industry. And I was there for longer than I thought. I was there for about five years, but I learned a ton and then started bright right after that. And one of the reasons actually was, this is kind of a more big quote, but I think on people's deathbed, the number one thing they regret is not taking a risk. And so I read that once and it kind of haunted me. And I was at Chevron and it was haunting me. And once I felt like I'd been there and I started to get enough courage, I just decided that I didn't want to be that person on my deathbed that had not taken a risk and did what I wanted to do. So that's kind of how the soil started. Great. Yeah, so similar to the energy industry, which takes a lot of capital is highly regulated. It's been my passion since I was a kid to be in the life sciences industry. So after school, a couple of the opportunities that I went to were being the industry leader for molecular diagnostics in oncology to help cancer patients guide their treatment decisions and then went to the industry leader in DNA sequencing technologies. And spent several years at both of those organizations kind of learning the space and really learning the domain. And but wanted to get back to an or more kind of start up opportunity where I could be very close to developing products for the patients. And so really, Grail is an opportunity for us to do that to leverage really, really exciting technologies to be able to improve patient lives. So we know that starting a company or being involved with the start up is full of surprises and often, you know, pits that you fall into as well as really fabulous highs. How there been already some surprises that you could share with us, you know, obviously you started with the idea that, okay, this is going to be fabulous and great. But what happened that might have surprised you along the way? How do you want to start? Yeah, for us. We're surprised that so we build a training tool for professional athletes to use VR to train. And we're always surprised that coaches don't want to use the tool. I think the biggest surprise for me is how important sales is to our cycle is to actually try to sell this tool because to us, I mean, we are a company of athletes and sports-minded folk. But the sales process is so important to the industry. And I think the biggest surprise was just how hard we need to work at that. So instead of proving it as a tool, it's always about kind of pitching it to kind of how do they use it in a way that is effective for them and how do we pitch it to them as something that's going to be non-invasive to their current coaching philosophies? So interesting. You sort of thought if we build that they will come. Exactly. You learned that that was certainly not the case. Not the case. Yes, so we're still working on that. Okay, great. Elaine. Thanks. I think generally speaking, the genomics industry and the technology that's been developing over the last decade has been moving extraordinarily quickly. The cost per sequencing and base pair is dropping much, much faster than Moore's law. Exponential a faster, in fact. And so it's really enabled this technology to be applied in a clinical setting now very rapidly. So I think at a meta level, that's been a surprise to all of us in terms of how quickly that technology has developed. But I think for us at the start-up, we're a very mission-driven company. And so the rate at which we've been growing, but we have a company value of GSD, which is get stuff done. It's just been a phenomenal experience over the last several months to see how much a group of really smart, like-minded mission-driven folks can get done. And so as an example, we brought on our first wave of hires in March. And by August, we had already started enrolling in our first clinical trial, which will end up enrolling over 10,000 subjects. And just the pace at which that has happened is pretty unprecedented in the oncology space. And so that's been a very pleasing surprise for all of us. Great, so a good surprise. Yeah, I think for me, the big surprise was, you know, we were first starting this and kind of working in the evenings, figuring things out. I sort of naively thought that, oh, we're three Stanford students. We have two technical co-founders and one business co-founder. And someone will give us an initial amount of money to get out there and get going. And then the later stage funding would be the harder part. The first funding would be really easy. And that turned out to not be the case at all. No one really wanted to give us any money because we had no prototype. We just had an idea and had a decent story. And so what we had to do was end up getting government funding to build our initial prototype. And in general, we've had to diversify the streams in which we've raised money. So we've also looked at philanthropy and family offices and kind of to get us to the stage where we would be attractive to venture funding at a later point. We're still not there yet. We're bringing in angel investors and that type of thing, but we're not quite ready for venture capital funding. And so that has been the most surprising part of like you hear all these stories about, oh, you know, a couple of students got their initial seed funding right out of school and then could take off and that for a clean tech company and doing hardware, that's not the case. So I was surprised by how many people will tell you that you can't do it. I, when I started Bright, so I wasn't fluent in Spanish. I still am not in our first market in Mexico. So there were some things that just didn't make sense. And I knew that, but I also was very surprised that so many people said that just doesn't make sense. Like you can't start in a country you've never been to that you have no connections to and you can't speak the language. And it was like the nose and like, what are you doing? You're crazy with come from everywhere. Like I think there was like maybe 5% of the people I talked to that were like really supportive and like this is a great idea. But it's kind of like, I don't know of anyone who here is like signed up for a race that they thought was like a crazy race, but then because they signed up they just did it. Like that's how it works. And it's kind of the same with entrepreneurship and startups. You kind of just have to sign up, like make the leap. And then on the opposite side of the coin, I was surprised by how much you can figure out if you just do that. I actually, I flew to Mexico for the first time when I was starting Bright and the power of the Stanford network, I reached out to Stanford alumni in Mexico and someone I had never met, I ended up staying with and my flight was late. So I ended up getting there at midnight. He was asleep. It was a very awkward interaction when I was blowing up the air mattress to sleep on his floor. And that's like, it's a crazy start, but like that started. That was my first connection in Mexico and then it just grew from there. And yeah, it was crazy and it didn't make any sense. But kind of signing up for it is like the most important step that you can take. And you'll test your limits, but you will succeed far more than you think you're capable of. And it'll only happen if you sign up. So it's so fascinating that there were so many people saying, oh no, this isn't going to work. Who did you go to for helpful advice? So we'll go back and distract you, but start off please. Yes, start it. Who is most helpful? Who do you go to for guidance? Yeah, so I think the two people that were most helpful, one was my dad, who had no idea what I was doing, didn't understand it. But it was our first check. Because he, it was funny because afterwards, I thought I pitched it really well. But afterwards, he, like a month later, my parents were like, sweet, so what are you doing again? That's great. This is like unconditional support. And he's a big fan of Jeff Bezos. And Jeff Bezos' first check was his parents. And he kind of wanted to do the same to me and just kind of believed in me. And so that belief was like, very helpful, because I didn't want to let him down. And then the other was one of my close friends, Matt Wall, who's the same year at me at Stanford. And kind of also just had this unwavering belief in me. And like, objectively what I was doing was crazy, but he knew and said, I have like, I want to write a check. Like, I don't care. I know you can do it. And it was like more belief than I had in myself. And that was pretty incredible and inspiring and made me push forward, because I didn't want to let them down. That's great. Yeah, I've definitely found mentors and allies in various places. So I would say the first mentor we had was Brian Bartholomew, who's here in the Tomcat Center. So Tomcat was actually our first grant that we got in and Tomcat gives grants to Stanford students and professors to transfer technology out of the lab. And so I remember sitting right there in Copacafay talking with Brian about like, oh, we're thinking about doing this. We don't know for too earlier. What do you think? And he just really encouraged us to go out there and just try it. And subsequently, we've gotten into several incubators and accelerators. And that has brought about mentors to us as well. And that has been huge. I mean, I think if you're doing a startup, especially in a challenging space, such as Clean Tech, you definitely need support. And really, if you don't need any industry, you really need support. And I have the ecosystem around you. And one plug for Excel scholars. So actually, our first angel investor in came through someone I knew in the Excel program. So having that network and stuff was really helpful. And once we got our first angel investor in, it just helped to bring others along. So definitely, why you're here now reach out, establish a network. Find out who your allies are going to be, people who believe in your idea and believe in you as entrepreneurs. And they'll be very helpful along the way to kind of keep you going. So we're lying. Yeah, same here. You know, I have had many, many bumps along the road. And some of them are really big. You know, is this company's sort of fundamental thesis flawed all the way to interpersonal conflict. You know, and all of those are very challenging. And similar to Jonah and Tosh have been saying, who I go to guidance for is, you know, definitely my dad. So just having that unwavering support and that unconditional, you know, perspective has been hugely valuable. But I've also built up a network of longstanding and deeply trusted friends and colleagues and advisors professionally. And the ones who have helped the most are those who have that clear right view of, you know, what is the right outcome? How do you get to that right outcome? And this feeling of empowerment and optimism that I can get there. And so that's always been an incredible resource. Great. Yeah, I think my time here at Stanford was, was valuable in the sense that I get to build kind of a social support network, which was probably the thing that they got me through, definitely my program, but also doing my program while doing the startup too. So I was lucky enough to actually take my favorite class here, CS 210. And so during 210, you get to form kind of a pretty close relationship with the other teammates. We actually had a VR related team. And so I got pretty close with my teammates then. And they're the ones that that I really got to turn to for social support when things got pretty difficult when we're going through our kind of early stage of VR turns. So it was great to kind of have them and to turn to them when I needed them. So you're all at the beginning of these ventures. And you're talking about these pitfalls, but I'm sure you have some big goal of what success looks like. Because obviously you're putting all this effort in. Anyone can jump in first. What does success look like for you? When will you know when you've gotten there? I would answer it a little bit differently. I don't think the journey is so hard to be honest that you can't just be looking for one moment in time where you say, like, I've done it. I'm successful. I think a lot of CEOs will tell you the moment they IPO, that's when they think, you know, they really feel it. And I think that's true. I think it's a great moment, but then it's done. And then like, what's next? So I think like really to get through all of the hard times, because it will be very hard, you have to enjoy like every moment of it every day and all of the struggles. You have to want that after like believe in what you're doing and enjoy the process. And so I'd say like, yeah, there are very hard times, but you know, every day I'd say like, you want to make sure you're successful that day. And that's that's what we'll push you forward. And don't I wouldn't I wouldn't try to like look for one moment in time and just aspire to that. Because that may not get you through all the really tough times. So what was your goal today? My goal today is to inspire lots of Stanford students to go out there and start awesome companies and not worry about how many people tell you that you can't do it. But just if you want to do it, go for it. And what you end up doing will probably be very different than what you started doing. But that's fine and that's important and that's how it should be. Who else wants to jump in? I think for us success is very clear. What we're really trying to do is change the paradigm for how cancer is detected. So through that journey, we are building, actually we've already built what will be the largest sequencing facility in the world by the amount of throughput. We're putting together the largest clinical trials that have ever been conducted in the history of medicine and building an incredible team with disparate skill sets that have not come together very frequently before. And what we're trying to do is really find cancer early when it's cured. When you can find cancer early in the stage one or two phase of the disease, it's possible to cure it by surgery and radiation. Most cancers are detected late stage. So at that point, it's typically palliative and it's really not curable. And so what we're trying to do is entirely shift the paradigm of how cancer is screened for. And so you can imagine going eventually to your annual checkup and having a tube of blood drawn. And through an analysis of that blood, be able to tell, do you have cancer? Yes or no? And if so, where is it in the body? Is it at a point in time when it can be locally treated? Yeah, so I would say at Opus 12, we seek to make CO2 great again. We defy this as bigly. We are going to build a company. It's going to be the greatest company. Fever. No, I mean, for me, the ultimate success is actually 10% reduction in greenhouse gas is globally by 2030. That's kind of my big vision. I mean, clear, there's like smaller goals in between there. I mean, we need to prove our technology. We have to do risk it. We need to show that we can run stably for a thousand hours and then five thousand hours. We need to prove out the market. We have an initial market that we're going after, which is a smaller market where we're producing chemicals for small chemical manufacturers. And then we have our larger market where we want to produce cost-competitive CO2 neutral fuels. So we have many goals on the way, but what keeps me going and what I'm in this forest to make the ultimate impact of making a dent in the amount of CO2 that's in the atmosphere. There might be more profitable opportunities in kind of smaller markets, but for me, what drives me is impact. I really want to build this company to make an impact on climate change. So that's how we set our goals. Yeah, for us success, we hope is already happening, which test means better decision-making. So for professional athletes, we are targeting being on the field and being able to practice as well off the field. So using virtual reality to potentially even do things like reduce injuries. So for us, being able to kind of replicate that sense of, I can mentally practice in a similar way and not have to put my body at a physical risk to do so. To us, that's the dream is to reduce that risk of injury for athletes and potentially have to be able to reduce practice time and help those athletes make better decisions off the field. So I know all of you well and I know that you've all had opportunities to do case studies in the classroom where you're being given some interesting strategic decisions you have to make. And so you had some practice sort of in a classroom setting, what sort of strategic decisions have you had to make that have been really pivotal for your ventures so far? Yeah, so I can start off. So when we first started the company, we were looking at making ethanol out of CO2. And the reason being was that we found this huge value proposition. So 10% of what you put in your car now is ethanol. And that ethanol comes from corn ethanol. And in the process of making corn ethanol, for every ton of ethanol they make, they emit a ton of CO2. So we could take their CO2 and make more ethanol and increase CO by 50%. It's a fuel so we can make this huge impact. And so we went down this road of making ethanol and refining our process where we can make it cost competitively. And then a few things happen with one, the oil and gas prices dropped and so it became harder and harder for us to be cost competitive in that market. And also it's a really huge market for us to kind of prove out our technology. We have to be at a really large scale. So we ended up changing our first product and now we make carbon monoxide for a small chemical manufacturer to use CO. And there's a non-trivial number of small chemical manufacturers who need carbon monoxide in their processes, pharmaceuticals for example. And that market is much smaller. We can produce smaller reactors so we can show our technology works in this small market. We can also be extremely cost competitive. We have a 10x cost advantage in this market for making on-site carbon monoxide for these customers. And it ended up allowing us to not have to wait until we could be at this massive scale in order to show our technology. And it ended up being a really great decision. We were able to get a lot more buy-in from angel investors and other people who were looking at our company. They saw that we could bring in revenue pretty early while we're testing the technology. And then we could use some of that revenue to get to our larger goal. So it was a really nice decision for us at least it has been at the moment. We'll see how it pans out. Great. I think the most strategic decision we made or I made was who to partner with on the company. I started it without a partner and it had ever been in Mexico. And so I was like, I needed to be very introspective and look at what was I good at? What was I not good at? We really didn't have a lot of domain expertise in Mexico. Didn't know how to navigate the local landscape. So I knew I needed someone in country to co-found the company with but I'd never worked. I was in a class with someone who had, I worked closely with and that was a great fit. And so I worked for like nine months with a couple of different folks and just saw how it worked out. And some of you may know that co-founder break up so the number one reason startups fail. So this was a huge decision. I made the wrong decision at first and then ended up firing a co-founder, although we didn't make it official and like that step of messy stuff definitely happens. But since then the person we did bring on as a co-founder, Pablo Costiano has been incredible. And like the only reason we've gotten this far, everything kind of comes from your team, especially your early team. So that was by far the most strategic decision and I didn't make it right away. I just needed more information and kept playing forward. Our biggest strategic decision was from the beginning to decide what types of athletes we wanted to work with. So for us this was research that we started with the Stanford Cardinal here with the football team. So we worked with David Shaw and Kevin Hogan and for us we wanted to decide do we go to a higher level first or do we start lower. So do we start with high school athletes first or do we start at the NFL level in which direction do we go from there? Do we work from the bottom up or go from the top down and for us we luckily landed the Dallas Cowboys as our first client and that kind of decided which direction we were going to go. So we started with the NFL first and we're working our way down to high school now. In many ways the formation of Grail, my company is the solution to a strategic problem that arose in and let me explain why. So Grail was spun out of a company called Illumina which is the industry leader of nucleic acid sequencing technologies and the strategic problem that needed to be solved for is that when you are a large profitable platform based company and your technology is rapidly becoming commoditized because what you're doing you're so good at what you're doing. Then the question shifts to how do you participate further down the value chain? How do you develop applications for that technology? And oftentimes it's very, very challenging for technology companies to be able to do that. It means a different type of investment and commitment. It means a different kind of mindset. It's a different culture. It's a different skill set to be able to do that. And so at Illumina you know it really grapples with a strategic question of how do we continue to drive the engineering revs on our technology but also be able to participate in the amplification and the ubiquitous adoption of this technology in higher value applications. And so ultimately the decision was to create something like Grail where you spin it out as an independent entity and you give it the kind of talent and the kind of resources and the kind of commitment and attention that it needs to be able to be successful. If you try to do that within a large profitable company that's looking at its EPS the company becomes it's a frantic almost and so it can't be solved for. So in many ways our startup is a solution to a strategic problem that arose out of the parent company. So Elaine you mentioned you needed the appropriate culture to drive this type of technology. I'd love to hear from all of you about whether you think about building the culture of your organizations. What kind of culture you want to build and what you might be doing to reinforce that. Do you want to start? Sure. So fundamentally the difference between a tools company and what we're trying to do is the difference between a very rapidly evolving technology and engineering mindset to something that's very clinically oriented. How do you develop clinical evidence and the data that a physician can use when they're sitting across the table from a patient in terms of how to help manage that patient's treatment. So that's a very different starting point already culturally. In terms of the culture that we're trying to build within the organization, I like I said before it's very mission driven and I think because we're building we're bringing together skill sets that have typically not been put together before communication and transparency. You know conveying that mission is absolutely essential for breaking down the silos. And I think it's a constant it's a constant effort. I mean that's actually one surprise is how hard it is to establish and maintain culture because if you really want a tight weave within an organization in a culture that binds everyone together, you know those kinds of you know it's a real challenge. So I hope we're you know continuing to do that. Great. Who else? Okay. Yeah I think about cultural a lot because even when I was here at Stanford, I was one of the things I really loved about my lab is that we really had a great culture there. I mean we worked really well as a team. People had their own kind of task in their projects but everyone would help each other. So I really want to make sure that was created at work because it's just it's not fun if you're working in a place that you don't enjoy, you know, enjoy working with the people you're with. So what we've done and the company as well as what we did here at Stanford was use a lot of beer. So we had a lot of lab socials. We go out every other Friday and we go get drinks, lunch on the company. We have group lunches, those own involved beer just because we we work at a national lab and they don't allow drinking at government facilities. But it's even though it seems pretty small it's been really helpful for creating this sense of camaraderie and like people feel really comfortable asking other people for help and working together as a team. One thing I've also done lately is do one-on-ones with each employee. We only have four so it's been easy to kind of spread them out. And I think that's been really helpful like understanding any issues the employees having. They offer suggestions on how to improve the culture and to improve the workflow of what we do in the company and most of their suggestions we've implemented. And so I think that creates a sense of listening to what they think and what they care about and we implement the ideas. And we've become more efficient to the company and working together. We've implemented some really great workflow tools. Our company culture is actually probably defined by a staffing decision we had to make very early on which is that a couple years ago in order to execute the VR pipeline as we needed to it was still fairly technical so we had a choice we could either hire engineers and teach them how to language of football and put them on football fields or we could go the other route which is we took people that knew football and we could teach them to do the engineering. We decided to go that route which meant that for a long time I was teaching recently released NFL linebackers how to do basic computer skills and to teach them to do some of the engineering skills that we needed which definitely made me a much more patient person and involved a lot of extensive professional development but I think it was great for us and that we decided and we knew that the clients that we had they speak football first and that was what was most important to them and so we needed to kind of cater our company and cater our employees to be able to do that first and so that was what we kind of decided and now we've kind of become culturally defined by that. So when I was first learning about startups people talked about the team is so important and the culture is so important I didn't really understand what that meant until I started bright and like just to make it really concrete for us culture is kind of like how you feel about the company when you're there like do you have funding your interactions with other people is it frustrating and then the rules that govern that and so I think you know in the first year or for six months before I really understood what culture was it was unintentional and as a result you know people didn't show up for work in time they didn't show up for meetings in time interactions were really tough and the number one thing that now kind of defines our culture was everyone would always raise issues they'd say oh no we can't do that oh no we just have to wait three months for the bank account to open because that's how it works and everyone just raised problems and there were so many problems you could find but then you know because honestly that just wasn't fun and like I didn't want to go to work to every day and like hear what problems we couldn't solve I just started becoming really intentional about saying okay we're not a company where you can raise a problem without raising a potential solution and you don't have to have the solution but you have to present a solution because that habit of just getting in and thinking about what could be the answer then becomes something you take into every single thing you do and then all of a sudden instead of saying engineers are really good at this saying oh no that won't work for this reason because you can always find like the smartest minds can find a reason something won't work but that actually doesn't build a company and it doesn't make it fun and so everyone just started saying oh no we have this like you have to come up with something and we would just like wouldn't respond to emails if they didn't have a solution like like it got harsh but now like it's it's very it's one of the things people value most about right and it makes everyone's life way more fun so that's that's kind of a concrete element of culture that we think about super in a minute I'm going to open it up to questions from the audience so you can start thinking about the burning questions you have for these really interesting folks so let's look out at this room and there are a lot of people here who are aspiring entrepreneurs and just a few years ago you were sitting in their seats are there things that you wish you had done or learned or thought about when you were a student that would have set the stage for making things easier now I can think of two so one I wish that I had thought a lot more about how doing a startup would affect my personal finances well I yeah because I you know my family lives in Texas I don't have any family in the area and I grew to a little bit of debt while I was in graduate school and when we started the company we didn't really have any money and even when we got our first seed funding in we needed to really pay ourselves a relatively modest salary to in order to hire people to really get the company going so it ended up being kind of a pretty high stress in burden to have to worry about my own sort of personal finances and and I ended up having this to really cut costs pretty drastically like I even moved into my car for a few months to cut costs and like get ahead of my finances so I wish I'd sort of thought about that a couple years ago and had maybe saved more or maybe did job on the side or something to really kind of reduce the stress with that another thing that I've done that I wish I started earlier was follow minimalism principles so I have minimized the stuff that I have anything that that doesn't bring any value to my life or has a functional purpose I try to get rid of it I've also done the and I feel this is kind of cliche in the valley but the sort of work uniform where you know I have 14 of the same black shirts and and I regains to the same outfit to work every day so I don't have to think about what I'm going to wear when I go into work I've also just tried to minimize sort of the number of goals that I I've ascribed to any given week or in given day and even to like minimize my thoughts like when I'm in transit somewhere instead of having these random kind of dialogues going in my head I try to just focus on breathing and really appreciate the outdoors and the and the sights around me and it has been huge in terms of reducing stress and increasing happiness and just this the idea that what you have and who you are is enough I think that's that's it's been such a valuable kind of mantra to ascribe to because I think so often like in my Facebook feed you see kind of what everyone has and all these like great things and and it can be easy to kind of fall into that trap of always thinking you can buy something that'll make you happy and just realizing that what you have is good enough because yeah that's all there is great yeah I think um you know just um when I graduated from Stanford I went into a startup and that was you know then the whole dot-com boom has never happened and then I went to a couple of mid-sized companies and then a very large public-traded company and then now it's called come for full circle back into startup again and I think through that path um one thing that I wish I had had been more in front of mine is think about entrepreneurism in a broad sense so I don't think entrepreneurship entrepreneurship is just to be found in startups um you know just you know um looking for bootstrap and you know very small opportunities I think you can find entrepreneurism in a lot of different places and I certainly found a lot of opportunity even in a very large company um where you can carve out um I you know and identify opportunities to be entrepreneurial and to get a lot of um um progress made and things accomplished it may not be as visible um as you know kind of being at a startup but you also have the power of a lot of resources in different levers available within that environment and I think that finding entrepreneurial opportunities even within larger organizations is something that is very valuable to large companies and so I would you know going back I would think about the term entrepreneurism in a much broader way great so I don't think you'll ever be surrounded by more smart ambitious people um and with less of a a failure opportunity than you are at this point in time um if you if you try something now and fail you're still in school um you still went to Stanford um you're not gonna you're not gonna starve um and uh as life goes on you know you get it gets more complicated it gets harder you know they're like the failure actually becomes um more significant um and you're also surrounded I mean if you look around you're surrounded by so many intelligent people that um don't really understand um that there's a ton of risks out there um and that optimism is exactly what you need when you're starting a company you want crazy people they will say no we can figure out we can do it and that don't have you know 50 years of experience saying oh no that's really hard to do actually or that won't work for this reason um and so you know my advice and what I wish I did more of um at Stanford was just go out and meet tons of smart people um see what makes them tick um find something that I find interesting and then just go try try to do something while I'm at Stanford um like again failure is not terrible if you do it now um and it's still not terrible when you graduate but um think about the unique situation you're in right now it is actually an incredible situation and I remember thinking oh I need more experience like I need to work for Chevron or another company for a bunch of years and I did it was helpful but you know that I didn't need to um I could have done much more while I was in school um and again it's just like signing up for that race that's the most important step for me I think the biggest thing that I learned out of going through a startup and going through the process is figuring out what support means to you and if that social support or personal support or whatever other type of support you need to turn to and things get really hard uh is is figuring out that early on so that it's not too late into kind of when you're deep into a problem and you haven't slept all week and you're trying to figure out this one issue um figuring out and looking into yourself to figure out what what do I need and and if I do need to turn to someone else for support then then I know who are those people that I can turn to when I need it um because then by the time you're there then then you can certainly kind of prepare yourself for for that great thank you those were all very thoughtful thank you so who has a burning question in the audience in the middle here and please speak up yeah how important would you say is higher education like uh MBA PhD um to entrepreneurial success when you are committed undergraduate to first pursue higher education or go right into trying to so I'm going to repeat the question how important is having a higher degree uh beyond a bachelor's degree to get a master's or a PhD in order to pursue these opportunities you'll probably get very different answers there um it depends on what you want to do um but one thing that maybe useful in that decision is you can backfill a lot of expertise in a company once you get it started um so you can hire a bunch of PhDs or people who have had 50 years of experience Zuckerberg didn't know everything you know there was about I don't know all sorts of things but he hired some of the world smartest people um and he just had to get the ball rolling um you know if you want to invent a new technology um then um to get the ball rolling you may have to have that expertise yourself um but I would I would frame it as what do you need to get the ball rolling such that you can either start to get some traction in a market show that show that people want what you're building show some early success or erase some funding um such that you can then hire the next person because it's all about just getting to the next step um and you're not a one man team like you're you're gonna hire people and you're probably gonna hire really good people yeah I would also say it depends on what you're in but I I would say that you do need I think as a founder it's very good to have domain expertise the one good thing about computer science is that you can get kind of like the PhD equivalent um knowledge at home before even become an undergrad I mean you can you can learn a lot about computer science on the internet and like for free so um if you're not in computer science you're doing you know um more physical science than to get the domain expertise you kind of do need to be in a school I mean if you're gonna do like nuclear physics you know you can't really do that at home you don't you don't you don't so I so I I think with the exception of maybe computer science and and um maybe some other feels to where you can get domain expertise outside the school then then I would say start as when you can but if if there's something that you know very specific that you need to get the domain expertise in through school then do it um I also don't think there's anything wrong with like going to school first and then um then starting a company I mean um you know timing does matter in these cases so if if you if an opportunity knocks and you want to go for it go for it but I just don't think you need to force uh doing a startup right out of school I mean I mean don't it's worked for for Chevron and and you know like that might be a way if you don't have a family that can you know support you and write your a trek to kind of help you get along like getting a job first and like building your own personal finances might be a good way to do that and and then wait till something comes along that um where you have the passion you have the good idea you have the team that you can form and then do a company um so I I wouldn't force it if there's not anything there that you're you're interested in passionate about a different perspective yeah I mean I think um it's about credibility um it's about credibility with investors it's about credibility with the leadership team that you want to put together and the people that you want to build um around you before that organization and if you don't know enough um particularly if you're coming from a technical angle if you don't know enough um it's very hard to to establish that credibility and um and the most excellent people the most excellent talent in the world want to work with the most excellent people and so um building a nucleus of that expertise I think is very important particularly if you're coming from a scientific or engineering background okay I would have done entrepreneurship if it wasn't for my master's program here I didn't undergrad at UCSB where there was not a strong entrepreneur and entrepreneurial component um of school and so I think for me I wouldn't have done it otherwise without the resources here at Stanford great next question right over here hello my question would be what what was your relation with to failure before so the question is did your relationship with failure change through this experience sort of the first startup I was at completely failed and I remember um leaving that opportunity um thinking very distinctly boy I've got a lot to learn before I want to try this again and some of this may be domain specific right I mean it's it's hard and with the capital requirements and the talent requirements and life sciences um to to really start with like a one or two person shop um but I did feel like um you know from that first experience I wanted to go through the rigor of learning many from no many different opportunities before starting with a new um venture again and I feel like with Grille it's kind of finally come full circle where you know I feel like I've gained the maturity and the knowledge to to be able to be credible in doing that so I took Steve Blanks course here the lean launch pad and so um I described that course as like a startup simulator um we formed a team and we uh did the early workings of of a startup and um that was pretty much I would say like my our first failure um as as a startup it was a completely different team we were actually trying to build um retractable high heel shoes um in that class as as like the the class project um and we had kind of founder issues I mean we we never formed a real company but like in in the context of this the simulation we had like founder issues and it really made me realize that like the team that you work with is so important I can't stress this enough like what Jonas said it it's just huge um it's it's like a marriage you you need to find a good partner to have uh uh the marriage that works you know for both of you so you know I got really lucky with the team that we formed that um you know we we we we were Kendra and I we worked together for many many years when I PhD together and then Nicholas um we found in the business school and we worked together doing doing a business plan competition and even though we didn't win the competition like just working together as a team was really insightful to know that okay we can make this work we can support each other and and that was huge so that that was probably like my first failure and and startup so uh have you guys read the book I think it's called The Power of Habit it's one of my favorite books it basically argues like and this has actually been life like transforming I'd suggest everyone read this book that things that you do on a regular basis are easy to keep doing and things that you don't are really hard um to do and I think failure is actually one of them specifically recovering from failure um gets a lot easier the more you do it and it's really hard if you've never done it um and if you live a really cushy life um and something I didn't realize is that you know we have all these stories about great entrepreneurs or people that are really successful and it seems like it was really easy for them to do it and they always just had success and that is just not true um those people are actually just really really really good at recovering from failure um and so I would say embrace it like I failed at every stage of my life um and progressively I just got better and better at failing and recovering um and even Chevron like it was a disaster trying to get Chevron to really scale up renewable energy and we faced so many barriers and that just really hardened me um and it was nothing like the failures and challenges that um came when I was starting bright um but I just started to get to this point where I was like not afraid of challenges anymore I was like I don't know how I'm gonna solve this but I know I've solved all the other ones and so I know I know it will happen and I was just in that habit um and so it was possible and um there's you know there's two reasons startups fail you run out of money or you quit and you could say you know it all really boils up into you just quitting because if you run out of money you're and you decide to quit you're quitting um and so how can you make yourself not want to quit and not quit just keep going. I've learned to develop a sense of humor around failure I think that's really gotten through some of our hard times kind of of age old monitor strategy plus time equals comedy so if you're able to kind of have a light arted sense about it it can help you kind of push forward and try again. Great another question way back in the back. Two quick questions how uh can anyone can anyone if you share your journey of finding a mentor and how you was succeeded in finding that that particular mentor what kind of rope-ounce you hid in that search second one how did you make your first hire that came outside of your immediate network so how did it work out. So the question had to do with mentors that finding a mentor and the second had to do with your first hire you know how did you convince the first person that you weren't crazy and that they're gonna join your team who wants to jump in. I always thought that um uh that I needed one mentor for everything and I think I realized that you probably want to have like a mentor for every single thing you need help on um no one person can be the expert at everything and so I just looked at all the challenges I had and I tried to find like the one person in the world that I wanted to help me with that and a lot of it was just like cold outreach like seeing if I had a connection to that person but a lot of it was just emailing that person through alumni databases for instance and you'll have a surprising amount of success if you just go and do that or at least you know it worked it worked for me um so figure out who you want to talk to and talk to them. Yeah I think from from my standpoint um you know there's a lot of luck I think involved in finding a mentor and finding someone with whom you have chemistry and you click um and you know I've you know I've haven't many mentors in my career but um and great managers but you know a lot of it you know does boil down to luck but when you find someone who you think is a great candidate to help guide you or work with you on uncertain issues um I think always finding an opportunity to provide value back to them initially you know get on the radar you know you know how how can you help them think through a problem or um you know if they're in a leadership position what can you do to help them execute an idea um how can you bridge um you know functionally with with other pieces that need to come together in order to accomplish something um you know that that's always been a very effective approach from from my perspective. Yeah I think similar to what Jenna said that mentors come in many different ways and places and you don't need just one so for me I've kind of collected them uh over the years so people that I turn to for specific things um similar to kind of the social support that I was talking about as you kind of find um those that you can turn to even if it's not something that's specific to their domain it doesn't need to be specific to your industry or what project that you're working on but uh but if it's something that that they can offer social support on uh I think that's the important thing so I've always thought about you know who are those people kind of over the the years that I can um that I can turn to for uh for that and that that's kind of how I've approached it as opposed to one specific person that um that need to find in a specific technical expertise. Great another question yes how is your personal health and wellness effective your decision making? So how's your personal health and wellness affected your decision making? um well yeah I mean for the most part my health I think is pretty good um I don't know if any major kind of illnesses that I have at the moment but I do think a lot about like work-life balances and like how to maintain uh especially really good uh mental health because it's um I I tend to be a little prone to like high stress and like anxiety sometimes so um for me just um trying to integrate in little like walks throughout the day and um deep breathing and things like that has really um helped me kind of like clear my mind and and rethink about the task at hand um I will say that um you know doing a startup it's there are definitely times when there are intense um phases where you know like well for us if we write grants so um you know what a grant is do we have to kind of all rally to get that grant together and so um things like going to the gym and um remembering to take walks can kind of fall by the wayside so um having other people who are really supportive of that and like can remind you okay all right we've been working for 15 hours let's stop take a break let's we'll clear our minds and come back and kind of always be reminded of that because I think it can be you can very easily fall down a slippery slope of of your health taking a back seat to kind of the the work and because you're just so driven sometimes and so focused on what you're doing so um so yeah adding little bits in and um having other people who care about that is anyone else want to chime in I think it's important to exercise every day um it's like the one thing that has helped me maintain my sanity um and keep perspective and it's way easier to do if you do it every single day so I'm going to ask the last question to all of you about leadership uh you are all now in these leadership roles how do you think about leadership and developing your own leadership and and you know how would you describe your leadership style yeah leadership to me um means taking responsibility for things that go wrong of which we've had a few things go wrong and so I think owning up to those things and especially when you're when you're when you're leading a team and the responsibility falls on you know multiple people for that then that ultimately reflects on you so so being able to to as a leader to accept those things and understand when you're running a startup that there are you know financial and other consequences that come out of that of which are you know fairly large um being able to kind of prepare for those scenarios and and being able to you know expect what will you do when you have to accept some of those consequences I think for me leadership is a couple of things um the first is leadership by example and so I think um we're all responsible for modeling the behaviors and um the values that we want surrounding us um at our at our companies and the other element of it is empowerment so I think um you know it's amazing what people can do when they feel like they own something they're accountable for it they're responsible for it and they have the the trust um from you as a leader to be able to do a great job and that you'll help them if they trip and so I think that sort of empowerment is incredibly um um no fulfilling um and and I've experienced that for myself and so that's what I tried to model as well I just want to reiterate that last point I totally agree I think empowering others is like one of the most important things you can do as a leader like I'm going to do a couple things and I'm not good at a ton of things um and so the only way you can make progress is if you really enable others and it's really scary just so you know to just like hand over especially if you start a company to hand over your baby and say like no you make the decision like I trust you you have you have more information than I do which by the way you'll never have enough information and so other people probably that are closer to the opportunity will have way more um so just figure out how to start letting go like higher well so you can let go trust those people enable those people they'll step up way more than you think and I think well that's that's worked really well for us yeah I would agree with everything that was said and also just kind of maintaining the big picture knowing where you're going with the vision what are the goals where they're intermediate goals and like communicating that and make sure everyone's in the same page well I'm sure you'd agree this was really really interesting thank you so much to all of our fabulous guests you have been listening to the Draper Fisher-Jurvis and entrepreneurial thought leader series brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program you can find additional podcasts and videos of these lectures online at e-coner.stanford.edu
