 You are listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. I am pleased to introduce our speaker, Mary Baker. You have the bio, either online, to our friends out there in the ether, or here in person. Let me just point out a couple of things. She's the CEO of PlayFirst right now, which she joined recently. The last time I had a chance to see Mary and actually see her talking, it was just fantastic. She was the founding CEO of Navigenics, which is in that same category of personalized medicine and so on with 23 me. And I hope we hear a little bit about that today as well as about PlayFirst. Before that, she was in the health care field as well with BabyCenter, as you can see. And then before that, a great consumer technology company into it. I think the connection here, and what I'm particularly pleased to point out, is that she served as a member of the Board of Trustees for this university for seven years. And that is the overall governing body. That's who President Hennessy reports to. For the university, I had a chance to be a faculty rep on that for a little while recently for a couple of years. And I just saw how much time trustees give to the university, frankly, of volunteer bases. So I really appreciated service to the university that way. But the coolest thing is, in her real connection, her first connection to Stanford, was she was an econ and sociology major here. So, you know, hooray for humanities and sciences. So let's welcome Mary back to campus. Well, thank you all. Thank you, Tom. It's great to be here. Great to be back on campus. Good to see all of you. I'm going to try to go through, give a little bit of a background, talk about some of the experience I've had, and hopefully be successful at weaving a few lessons and learnings along the way that, you know, I hope you'll find to be valuable. And then, of course, have time at the end to answer some questions. Of course, today is tax day, which if I sold my old job at Intuit, you wouldn't see me and you wouldn't have seen me for a long time leading up to this. But thanks to TurboTax being here, I was able to get my taxes done early. So okay. So, came to Stanford. How does sociology major get started in the technology industry? That's a good question. You know, when I came here, this is back in the BC times, sort of before computers were popular around campus. And the first time I'd ever seen a computer was in my freshman dorm. One of the guys had an Exid-64 cassette tape drive computer. You can just stick a little cassette tape in the computer and you have a little green screen with black type. And I thought that was the coolest thing in the world. And so my first, actually my first start with entrepreneurial ventures was while I was a student. I had the opportunity to work for a small software company that was doing the very first home finance package on the Apple II. And I got involved in computers from that point in time and realized that they were great because you could make them do pretty much whatever you wanted them to do. And that was a great way to solve consumer problems. What I want to do is talk about some of the things in learning along the way. And I'd say one starting point that I've learned is the notion of sort of going through the open door when opportunities present themselves, take advantage of them. And for me that started with getting exposed to computers while a student taking an extra job. And when I graduated, of course, as an econ sociology major, one gets to that point and says, huh, what am I going to do out there in the world? And the first job that I had out of school was actually working for a local stock broker who had been at EF Hutton in Palo Alto Square in a taught class my senior year on investing. And so he offered me an internship out of college for $100 a month was my great after spending four years at Stanford first job opportunity. But what was great about that was getting to work for somebody and you wouldn't necessarily expect this out of an EF Hutton, out of a local office, out of a stock broker. But who gave me the opportunity to try new things who supported me as a recent graduate in learning and growing and developing. So one of the after being there for a little bit, one of the first entrepreneurial ventures so to speak that I convinced this group to do, again this is in the days of type setting and time sharing on minis and mainframes, was bring a Macintosh and PC and laser printer in through the back door and convert everything we were doing to type to desktop publishing and custom databases and stuff that we built ourselves and moving it that way. And I think that what was great about that opportunity was we dramatically improved the productivity of what we did. We taught, you know, again this was like the first time nobody was using computers within these office environments, personal computers, showed what they could do. And for me as a young person just out of college was the beginning of getting that confidence of knowing if I can put myself out there, if I can work hard enough to gain the confidence of my boss and her boss, then I can keep learning and keep growing and doing new things that can continue to keep my career, my job interesting, and sort to make a real difference. So I think that that's one of the things I would encourage you to do is to take advantage of those opportunities, make the most of the opportunities that you have, and being when you have a boss or a work environment where you can really learn to take advantage of that. I went to Intuit early on, again in the notion of I was looking, I had two offers, one from Intuit and one from another company where they were much, I had a much, much more financially attractive offer, much better company, bigger company, you know, look like it was going to be around for a while, but made the decision to go to Intuit, there were about 30 people left Intuit at that time, nobody had heard of the company, nobody really heard of Quicken or Intuit, but made the decision to go there because of the people, because of the time you got done interviewing with all the people, the senior leadership, having confidence that these guys had seen enough things, had enough experience that I could really learn from them. And that was absolutely the wrong financial decision to have made in the short term, but the absolute right decision to have made over the long run of being involved with people and who were very thoughtful, very methodical, and, you know, again, creating opportunities to learn and grow in responsibility. So Intuit, so how do you, you know, lessons, you know, learned along the way, so one of the great things are Intuit in the early days, so, you know, 30 people were there, nobody had heard of the company, but what the company had, which I think is, again, what if you're going to go out there and start a new business, I think a core, fundamental proposition is the relentless focus on wowing the customer, right? You know, successful products are those which solve a consumer's problem and do it to the point where they're not just happy, right, but they're wowed, that they're so excited, they're just happy, they're unlikely to go tell their friends about it. But if you wow them, if they're so excited by that experience that they'll go and tell their friends, that allows you to really build an organization. I remember when I started one of the first days, first questions I asked got cook was, well, how are we going to succeed in this business? We only have three sales people. How are we going to be successful against all these other companies? And he said, well, actually, you know, we have a million sales people, you know, because our goal is we can, is to make those customers so excited they'll go out and tell their friends. And so the relentless focus back then was truly understanding what was the customer need and the insight was, okay, let's try and experiment. How many people out in this audience love paying bills? Okay, nobody. How many people love doing their taxes? Nobody. So the key was always, how do you make doing that task faster and easier so that you can get it done faster and get on with your life? And into it was, or quick in, was not the first product in the marketplace. We were not the biggest company. We did not have the most resources, but it was a fundamental understanding from the consumer that I really hate doing this, make it fast and easy. So when you're starting out in a company, the easiest thing to do is to listen to all the feedback and try to implement it all. They want this, this, this, this, and this. I'm going to do it. Well that might sound hard. That's actually the easy thing. The hard thing is to take all the feedback and stay really focused to stay relentlessly focused on the cost, the driving customer need and what you can do to solve that need. So well, our competitors were adding more and more functionality into the product. Quick and stayed narrow and focused on making it faster. In my team insight, in quick books, of when you're starting a small business, people go in to start a small business because they love running a restaurant. They love clothing. They like running a shop. They don't do it. But what happens is the business grows is the whole deal of managing your finances takes over and becomes a bigger and bigger piece of it. So again, keeping that fast and simple. And as into it, as into it grew, the other piece that I want to encourage all of you to think about, especially if you're going to start a company or get involved in the company early on, is coming back to that focus on setting a culture. Setting a culture in the company, what you want it to be. And the reason when it's small, when there's you and three of your friends in a room, well you chose, you chose, they're your friends, so you're doing this together. There's sort of a self-defining culture. But as a company starts to get bigger, you need to be very clear about what it is that you want the company to stand for and how it's going to make decisions and what your philosophies are. And so it's, you know, adding to it, we actually shut down the whole company for two days, took everybody off-site, worked on vision, mission values. And it was a defining moment in the company's history that allowed it to grow and continue to move forward. And this last week I had the opportunity to have lunch with a founder of a very, right now, a very hot company, small company still, but I think we'll be in the news a lot over the next 12 months in the valley. And these were questions that as the company had very quickly gone from 10 people, the 50 people to 100 people in a matter of just a few months, they were starting to see the company burst at the seams because of a lack of really understanding those things. And it's really important because how do you know when you hire somebody in, are they going to be consistent with what you believe in, with how you want to create and grow your company? And it's an important piece to make sure is paying attention to early on and that you focus on doing. So on from Intuit, which was also great, the piece about wowing customers is we would literally get letters, of course email wasn't popular quite yet back then. We would literally get letters from customers saying thank you for giving us quick in. It enabled me to save money to send my kid to college. Thank you for a quick in. It gave me the tools to save money to buy a house. Thank you for a quick in. It saved my marriage. And you can see the value, the value that you're really doing out there in the world with the products and services that you provide. And I had the opportunity coming out of Intuit and that's actually a good story as well. Because at some point you'll go get a job and you'll be doing things and you'll need to leave. You'll need to change jobs. How do you change jobs successfully? So for me, leaving Intuit, I sat down with Bill Campbell who was CEO of the company then and we talked through the whole thing. We talked through what I was looking at, why I thought it would be good opportunity is now the right time and made that a very conscious discussion. And that's something I always encourage to people that work for me to do. There's obviously going to be a time when you work someplace that it is time to go and do something different. And it's important to have that be a constructive conversation so things can be managed accordingly. But had the opportunity to go from Intuit to Baby Center. Baby Center was one of the, well, certainly today, the worldwide leading worldwide resource from new and expected parents. Baby Center is online content, community and commerce for largely starting in pregnancy and moving through in the first year of the years of a child's life. And the key fundamental insight with Baby Center is mass personalization. That by understanding a simple piece of information, which is a baby's due date, you can create a highly personalized experience that can feed to somebody who's seven weeks pregnant versus four months pregnant versus has a two month old baby, a customized experience with exactly what's relevant to that person at that time. Baby Center grew, when I left a few years ago, we had two thirds of all pregnant women in the United States on Baby Center, about two thirds of all women in the UK. And before I left, we were able to expand the service to China and India and throughout Europe after Johnson and Johnson purchased the company. We were able to leverage their infrastructure to continue to expand broadly. And again, I think when you look at a company like Baby Center, so fundamental insight being when people are pregnant, they have a high need for information. They have a voracious appetite for information. But people are also busy. And so how can you be, how can you provide people information, how can you leverage technology? And in fact, when in those early days people said, oh, you'll never succeed. Books are good enough. Why do I need to get this information online? There's plenty of good books. Doctors' offices have plenty of free information. There's lots of resources. Why do I need to go online? But yet, millions of women every month, every day, would come to the website. And it's because of the benefit of technology to being able to be applied to serve information as you need it, the relevant information to connect in the community experience and to have access to people who are like you and sharing through the same experience. The interesting piece, I think one of the interesting things to think about in Baby Center, is you would wonder about a San Francisco-based web 1.0, 2.0-ish kind of company getting bought by a company like Johnson & Johnson. Is that something that's going to fit? Does that make a lot of sense? And what I'll share with you is that it was a great merger. Johnson & Johnson is a company with deep values and integrity and purpose and mission that aligned very well with what Baby Center was doing. So that although the business was different, the fundamental business dynamics were different, the values of the organization were consistent so that decisions could be made because they're made from a point of having a common value system. And when you start with that, it's actually a lot easier to make those decisions than if those values are not aligned from the beginning. And then on to Navagenix. Let's talk a little bit about Navagenix. Navagenix is a leading company in the new space of personalized medicine, writ large, DNA testing. The idea is that by sending us a sample of your saliva, we can tell you a broad range of health conditions that you're genetically predisposed for and what you can do to mitigate any adverse health issues that might come up. So the whole idea is preventive healthcare. So Navagenix, and Tom mentioned 23 in me, which is certainly the other leading company in the space. I think they're the two companies who get the most awareness in the space and certainly the most well-funded and back-and-supported. So 23 in me, you're sitting there, you're building a company in a whole new industry and you know a competitive company exists. You know this company exists. You don't know exactly what's going to happen and you got to build your business in the same time. So the strategy that we took with Navagenix was, all right, this is very, very early in this industry, we believe it's where things are going to go, right? I mean, healthcare has got to be more personalized. We can't keep treating people on the basis of you know you're a 40-year-old woman, therefore these things are the things we're going to check for, right? We're different. We're, you know, there are different things in our backgrounds, our history and what we're doing medicine has to get more personalized in order to bring the cost down over the long run. We also have to get more preventive focus, especially in this country, right? We can't just wait and let things develop. We have to take control earlier on. So absolutely convinced words are going to go in the long run, but how do you get a market started? How do you start from scratch? And so the strategy we took with Navagenix was one that said, look, while we don't know how fast the healthcare establishment is going to adopt it, you have to maintain credibility. You have to be viewed. There is definitely a conversation between a consumer and a doctor. It's, you know, in when you're talking about healthcare. So you have to maintain that credibility with the medical establishment, but we were concerned that doctors were not going to adopt it fast enough for us to build a business. So we wanted to go direct to consumers to have them, to enable them to purchase it, purchase our services. So you know, our positioning ended up being, so what we did is we took a look at it and said, look, we are going to position what we are doing as being the credible science, credible medicine, but yet being consumer friendly, so as a market develops, we could decide which end of the spectrum, if it's pure consumer or if it's pure medical, we could move to figure ourselves the most opportunity. And what we learned as we went into the market, placed we learned a few things. One is our competitor took a spot clearly in the consumer realm. And so that's, you know, if you viewed it as a spectrum, that put them in one spot and gave us the whole rest of the market opportunity to take advantage of. And so as we started to come to market and learn and watch, which is a thing you'll have to do if you're going to start a company or be part of a startup, you have your best ideas and best research going into it, but you got to learn and watch. You got to watch what the market's telling you, you know, actually being in the market is the best research you can do and the best research you can have. And so what we learned was that actually doctors were much more ready and willing to accept the notion of genetics, much more willing to get on the back of preventive healthcare, much more ready to engage in discussions with their patients about how to improve healthcare over the long run than we had given them credit for early on. And so in, you know, in about six months, within six months after the launch of the product, we had enough evidence that that's where the market was going, both in programs were able to establish with people like Mayo Clinic and the Cleveland Clinic and individual doctors signing up to offer our service to their patients, that we decided to take a whole right turn and move further down that spectrum and really go after the whole physician side of the business, which I do fundamentally believe is how, if we're once that side of the business is willing to adopt it, it's going to enable us to enable navigational to be a much more of a standard practice of medicine component of healthcare than trying to go up against it from the outside. And so this is another thing to think about too when you're running a company. So you're, let's say you're an entrepreneurial founder of a company, you're CEO, and you of course have a significant interest in the company's success. And all of a sudden you've realized that you've decided to take the company in this direction that your background in skill set is actually not suited for. So what do you do in that situation? And so for me, I have a great board, which is one of the things that you're going to want to also pay attention to is really how do you construct your board, how do you work with your board, how do you take advantage of all the skill sets that they have to bring to the table. And we sat down and we said, you know, if the company, this is clearly where the market opportunity is. And you know, what do, you know, can we bring in somebody who really has a skill set, who's built physician sales channels, who understands that environment, to grow the company forward. And so in fact, the company recently announced a new CEO who in fact comes with that skill set and will be the right person to move that company forward. And I say that as a story of, I mean, navigetics, the opportunity, I mean, just in the short period of time, helping people find, I mean, we have plenty of examples now within less than a year on the market of finding the people with high genetic risk for cancer, helping them get an early screen, finding early stages of cancer and addressing it early on. If you listen to the President of the American Cancer Society, you'll see that right now the best cure we may have for cancer, you know, after billions of dollars of research is early detection. And that's the benefit of something like what Navigenex can do is enable and giving the clue about who we should start screening early for. And that's a powerful thing. I think when you start a company or you're involved in an early startup, the reality is, right, most don't make it over the long run, right? The first startups don't succeed. That's the risk inherent in doing this startup. It's a risk inherent in being an entrepreneur. And so I encourage you to find things where A, you're going to learn people, you're going to learn from, and products and services that you can feel passionate about. Things that you can understand, you can make the tie back to how they make people's lives better. So for me in making the transition to play first, the interesting, so I had you decide to make a transition to play first. I hadn't gone out to look at gaming as a place to go, but I hadn't targeted that specifically. And wasn't sure initially that that was going to be the right place for me coming out of like doing DNA testing personalized medicine into gaming. But the over Christmas, I brought home stack of play first games and sat down with my kids. I have three girls. And we were playing these games. And one of play first games is a game called Wedding Dash. And my 10 year old was playing this game. And after a couple of days, she had reached the highest level of gameplay. And I said, okay, well, what did you learn? Let's say you're going to go out and set up a wedding catering business. What did you learn about how to be a successful in business? And she's 10, right? So she comes back and she says, well, I learned that if you make your customers happy, you can get more money. And if you get more money, you can invest it in your business. And then you just keep making your customers happy and your business can go. And I classed that back and I said, well, gosh, there's an awful lot of CEOs I know who haven't figured that part out. And if by playing a game, you can help people. And one of the things to recognize is casual gaming is largely an audience of women, 35 and older are typical casual gamers. And one of the other things that's interesting is actually most small businesses are started by women. And the general flow of that is women step out of the workforce. Oftentimes when they have kids, find it hard to get back in the workforce or start the run businesses. And if those women are playing diner dash and wedding dash and the other play first products, and they can by virtue of doing that, learn some fundamental things, feel empowered and confident to go start their business, that's a great thing. And so for me, the hook into a company like play first is the role that I fundamentally believe the company through games can play in perhaps an educational piece there. Secondly is the role why do women 35 and older play these casual games? You talk to any demographic market researcher and they say, well, this is the demographic that is the most time stress demographic of all. So the role of casual games in their life is to provide the little stress reliever that little break during the day. And through the work that did at Baby Center, and this was something that I started at into it, we do, I think they call it, these days ethnographic research. We call it follow me home testing. We go into the homes of the consumers or a target market and just try to understand their lives. And you go into a home of a Baby Center customer, a stay at home mom, and you get a picture of a life that's very hectic, very stressed, and not always full of positive feedback. And the role that casual games can play is giving a break. So she can get back on track for getting through the rest of the day and the rest of her responsibilities. And one of the hallmarks to casual games is lots of positive feedback. So you can feel a sense of accomplishment and achievement in what you're doing. And I think those are great roles to play in somebody's day. In each day, if every day play first, can put a little bit of joy and delight in someone's life, I think that's a pretty cool thing. And so I think there's a lot of other things that are interesting and very appealing about play first. But for me, again, I'll say what I've learned over time is you don't know for sure if what you're going to work on is going to be successful. That's the thing that's, in my opinion, fun about being involved in startups is that opportunity to learn and grow and figure it out. But if you're going to work on that, you're going to spend a lot of time and energy doing it. It's great to do it on something you feel passionate about and you think can make a difference in the world. So I encourage you to find those opportunities. So I think if I were to add a couple more thoughts on coming on board at play first. So this is day 23 for me at play first. So it's still pretty new. And one of the things that I've tried to do, again, this is a company. So the company's five years old. It's about 100 people in the company, you know, millions of people using our games. And it's really trying to, you know, we've sat down tomorrow. We have a company meeting. We've made drafts of mission and values. Try to be clear about a corporate culture. Try to be clear about objectives, goals, and strategies and align organizations to work in the same direction. We, something, you know, we've had the entire executive team read good to great a book that I'm sure many of you are familiar with. You know, the importance of the core tenants in that book, I think, are great lessons for running a company. And I think it's still one of the best management books there. And the, one of the key things I think in the company, you know, is to be very purposeful, to be conscious of what you do and how you do it. To be end, and even, you know, as a co-founder, as a leader in an organization, you know, there's interesting, you know, some organizations that I've seen, you know, the, so there's the company wide email, right? The company wide emails that go out. Some organizations that I've seen, so now the company wide email, you know, a recognition of people who stayed in and worked all weekend, you know, recognizing the people who they're all night long, they get something done. And there's nothing wrong with that. But to be conscious of the message that sounds, that sends the message of that's what we expect. That's what we want to have happen. I've been at companies where the company wide emails that go out are the ones around congratulating somebody for negotiating the heck out of a service contract. So we got the best pricing possible. Congratulations somebody for doing something, you know, the cheapest way possible. And that really breeds a culture of people being really conscious about spending, being really conscious about value, being really conscious about how they're using the company's money. And that's okay too. You know, there's another company that have been at where all the emails that go out are about congratulating around product launches. You know, product launches all about product. And that's great too. There's nothing wrong with that. But the thing that I want to ask you to think about when you get into those roles is being conscious. What do you want to be valued in the company? Because what you do, what those company emails are, set the tone for the whole company. And you want to be conscious about those things. You want to be conscious about those messages that you're delivering. Because those are the cues that the team will take to know what it takes to be successful in the organization and where that focus is going to be. So I think that I want to end with a few notes about building a company just to summarize. I think the key pieces would be focusing on wowing your customers, just making just that relentless focus and understanding their needs go into their homes. Don't leave it to the marketing guys. You know, get the engineers out into their homes. Get people who are building the products and services. Get everybody in the company to really understand who the customer is and what those needs are. And how technology can solve those needs. I think the best breakthroughs have ever seen be made is when we got engineers in the home of a customer, engineers working directly with a customer to really understand those needs and come up with great solutions using technology. I encourage you to focus. It's really easy to do a lot of things. It's really hard to do a few things. Focus. It's, you know, I remember early on, adding into it early on, one of the other guys and I had made a recommendation to Scott, we should get into the tax business. We should go buy this Turbo Tax Company. That's going to be great. We should do it. Scott said, no, we're not going to go do it. We're going to focus on building quicken. And a few years later, we went and bought Turbo Tax. Now was I right because we eventually did it? Well I was right, it was a good idea, but I think Scott was right to wait. Because if we had at that point in time, it's not clear the company could have really absorbed it. It was quick and strong enough. We have a strong enough management team. Did we have the internal capabilities and scalable process and systems to bring something like that on board? Probably not. And we paid a lot more money later on, but it was the right thing to wait. We waited to go to international. We waited to do things. You know, a baby center, you know, we went internationally because we had Johnson and Johnson to work on their back to go and do that. We debated all these things much earlier in the company's history. But if you overextend yourself too much early on, there's a balance of you have to try some things, but you do too many things. It's hard to do anything. Well, and lastly, I just want to reiterate, build the culture, be conscious of what kind of a company you want and what kind of a culture you want. That feeds into who you hire and that's going to feed into the company that you've got. Okay. Do we have any questions out there? Yes. I know the genetic information on this information. I'm from Pastor Smith. Good. While I was a leader, how did you protect your piece that was found, called insurance issues at genetic counseling, just because I got information on this really hard to get? Yeah. So the question was, the genetic information on the discrimination act was signed, I think, a little over a year ago by President Bush and went into effect earlier this year. What that does is, too, it's another area of protection from discrimination, in this case from genetics in terms of employment and insurance. And so the question was about how do we at Navigenex protect people from that information, and in genetic counseling? So there's still, the reality is there are still gaps to fill. There are still gaps in making sure people are protected from genetic discrimination. But the reality when you look at the state, the legal history and filings, there haven't been a lot, there's not a strong legal basis for where those issues have come up. So there's not, in reality, there are not a lot of situations where those discrimination issues have evolved. Gina makes a really good step in plugging some of the holes. There are a lot of steps underway by some of the legislators who push for Gina in the first place to come back and fill in those pieces that are left. And it has to get put into place for personalized medicine to be successful in the long run. And so there are a lot of movements to make that happen. It's one of the reasons that Navigenex started out in going direct to consumers was that you have the information you can choose whether to share it with other people or not, and they're before protect your privacy to the extent possible. What the Gina passing, it does give enough more protection. Navigenex strategy in the marketplace, again, part of our effort to help consumers, it's where the company, where the county, where it's any counselors available. The interesting thing that's really evolved a lot, which any counselors, again, as doctors have been more interested in this, are genetic counselors who spend a lot of their time educating the physicians, which, again, is the right scalable, sustainable thing to have happen in the marketplace a lot of physicians. Didn't get a lot of training on genetics when they went through medical school 20 or 30 years ago. And so there's a big role and a gap right now that's been identified. And really, how do we make sure in medical school training that we get more genetics training? How do we deal with the people who've graduated in the last 20 years in reinforcing that? So while the Arjunate Council is certainly available to all of our consumers, the interesting thing, again, as you watch a business after you launch it, is the amount of the time and effort is now that doctors are bringing to their practice. We can really work in educating the physicians. And that's, that, in the end, is the great solution. If you're talking about your results with your physician, then that helps to mitigate some of the concerns that come across and all can be put in perspective. What do you want to see on the players' company, why do you ask? What do I want to see on the players' company, why do you ask? I think that it's a dedication to excellence. And I think that part of it for me is I want everybody in the company to feel that they have a role in achieving the company's goals. So if you segment it and you only talk about the product people, how do the guys in finance or how does the whole rest of the company feel that alignment? And so what I want to look for are stories that celebrate excellence, stories that celebrate people going that one step farther, either through innovation, creativity, perseverance, so that allows me to take it whenever functional area you might be and highlight those sort of stories because what I want people to do is always go that step farther. Yeah. It's been said that your research has a near-depth experience at some point. I'm curious. You've been in a number of startups. What have been your strengths as a sort of interfacing with BCs and funding? Any funding issues? The question was most every startup has a near-death experience. What have I seen of that? Specifically also what have I seen from BCs and working on the fundraising side? So while into it and baby center, so have both been good successes, and I have every confidence and avigenics in play first will as well, I've also either invested personally or been on the board of or had some time working at some other smaller startups that haven't made it, that have gone through that death experience and in fact died. And what are some of the commonalities? I think that staying focused, hiring great people and getting committed investors is an important piece in the whole overall piece of being successful. Into it was an interesting story. We're into it could not attract venture capital investment in the early days. Scott Cook was a Crisco brand manager and his co-founder was just graduated from Stanford, not a very fundable proposition for doing consumer finance software besides the market was already crowded so how the heck are you going to win? And into it was a classic story of being self-funded friends and family for a long time which created an initial culture of austerity. And that pervaded so the company got to be profitable as quickly as it could. And eventually did get VC money at a point much later on when it was viewed as being really important to help position the company for future growth phases. Baby Center went through a near death experience and the company had first been purchased by E-toys. People may remember E-toys during the whole .com boom of years ago. And so E-toys purchased Baby Center for all stock. And at E-toys IPO they were worth a billion dollars on the day of their IPO in must have been April or maybe May or June of 1999. And let's see somewhere around a year and a half later we're in the process of filing for bankruptcy. And so one of the things of course to remember when your engagement start up is sometimes and you will learn this with your stock options sometimes they can go to zero. And so you know Baby Center, as E-toys was looking for its strategic alternatives, I had a hard time seeing who is going to value Baby Center. Who is going to value a Baby Center versus E-toys in that proposition. And as CEO of Baby Center I felt like my responsibilities to the Baby Center employees, to the Baby Center customers, certainly to help the E-toys team. So while I was supporting them in shopping E-toys I also went out and separately shopped Baby Center. And we were apparently the fastest acquisition ever in J&J history. I give J&J a ton of credit for moving very quickly. They agreed with me on the importance of acquiring Baby Center before E-toys went into Chapter 11 so that we could preserve Baby Center and its assets as best as possible. And so we came out of, you know, we avoided, you know, Baby Center avoided the near-death experience from that standpoint by finding a great home. And Baby Center actually did have a number of offers on the table. And the interesting thing was, you know, J&J wasn't the highest priced offer but from E-toys perspective it was all cash and from our perspective they were a great, again, a great values fit for Baby Center. So in my experience working with DCs I think one of the greatest experiences that I've had as far as you have the lesson of take the door when it opens is John Doar had made me the offer to come and be an executive in residence at Cliner Perkins whenever I was ready to leave Baby Center. And that okay, well that's great. And then he kept saying, well whenever you're ready, we're going to have this. And so I thought, okay, well, you know, I've never taken a little bit of time off. That might be a fun thing to go and do. So when I, it allowed me to do a nice transition out of Baby Center to get the organization, you know, in a good place. And then to go, have the opportunity to sit inside Cliner Perkins, which is great. And have the opportunity to sit in on pitch meetings, get opportunity to meet with a lot of companies in their portfolio. And I think the key for me in that experience was to really appreciate how hard that DC job is. How really hard it is, the volume of great business plans that they see on a regular basis. And you know, any given partner gets to pick one for the year. Right? I mean, you might see 50 a week. You might, you know, plans. You might see in person, five, ten, you know, different companies, different great entrepreneurial teams pitching their idea. And you have to choose among all of this, you know, who you're going to marry for the next ten years, because you're going to be on their board for the next ten years. You're going to keep, you know, involved in that company for the next ten years. And you get to make one of those choices a year. And so it's hard to choose among all those great ideas. And so I think it was, it was also helpful for me for being on the other, you know, the normal role being on the other side of the table to really also appreciate that, to appreciate that, you know, just the quality and caliber of things they say they see. And to be much more thoughtful than if you're going to be going out and raising money, who has a thesis in the area where you're working on? You know, who is focused in that area? Who has a history in that area? Who believes in the area that you're working on? Because if it's not something that's on the radar, it's harder, you know, to get in the mix. And I think that that was, that that was a great, a great experience that, and you realize, you know, you're running, you're running your company and you're realizing that you're a VC partner, right? They've got to go back and, you know, they want to, they got to go back to their partners and also justify your next round of funding, right? They have their, your partner. They, and they need, they have accountability back to their partnership for how well you're doing and how well the investment they made in you is doing. So I think there really is an alignment of, you know, goals. And I think it's, it's, I think a lot of times, you know, the entrepreneur needs to, you know, really understand what that investor side, how they're accountable, how they're measured, so you can make that partnership work as best as you can. When we raised the B round on Navigenics, we spent a lot of time thinking about who do we want to have come in as an investor? And we had Cliner Perkins and we had Sequoia already. And, you know, we were thinking about, well, who else could, you know, what other VC company could really, you know, did we think really interested personalized medicine well enough, who we would be really bummed if they went out and funded somebody else? And that was a big piece of what helped us target in on MDV, more Davidau, as a potential investor. They were, of course, excited about it based on their experience in this space. And for me, as a CEO, getting a great board member who had prior experience in running a company, who also was a woman, for me, as a woman CEO, I was very interested in another woman on the board, if we could find, you know, if we could find something that really fit. And so it was a great solution for me in getting, and you'll realize, people say this, people say, not everybody's money is the same. And you can get money from a lot of places. But you need to really think about that marriage that you're doing to who you're getting that money from. And really trying to maximize for the benefit of the company, for the support of you as a CEO, who you decide to choose to let invest in your company. And I think that it's important to think about it that way around. It's not just going out with your hat. It's your in charge. You're the CEO. Who do you really want to get money from? Yeah. You mentioned the idea of hiring a bestie for a step. You also mentioned building a culture or establishing a culture that you choose to make culture. You also mentioned in passing the building organization. And I was just wondering how you and your startup you can part of how do those three concepts look together? Yeah. I think for Swollen, so the question was in hiring, how do the concepts of hiring great people, building a culture and building an organization mesh together. I think first of all, in your hiring people, one of the things I've learned over time is there's a difference for me anyway in what I look for from individual contributors in an organization versus what I'm looking for in the leadership team and in a lot of management positions. So I think one of the keys as you grow up in a leadership role in the company is emotional intelligence can start to trump intellectual intelligence as a barometer of success. As you play a higher and higher leadership role in the company, your ability to motivate people, your ability to work cross functionally, your ability to get a team to follow you, even if they don't report to you, becomes more and more important and you're working through others doing less yourself. As an individual contributor, you find the brightest, hardest working people you can find and you hope that you can really grow and develop those people over time and invest in them. And I think that that's in for me, I think about hiring. I also, in building an organization is I look for complementary skill sets. I always think I always use the basketball team analogy of if there were all seven foot centers, you can't win if you're all six foot guards, you can't win either. You gotta have complementary skill sets, you gotta have people who know how to work as a team and cover each other and support each other. And that to me gets back to that relationship to a culture. If you have a culture where people are pushing each other, supporting each other and all in it together. I mean, again, it's like, we're all here to make the company successful. If it doesn't work in an organization, if one piece of the organization does a great job and the other pieces fall apart, you're not going to be successful in the end. And so I think that bringing those different skill sets, getting into work as a team is a core part of building that culture and being conscious about it. I do think the other thing, and as I mentioned in passing, I had the whole executive team read good to great. One of the things I've come to really appreciate over time is having a common lingo, having a common reference point, especially if you're building a company where you're hiring people, if you're bringing a whole management team with you somewhere and you've had a common past experience, then you've got that foundation. If you're pulling people together from different backgrounds, you need to create that common foundation. And something like sharing a book, going to a training seminar, being very clear and explicit about each other's backgrounds and what those belief systems are to help create that common lingo so that you can really talk and work together with a common foundation.
