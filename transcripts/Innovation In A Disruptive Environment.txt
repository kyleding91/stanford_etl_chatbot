 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader's series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. How many of you have heard of Steve Jefferson before? Oh good, within the rest of you get to know him this afternoon. He's really a tour to force. I'm not going to tell you about him other than Eddie. He was a co-term here. That was smart. And then he enjoyed coming to Stanford so much that he came back and got an MBA here as well. So he's been a student on all parts of the campus back in the 80s and 90s. But he's been a partner at Dreyper Fish in Jefferson for quite a while. And he's a returning to this seminar series. So we're happy to have him back. But what's really nice to announce is that there's his dad, Tony. The way, let's give his dad a round of applause. Thanks. Thanks for being a parent of one of our speakers. Nice to see you. Nice to see you. With that further ado, give a warm welcome back to campus to Steve Jefferson. Thank you, Tom. That's great. Thanks. Wow. This is overwhelming. I can't tell you how much of a surprise it is to see folks piled in the aisles along the way. That's why I'm not going to do that. I'm going to have a little chance to see some of you guys. I'm going to get back and apologize if it's uncomfortable. I'll try to speak quickly the loop time for questions and the shift you're way around. And maybe we can even shift some people into different chairs or something over time. As I feel bad about having to stand for an hour. So when I've been sort of hoping to talk about with you and share some thoughts as our perspective as a venture capital firm and as a practitioner of that art of what we're seeing in the entrepreneurial community. Because frankly, the thing I love most about my job is the daily meetings we have with entrepreneurs who are bold and fresh and set out to change the world in some meaningful way. sometimes they do, sometimes they don't, but we get the joy of learning from them. And in some ways, my job as a speaker is to integrate the best of what I've learned from them and some of the patterns we're seeing in technology trends and such in the industry. I'll try to just speak for maybe half the time, maybe the other half for questions if I can, because inevitably you're going to be interested in something that I didn't pre-anticipate. It is good to be back on campus. I have done three degrees here and I remember of course very much like this, vividly, during my undergrad days where they brought in parades of entrepreneurs and folks from community and it really helped connect with Silicon Valley and it's something I remember vividly and some glad to be part of that again today. So what I want to talk a little bit about is disruptive innovation. This is what startups do. It's different from other kinds of innovation, sustaining innovation if you've subscribed to Clayton Christensen view of life and technology accelerating change. In other words, the pace of change is being induced by technology and why that's particularly important in synergistic with what we do and what the entrepreneurs do. And then give some examples. I couldn't possibly cover them all as an adventure firm. We invest in a wide variety of industries and sectors. Some of the ones that interest us the most don't even have categories yet. They don't fit in a bucket. They don't fit in a category. They're unique ideas of one sort or another, but I'll give one example that maybe if some interest to anyone interested in information theory or life science as in this integration of the two. The re-engineering of the information systems of biology is one of these frontiers of the unknown. One of these exciting areas of future progress that I think warns a lot of attention. Certainly is getting a lot of it on campus and engineering sectors and one that excites us and myself. So just one slide on us for background. We're unusual in a couple ways. We're a very early stage focused venture fund, although there are several that do that. But more unusual is this federated network of funds we built around the world. Most recently announced today in Russia and a couple weeks ago a big expansion of our European operations. We're trying to build a network of venture funds across the planet that are cross-linked by equity ownership but not managed centrally. And so we can hopefully benefit from some of the role of DEX network benefits of partnering, introductions, resumes, deal flow information about markets and such. Yet not try to bog down with one big organization that's managing many offices. So that's an experiment and process we've been doing for about 15 years in this expansion mode and think we can scale the venture business in a way that can tap into entrepreneurs around the world, not just in Silicon Valley. I think I heard the audio cut in and out. Was that sounding okay for you? So okay. And I found out. So maybe I'll just mention in aggregate we have about six billion dollars under management but it's all in small pockets that are investing in startups. So there's no one fund that's a billion dollars for example. So topics. There are a lot of things a lot of change in the world. You see it in the news reflected in market share ships of companies, shorter lifespans of companies, shorter lifespans of countries and initiatives of technologies and products. And there's a lot of reasons for this. One of the fundamental drivers is technology and disruptive technology in general and it's all very synergistic with what entrepreneurs do day in and day out. So one of the main points I want to try to make today is that this pace of change is only accelerating and that entrepreneurs are the main drivers of it and that they are fundamentally themselves changing through a sort of mutually synergistic benefit both globalization and network effects that feed each other over the internet. So why is this important? I'm guessing it's of interest anyone who sort of is close to technology or technology business in their interests or futures but it also impacts the fate of nations. The way Singapore is going versus its neighbor Malaysia can largely be traced to teams as to how one taps into advances in the language of the digital era and now the genomics era. The entire fate of nations in context for our lives. It's going to change dramatically and has quite a bit so far. For what we do in our business of course it's very important that's why we pay attention to it but I think also just no matter who you are it's a fundamental cost for optimism. I think when you dwell on the pace of technology change it really cheers you up. So what do BC's look for? This one quick slide is probably obvious but this is the way we like to frame it. Almost every BC will tell you the first point. Passion entrepreneurs of course that's what you have to look for. This one's somewhat unique to us in other words I don't know if other venture firms emphasize the second bullet point as much as we do. We really try to find unique ideas not sure money makers not yet another great idea that fits in a framework of investment theses that we just roll out over and over again. We're really trying to make everyone our investments one of a kind and that gives you a lot of answer to benefits like debt verification and things of that sort. And of course they have to have both the desire and a plausible plan to change the world. Something bold something brash not just a you know arbitrage seeking opportunists looking to make a quick buck. A lot of these other things you hear about from venture capitalists are I think derivative from these core points and much of our strategy in tactics is a firm drive from one simple rule from a Catholicizing heard sense of simple rules that from which all strategy drives. But one of the things we really force to drop the technology so let me focus on that. Why is that? So I might ask a question to you why does the startup exist and why do venture firms exist? They are going up against daunting challenges right under capitalized no brand you know no market presence no prior customer relationships you know a startup company has everything stacked against them except for one thing usually there's something related to disruption if it weren't for this the startup wouldn't win if you had stasis stability and predictability in any given market you don't tend to see startups. And so it's sort of an obvious point but one that we like to focus on that if you don't have something disrupting the marketplace it's just going to be the big guys getting bigger right and so what are those some here's some examples of ones that we think of but most of these we can't really invest in in any given on sort of ongoing strategy like 10 years now 20 years now I couldn't count on most of these like structural changes in markets deregulation privatization right these were great opportunities when they come in certain economies are on the world but you can't count on the next one 20 years from now you know I couldn't predict what it might be even financial turmoil itself is a form of disruption it's kind of funny but some of the companies in our portfolio they're doing the best during the automotive industry right an industry that's just completely disrupted through financial turmoil and all kinds of interesting self-induced injuries on pension plans and what have you that allows the Tesla's of the world or even software companies that sell to auto dealers having a booming business right and it's usually some form of disruption allows the new entry to come in sometimes disruption come from new channels of distribution if you think of when Dell first entered competing with compact back when they were like resellers versus direct to consumer kinds of channels that were forming for for selling computers it was almost as if compacts fate was written on the wall insurance of Dell took the business and the franchise away from compact in those early days because of their ability to exploit a new channel distribution and if weren't for that you know just being yet another computer manufacturer didn't make the difference and all the other competitors of compact that were classic in the same business through the same channels didn't really have a good chance the internet's a class example of new channel distribution the most class sort of the largest disruption how you reach customers by channel I just mean what is the method by which a company reaches its customers through what intermediary to what sales channel internet's the biggest change in that that we've seen not sure what the next one is probably something to do with mobility but I can't predict what the one after that would be so again it's great when you find them but hard to predict a sustainable business why won't customers be around 50 years from now why would be around 100 years now not sure which of those I've counted this one I will count on every year every decade every century disruptive technology advances continue and they compound and they become more and more powerful so this is the one that really gets as excited it may have been in the noise but it kind of answers the question why do VCs focus on technology you know why are they doing so few retail deals or so many other parts of the economy that are you know service economies a bigger part of the economy than the goods or physical products and you know why are we and these weird niches and why is it seem so natural to us to do that and so unnatural to invest in other areas it's because this is where we we find this these disruptive dynamics to to gal to sort of go on to a lot of the advances tend to be interdisciplinary which is great when you're at school you can study many things and think about integrating innovations from one domain into another where the sort of stovepipe thinking within businesses within academic disciplines tends to isolate the thinking you know if you can be one of those cross-pollinator usually can think of a disruption that hadn't been thought of before and I might argue that most of the game-changing advances in science tend to come from left field not from the warmth of the center of the herd but from some unusual thinker outside of out of the box the changes are also non-linear it's very hard to make business predictions using straight lines and paper when the curves are exponential and I think that maybe fundamental lack of thinking lack of use of log paper and business to make this such a predictable advance for the new entrant like Apple entering the music business and taking the walkman franchise from Sony and you could have predicted flash memory prices and dish drive prices and seeing the point when the tape drive was going to disappear yet you know the incumbents just did nothing about it they somehow couldn't see that change that would inevitably occur in their business as it went digital so some examples of exponential curves historical one one of my favorites of course well going back to the internet boom but a markedly smooth curve of growth that the internet provided that was sort of a pure example of network effects what we can to call viral marketing where he did no traditional marketing any sort but the product propagated over the communication channels of humans in the way that they communicate with each other this case web based email for the first time group very rapidly acquired nice outcome for investors remarkably short period of time and by the way the product was built by one person three months jack Smith and caught our attention because these are the kind of things we'd love to invest in so we found another one but we didn't invest in this one came out of Israel I see you what was astounding is if you compensate for when they launched which were six months staggered but if you make the curves so the same they start the same access point it was the exact same pattern of growth you know they told two friends and so on and so on kind of like the old shampoo commercial from I guess it was the 80s so you probably don't remember that in any case it was a remarkable similar pattern made us think about what are the formulas driving by the marketing spread of products in buddy networks and such then these modeling crew came into the picture again speaking globalization does anyone know well before I get to the story let me go back does anyone know where hotmail was based where the company was headquartered oh man first right answer do you work there have you heard me say it before you talk okay usually someone says Bangalore or whatever they purposely chose free month because it's free email you want to watch a company from free month they were on Liberty Avenue in free month they launched in the fourth of July and of course that was all a big no PR whatsoever because no one was paying attention on the fourth of July so in any case now Estonia you know my homeland so I am biased but a small group of people they're built to product remarkably quickly that set new records for the pace of growth of a new product both because on the free music space before which could argue we said hey free music you know has been proven to grow quickly but then Skype was slightly more serious product that some of you may have heard of speaker here recently from Skype it's a remarkable story over a hundred million users and growing quite rapidly and recently spun out of eBay or at least in the process of being spun out of eBay so what's interesting about Skype is not just their shared growth but the fact that they built a brand in such a short period of time there was a question asked in this case 2005 what product has had the greatest impact on your life in the last year and it was an open-ended response form right people just fill in their responses and it's quite remarkable you know coming in out of nowhere is the third product behind Google and Apple again with almost no marketing budget whatsoever really caught our attention said something's new about the network economy there's something new about globalization and the interplay of both that these startups can come from anywhere and they can serve global customers day one in ways that we just couldn't do 10 20 years ago when I started in the business we invested in US companies primarily California serving US customers and we didn't worry about international customers until they're starting to go ready to go public around the time of filing your S1 you'd set up a joint venture in Japan and maybe one in Europe but as a venture capitalist that wasn't here in Forte wasn't something you were expected to be able to help companies with but now that's completely changed changing it even more is one of my favorite people Gordon Moore at least the eponymous law that is a scribe to him he likes to go salmon fishing out here in half one base of the photo I took him if I think all the photos in here ones I've taken just as an aside I love photography as a hobby and he is a wonderful guy and he came up with something called Moore's Law now I want to ask how many people have seen Ray Kurzweil's version of Moore's Law which is an abstraction of Moore's Law that goes back over 100 years oh come on are people being shot only two hands three wow this is actually one of the lowest response rates of any audience I've seen which is I don't understand what that means usually our investors like our LPs they don't read this kind of stuff but anyway I think it's the most important graph of all technology business in all history technology business and what is showing just to explain the logarithmic scale so a straight line on this would be exponential pace of growth the slightly up taking Kurzweil argues as a double exponential where you're looking not at how many transistors on a chip but how many calculations per second you can buy for a thousand dollars because nobody buys transistors right until they care about transistor count Moore as a co-founder of Intel certainly cared about it people buy computation storage and either way you graph it you get this remarkable curve that transcends anyone technology so the sort of colored bands are integrated circuits discrete components vacuum tubes relays mechanical devices the dots are the sort of price performance leaders of their day so there may be other you know companies that fill or products that fill the graph below it this is the frontier of human computational capacity it says a lot of interesting things first what does that mean you know they're deep cosmological questions and all kinds of you know evolutionary arguments one can make about how we use our technology to build our tools and so on and so forth and and and where might this head over by the way if it goes for just another 25 or 50 years and a thousand dollars buys you more computational power than all human brains on earth combined which kind of you read some staggering points of this continues it also begs the question what the next technology platform would be you know molecular electronics or nanotech or spent trionics or quantum computing beyond the integrated circuit doesn't have to be CMOS silicon as we've known it something you may take over but most importantly of all at least from a source of optimism and and interest is that there seems to be absolutely no coupling to the economy right so these companies may have come and gone but the great depression all the recessions world or one world or two have had no many McPlanet on the trajectory progress of innovation and technology which is astounding these really stop and let us think in the middle of this economic recession you might think oh innovation dries up and it doesn't right within university labs it's just booming like crazy the companies that take advantage of that may have pent up demand and maybe more pent up disruption to take advantage of when you finally do come out with a new product or service but the pace of human innovation I believe continues unabated and is exogenous to the economy pretty cool now what are some reasons why people seem to have a hard time taking this into their business planning well here's one graph this is historical on purpose during the internet boom time where if you just took in this case number of internet hosts or web servers out there on a logarithmic scale you'd see this particularly uninteresting curve the way scientists would plot it if you take the exact same set of data points but plot it the way newspapers would report it it looks like that and so the way they tell the story is I didn't know where the internet exploded in the scene here well why let's look back to what was going on here oh net scapes IPO that must have been what it was right around this time period or when you add a few more data points and shift the near the curve because there's no need the curve when it's plotted you know on this kind of paper the near the curves just an illusion based on some random choice of axes when you plot it this way you know time passes and then all said in his Google saying well you know it's us that made a difference in the pace of growth and it's always history is told by those who are a couple years after the inflection point of the random curve you have to draw at the time and when they're never the first mover right there's no such thing as first mover advantage in technology it's just whoever wins says they were first and they redefined the market as such and Steve Jobs was classic at that great stories in Q&A if you want okay for those of you who weren't interested in IT realize that all these accelerating curves of change are not special to IT so sure they occur in all these areas quite dramatically but they also occur in life sciences in ways that are less well appreciated and not fully understood Dickerson not well known but he actually was more accurate in his prediction in 1965 about something fairly mundane about number of proteins that had been crystal instruction which will be deduced over time or determined over time rather and he's been accurate till I think less than half percent to the current day which is quite remarkable now what's an example that's maybe topical and relates to the information knowledge or embedded content of the entire sort of life sciences and genomics revolution could be the number of genes that are sequenced it's just one proxy happens to be the one we have the most data on so it's nice to plot it here's what it looked like leading up to the sequencing of the human genome leg by Craig Banner and then a competitive government effort as well and you might say well gosh wouldn't that be the pinnacle of accomplishment when we just you know kick back for the next 10 years and digest all that information that came out of the human genome project and oh by the way you know a lot of stories were told about how you know 90% of the project was completed in the last year which is exactly what you'd expect with these kinds of curves so you might say where does it go next well it's interesting here's just five more years of data so that last curve ends here and it just keeps going what are these people doing what are they sequencing what what is all this data that's being dumped in the public archives and would it continue I mean how could taking this to the current day what would you just go off the chart and sure enough one team again Craig Banner has grown this data set tenfold in the last two years how do you do that well he realized there's microbes everywhere it's not a big insight and this is going to be a segue to some of the industrial biotech 2.0 stuff that we're investing in and kind of excited about there's a lot of microbes out there a ton of it in the in the sea water every time you get a little gulp of sea water you're swallowing every milliliter millions of bacteria and viruses and they're incredibly diverse and there's a lot of them out there and oh by the way they make up the majority of those biomass in fact most of the cells in your body are bacterial and if you look at unique DNA 99% of the unique DNA in your body is bacterial so 90% of the cells 99% of the DNA you're kind of a as I call it a big bag of microbes so what are these things oh by the way you can't digest certain metabolites in your bloodstream only come to bacterial channels the human body is unable to produce them yet they're throughout our body there's all kinds of synergies we just barely understand of how microbes give us life so what what Venter did is the best boondoggle ever financed by Gordon Moore and the Department of Energy went on a sailboat around the world and Polynesia Fiji you know all these great destinations and sampled sea water about every 200 miles and ran it through his gene sequencing techniques he had the insight that he thinks computational power again Moore's law had reached the point the threshold where we don't even have to distinguish the organisms in an ecosystem just when the entire ecosystem through the shotgun sequencing methodology where you blast the DNA into random fragments have the computers try to put it all back together again right that's why I was his insight that let him win the human genome sequencing project people said it couldn't be done computers caught up prediction of Moore's law hit right the right time and boom make it synthesize the genome on the human project so similarly with ecosystems just put the whole ecosystem through don't even care where the organisms came from what which one came from one or another and figure out what are all the genes that exist out there and this is how he's grown by about a hundredfold the number of known genes involved energy transduction so taking energy from the sun and harvesting for various uses within the cell these organisms in the ocean have evolved over longer periods of time than plant land-based plants and animals and they're much more efficient than the photosynthesis we know of on land so only he found immense biodiversity for the colleges in the room he found that sometimes in the open ocean between successive samples the biodiversity was 85% different be like tundra and and arctic and rainforest in terms of biodiversity in the microbial populations now why would you do this well it turns out the pace of progress in synthesizing genes is growing faster than the pace of reading them so writing the code of life is advancing this is again totally different and uncomparable scales of just the slopes you can compare Moore's law is growing roughly at the same as gene sequencing or gene reading but gene writing is growing at a much higher slope and the insight the aha of enter had was I don't really need to have the source of organism anymore one of the fundamental insights was up in tennival in biotech you had to cut and paste from living organisms right you had to take DNA from something you could find and insert into something else you want to make more of it you had to find the host organism from what you came today you just send a email file all right to about actually about 20 different places around the world the email file they FedExU the DNA no animals are involved just give me a tgccac you know you used it's code one of the first things synthesize polio a few years back part of the stunt viruses are small caught people's attention they've made polio from scratch in a lab and none of the people contributing to DNA even was being done which is a little bit of a problem bacteria is much larger venture has done that this year and is about to boot up the first synthetic organism or first artificial life form where the DNA did not come from any animal he's shown that you'd take 100% of the DNA out of one organism put it into another and change that animal sort of alchemy if you will in the genetic codes there's different as mice and man now these are microbes single cell organisms but nevertheless a whole cell change of phenotype from swapping out 100% of the DNA has been shown so the idea is that you'll usher in a new era a synthetic biology the wonderful professor recently joined Stanford ground floor of the Y2E2 building drew Andy he before that was involved with starting by Jim the International genetic engineer machines competition where children teenagers in called in children does a teenager's basically compete globally to build microbes that do interesting things little flashing units the first thing that is make them smell better you know because you call I smells like a place from which it comes and so they made a smell like bananas and you know that was a first step others use it to as an arsenic detector the winning teams were from Peking University in Slovenia this year and one of them was pretty cool it created a biofilm that reacted to light and then it sort of changed color so it was literally a photographic plate with resolution greater than that of normal film and you could expose it and get an image so it's kind of like an E. colorey if you call that so if you don't know to get to know these great ground floor of Y2E2 so what is this new era this new sort of example of just just groundbreaking change if you're not in this domain it and you get exposed to the first time it usually makes your jaw drop especially the computer scientists is that in a sense they're treating life as suffer and building organisms scratch application cassettes that they would insert into these aesthetic cells and static chromosomes and the cool thing is the software builds on hardware because these are living to be producing organisms and you can then also use directed evolution or basically evolution in a lab where you select the fastest growers by some criteria and do in a sense artificial evolution you make a big advantage a dramatic a found much bigger advantages through artificial evolution than purposeful design kind of point it and the applications of course are in some pretty big markets that are in dire need of change to get off the petrochemical economy so let me give you concrete examples of how that business might work first as an abstract level what would you do you make these cells that make products from waste feedstocks or directly from CO2 in some of the most interesting cases and oh by the way it's catching attention of a lot of people this I grab this frame grab from a video this morning so Obama just gave the National Medal of Science to a cragventer earlier today and about a couple of weeks months ago next on mobile did a $600 million dollar well between 300 600 depending on how you do the math investment so 300 into synthetic genomics 300 of other investment co investment into algae based fuels and what they're doing is producing fuels you can run in your cars and jets directly from CO2 and water and sunlight and they're getting them to excrete directly across the cell membrane so you don't have to kill and harvest in batch mode the algae but you just continuously secrete across the cell membrane which is an important advance on the separation cost of all that and what are the things you can do with these microbes well it turns out they they naturally love to chew up coal at least there's groups of it groups of them to do it naturally occurs about 10% or natural gas comes from this source where deep underground microbes and aerobic microbes are chewing up coal stripping electrons and producing methane so you can convert the dirtiest most expensive to extract of the fossil fuels into the cleanest burning easiest to extract you burn natural gas at home without even a few so it's it has almost no no noxious byproducts so what I want to do is understand you know what are these microbes work how can we enhance it how can we convert coal to natural gas without ever digging up the coal in the first place and when the first sample they went down in the sand one basin they drilled down into a pocket of water that was sitting under there and it had been detached from the rest of the world for over 70 now estimates are about a hundred million years according to carbon dating and there's an entire ecosystem of organisms living off each other no sunlight no exposure to air whatsoever almost like a genetic time capsule from the past and remarkably efficient at what they do so the business opportunity there is to you know understand what they eat what catalyst might improve their performance what consortia of these naturally occurring organisms not genetically modified because this could be a curclaw to get ice-9 scenario if you made it too efficient but you want to that's only for the science fiction buffs you basically want to think about how you could enhance the way biology is doing what it already does naturally around the world so what's another example how can we get rid of the multi-billion dollar fingers of hanging off the petrochemical industries kind of depressing that 90 percent of all of organic chemicals so your pamper your your toothbrushes your plastics they all of course come from oil and right now they go through crackers both catalytic and heat generated processes and ideally we'd like to swap it for something where you use sugar waste CO2 things that sort of occurred into fuels and kept in plastics so let me just give you one example of that that's been worked on this year in quite a bit of progress is made by a little company called genomatica it's in a niche called butane dial you know I'm all again a multi-billion dollar market one of many so you just one little specialty niche of the petrochemical industry so you used to make spandex so you know for those of you worrying about the future of spandex it soon will be green as well as a bunch of carbony parts but here's what's really cool about it no organism on the planet makes butane dial right so there's no plant or animal that makes it right and so what the company did is they used the computational screening model to explore all possible pathways that could get you from sugar to that and they explored 40 thousand different pathways and figured out optimally looking at the carbon utilization what does it what do we think is going to be the best way to get the product we want from from sugar then they engineered purposeful design if you well a way to get from A to B through a series of intermediate steps all within a single organism and within its metabolic process but then it did something very clever they crippled the organisms redundant pathways of survival so the only way this organism can live and reproduce and have a life nice long you know life and produced children is if it makes more the chemical you want as a byproduct so all the other redundant pathways were knocked out with a bunch of gene knockouts so that in its own you know ATP cycle of how it lives and how it harvots energy it will make more the chemical you want in in so doing what you then the reason you do this is that rather than having your organism evolve away from what you want you then just screen the fastest growers picking off whoever's growing fastest put them in a new bath pick off the fastest growers put them in a new vessel and so on and you get improvement way beyond human design so they got about a 20 fold improvement of you know just using human smarts to go from the initial organism that did an okay job when they inserted the gene pathways to maybe a 20 fold improvement and then last year they've had a 20,000 fold improvement through artificial evolution just saying we don't know how it's doing it but if we just keep skimming the fastest growers making more and more and more the chemical we want so it reminds me of something I read in a software book the closing chapter of Denny Helles' book pattern on the stone the greatest achievement of our technology maybe the creation of tools that allow us to go beyond engineering that allows to create more than we can understand and I think that's pretty profound he was thinking of a software context which I think in artificial intelligence neural networks in a variety of other areas that's absolutely the future of I think how these systems we built and I think it's the future of complex systems development in general that the design engineered purposeful approach is going to seed way to more of an out of control biologic process in both literal sense and in the metaphorical sense and how we build systems and software so what might that mean and sort of driving towards some sort of closure on this point interesting intersection where what we're formally discrete domains of information science and life sciences are cross-pollinating in very interesting ways both the tools from one are being used in the other the lessons learned in one or across-pollinating to the other how can we build a better neural network model we're looking of course to better models of the brain itself and so each of these fields is driving each other in a learning doing cycle it's it's quite remarkable and there's a lot of all kinds of random places you wouldn't imagine like using a molecule similar to chlorophyll to make organic memory chips that you know compete with flash memory one day and are you know incredibly small much much smaller than anything we build today and you just sort of splash and rinse as your manufacturing step instead of a you know high energy physics process in in the current fabs today and so there's some pretty interesting cross pollinations and reading of these ideas across formally discrete domains so now I showed Rick Kurzweil's version of Moore's Law and a couple other his sort of accelerating curve charts and if anyone reads one of his books you'll see page after page after page of these accelerating changes going on in technology he had an interesting summary take away that you can sort of easily remember and this is true in perpetuity meaning it'll be true 20 years from now as it is today but if you look for 20 years to the future you'll see how it's much technology advancement as the past hundred and that's pretty profound if you think back to like 1909 anyone remember that I don't right but in America right if you were born in the early 1900s you were born at home without electricity without they're not in the hospital you probably didn't graduate high school you know society has changed dramatically in the last hundred years largely during my technology and the vectors along education and social equity and to think that not as much change certainly by no means I mean human nature is glacial and it doesn't change from the year to year but the drivers of comparable change think about all economics revolutions think about what's happened the last hundred years with birth control and then the next hundred years and genetically modified organisms it's going to be pretty how should I put attention will arise between human nature and the pace of change but I think some near-term implications are the forecast horizons are shorter and shorter you know predicting next quarter is going to be as difficult as predicting next year an idea of a hundred year business plan as as absurd as it ever was and soon will be the one year business plan will get more absurd and that you have perpetual future shock every but I used to think oh it's that young generation that's using computers or whatever that's because the pace of change was going through a sort of generational 20-year gap soon it'll be oh you know you were the class in 90 oh shit yeah everything's changed right in certain scientific disciplines certainly feels that way and that idea that the future keeps changing faster than keep up with it I think we'll only accelerate and that relates to things like black swan events a great book by Nicholas Talib out of Lebanon I highly recommend it and he comes at it more from an econometric point of view or economist point of view that says the future is increasingly driven by unpredictable events things that in retrospect made sense but at the time no one predicted it and as a venture firm we try to take advantage of that right we try to invest in things that most people think are crazy ideas it's kind of just a statement and if we're we don't strive for consensus when we invest in deals we will allow a passionate minority to outweigh a blah majority all right so a couple people that really want to do a deal can outvote like five that don't and the reason is because no good idea that changes the world is universally regarded as one at its outset so Google hot male skype oh my gosh the list goes on eBay we're generally laughed at by most venture capitalists when they're trying to raise their first round of capital they were ridiculed I know they were now you won't get that opinion today in retrospect we all change a story oh yeah I really tried to get that deal I almost got that deal I would have been in that deal it was brilliant I was all over it but at the time they laughed at it so you know the ones that the companies that really do change the world and I would this maybe is a sort of source of encouragement for the entrepreneurs with an idea if everyone thinks your idea is good it's probably not a big idea if most people think idea is bad that's great as long as you find somebody who thinks it's a good idea if 100% of people and you've sampled widely think it's a bad idea probably it's bad I don't know that one for you be sure but it might be a safe but if you find you know like one to 10 ratio one person likes it 10 hated that's perfect as long as you respect the one person I mean if it's just the village he had like everything okay so I don't know if we'll spend time in this but they're all kinds of weird things I mean if you might think computing is done and you know hardware is kind of on its trajectory there are some weird experiments going on in the periphery of science with quantum computers that could change everything where they literally engage parallel universes to compute in a way that is unlike any computing done today and could scale in ways that are unfathomable some of the physicists out of Oxford and elsewhere have predicted that on the curve that this company dewey of is on and there's arguments as to whether they're really quantum computers so let's put some caveat there but if the quantum computers progress on a curve like some people are forecasting they might that will soon have computers in the next 10 or 15 years that exceed the computational power of all classical computers ever built and that could ever be built if all the matter of the universe was converted into classical computers that's mind-bending I'll just leave it at that so um one of two more points before leaving on a completely different topic but I just want to throw it out there in case the Q&A someone wants to talk about you know the investment business instead of the entrepreneurial business we've noticed this pattern and it's not very well vetted so if someone in the audience can shoot holes in this I'd be very interested but a weird pattern also named venture capital private equity meaning think about buyouts and mergers and these you know people that write really big checks and then venture capital starting to businesses punctuated by recessions that all seem to have these seven to ten year cycles um and the only way we like it is it would predict if history is any guide that we're now in a venture capital so it's a good fundraising slide but other than that I just not really sure why it's true other than long waves uh and feedback loops that any dynamic system with a long path to feedback tends to oscillate so i d bank capacity planning all these things to oscillate over the um cycle time of feedback loops and the feedback loops of venture capital private equity are really slow and so the seven the ten year cycle kind of makes some sense as to when the inflows and outflows of capital occur in our business but maybe we're on an uptick what would it be well here you know is the you know the mini computer uh you know here wait when we get this right now sort of the mini computer the person no where am I mini computer personal computer internet you know maybe energy clean tech um a lot of great companies were founded in down markets great recessions rep depressions um a lot of great brands people starting companies during these time periods tend to be passionate about what they're doing they tend to focus on customers more than investors like he'll packered focusing on Disney is it early customer and they tend to build cultures that scale and that last they aren't just out again on a money or land grab mentality they're really building businesses the way you'd want to see them built so we've generally found that some of the best companies you know the Microsoft and I know like Microsoft but some of the long lasting companies I Microsoft and he'll packered and then such we're started in down markets so one might one of those upticks that we look for i'm not going to spend time in the slide I'll leave it for QNAT if it isn't interested but it may be obvious to all that there's a lot of excitement on energy and clean tech not just because of public recession geological forces and market sizes and trillion dollar opportunities uh instead of billion which is what we usually look for you have a lot of tech innovation nanotech biotech and frotech all feeding into it and most importantly people like it right it's you're cool again with your kids if you're working in this field right so management flocks to it students flock to it all over the place you feel good about what you do at work and some of the best human talent and innovative ideas come from that human talent influx and so if for no other reason than marketing you're going to see a lot of advances in energy and clean tech and we've been investing quite a bit in it than about 40 investments here out of this office and 73 across the network we started an energy generation this sort of in time and I'll say you think about a sequence um this smart grid storage is really important right now a lot of efficiency we're investing more and more on that end unusual things like agriculture where you can double up the DNA in a plant so having four parents instead of two and a polyploidal organism you get sort of the uber version of the plant and it grows bigger faster stronger and and the more disease resistant less recessive genes are expressed so that's kind of a fun one and then a whole bunch of synthetic biology companies and water purification is an area that we're really excited about so any of you that have breakthroughs in water purification maybe coming out of the left field like like I got to imagine something going on in regenerative medicine building artificial kidneys and the membranes for an artificial kidney for dialysis would one day perhaps create a sustainable um maybe solar driven adaptive membrane for water purification something different than reverse osmosis forward osmosis distillation of usual techniques okay second the last slide um basically you know what have I tried to convey we're seeing more innovation than ever before it's globalizing and it's great the entrepreneurs are everywhere opening up human talent pool and moving a lot of the friction and barriers to good ideas serving markets and those customers the flip side are also everywhere so you can tap into much bigger opportunities sooner as a startup and these network effects are you know mutually reinforced by the internet so we think that all that rolls into an incredible renaissance of learning so if you're a student of these subjects it's really exciting time to be in the lab uh especially in synthetic biology area or the industrial biotech two-point-no area and that this perpetual driver disruption technology in one way or another it's a great cyclone for nerds and so when you think about starting companies ask yourself why couldn't why is it now that this business can exist and couldn't have existed 10 years ago if there's not a good answer it's probably not a great company to start and is there something about technology trends that makes it better and better as time goes on and we think bottom lengths great time to build new companies so with that let me switch to Q&A uh if I may and I'm happy to talk about anything I spoke about here or anything completely unrelated yes we're gonna switch up of course to do the first question they know up the general panel oh sorry yeah absolutely one second of course hello my name is uh tom heimor I'm subbing in for a Steve blank I'm not sure this is actually working everyone here me all right so I'm subbing in for Steve blank on the MSN278 course which wraps around this and we kind of discuss the companies and the people that come and we actually have the great pleasure of having Steve join us for a few minutes after this lecture as a plug for those of you thinking about the class and the winter we wanted to I wanted to jump in here with an entrepreneurship focus question and ask what do you see as the most common mistakes that entrepreneurs make we saw some of what you think the great characteristics are what do you see is some of the common failures the common critical mistakes there's a lot of different mistakes let me think uh like what's common see one of the um I'm trying to think of do I want to filter for the common mistakes we see in our portfolio that's already passed through a filter of we decided to invest in it and so there's a sample selection bias up to that um did we induce the problems or uh or do we have a weird filter what we look for um let me start in a roundabout way and see if I can get to an answer if I start percolating on something the first thing to jump to mine had to do with people because there's huge diversity in markets and and I'm not sure if there's a generalizable lesson across all industries is to you know here's how you want to think about your business but when it comes to human dynamics they tend to be uh the same across all companies and oftentimes there can be a um a sort of a control problem with the founding DNA of a firm so I've noticed that a lot of great firms tend to have a pair of founders as a minimally minimally sufficient set uh the jobs in the wise in the act the severe and jack at hot mill you know there's a dynamic duo almost everywhere and even some of the companies that have a very strong cult personality like Larry Ellison there was Bob Miner you know behind him and Paul Allen Tibb Bill Gates um and I wonder if there's something about the best firms in having a marketing skill set and engineering skill set not having a single person that shares both those in the extreme and that if there's sort of a mutual respect in the founding team that says you know you do what you do well and I do what I do well and from the very beginning we've bifurcated responsibilities and roles then that tends to scale better versus the cult of the CEO that says you know I'm in charge this is my company and everyone I hire works for me and I kind of know how everything works that doesn't scale as well um and so one of the classic you know all these scaling mistakes occurs when a company reaches the point where it has more employees than the average tribe evolution early did you don't know the name of everyone in your firm anymore anymore and then all kinds of managerial you know headaches in suit so coming back to the founding in the early days I think you know it's an old adage that you know A managers hire A plus teams you know and a B manager hires a C team I mean you've heard before but it's really true that if you don't have enough self confidence to be humble and you're too much of an egotist you're gonna you know feel threatened by people who challenge your authority and you want to show the higher the best and brightest of what they do and the whole thing just sort of doesn't work as well so we try to find entrepreneurs who have that humility to expose their concerns you know and say here's what we think we got it nailed but here's what we really don't know it the answers I mean to help there's all kinds of other mistakes um you know in shifting market trends the classic example of course is just you know can you forecast well enough and see the pattern on the wall of when you need to downshift or or or or upshift your business growth um there are a lot of businesses that have stumbled unnecessarily because they they sort of didn't have the gyro of their business set right to the to the to the pace of customer action the other um I guess related point that was alluded to in down markets is you know it's really important not to mistake customers for investors um or a vice versa I think you're investors your customer um if you can especially in down markets find a customer to finance your growth it's going to be a much healthier way to grow your business then continually going back to you know outside sources of capital some businesses need it more than others but in the energy clean tech space there's some that are really capital intensive on the front end long before they have any feedback from the market so you know what we love to see is fast feedback cycles products release cycles you know software is a service that was one of the big advantages of it um and in a lot of other areas if if you don't sort of have to build it and then hope it's successful it's going to be a much better way to build a business and so to extent you can architect for pivot when do you actually start in a face of customers it's one of the reasons games is such a bad business to invest and you don't know if it's good till you've really polished the product to know if the gameplay is compelling uh you know a mockup usually doesn't do the trick so um there's certain sectors we don't invest in because of that feedback cycle I you I know maybe I'll come back to it if I can think of a better answer later sure okay sure um what was your favorite classic standard? what was my favorite classic Stanford which undergrad uh I did three gosh the one that jumps to minus touchy-feely uh as it's affectionately called as a business school where you you do uh psychotherapy group therapy basically masquerading as a class and as an engineer that was the most in sort of enlightening of how detached I was from my emotions and how uh how other people who had different thinking styles weren't really freaks but just really had different thinking styles and that was eye-opening for me having you know gone through much of my life with a different set of use um uh and I'm saying that someone jokingly but I honestly did think that you know the pessimist is just you know kind of a you know bizarre life form you know why would you ever work with a pessimist um uh things like that so but uh there were a lot when I was an undergrad I really liked all the classes I took outside my major so I remember professor Romo Hart's class under on networks in the psychology department and I tried whatever I could do to get as many classes outside my major which was electrical engineering um as I could and those are the ones I remember much much more the only things I really remember from W. Classes were some of the professors and students I met uh and some of the projects but not like oh yeah uh E 102 oh yeah you know that was a great one um uh uh is that home yeah cool yeah well make your decision to stop an engineer and become a venture capitalist well yeah for certain personality types for the like short attention span crowd um in the ADD folks oh sorry when did I decide to shift from engineering to venture capital and is it more fun was that the reason um so the the trajectory of my career was somewhat of a random walk of the sort of successive exposures so when I was a double EA I was working a Heel Packard in the seed program doing work study work study I went over a long period of summers doing ship design at Heel Packard and thought I wanted to be an engineering manager because it within that framework and that cocoon of sort of promote from within and lifetime employment which was espoused at the time it was a long 20 year cycle you become an engineering manager it seemed like they had a lot more influence on the world than than the engineers whose products might be canceled at any given moment and I just it was very naive I was very new nothing about business um and I thought well gosh how could I you know accelerate that 20 year path and so I thought I kind of somehow find a way to get the business goal and as an engineering that was the only sort of career planning that I had my life um how can I get the business goal because that could be a segue somehow to being an engineering manager and so when I was leaving I was starting a PhD program here in WWE but didn't uh complete it uh I was about two quarters into it um I shifted gears entirely and went to a management consulting firm Bain & Company it's a firm that my dad had exposure to and I never knew anything about consulting firms and they must have thought I was remarkably naive and charming when I interviewed and I didn't even know who the biggest company in the firm was McKenzie you know in the industry had never bought it and applied there um and I only applied the Bain because that's the only one I knew of um and so I worked there for three and a half years but that worked out really in an interesting and fortuitous way I was working across a variety of different high tech clients I expressed the desire to only work on high tech companies and I saw all kinds of patterns you know almost like case studies as we do in business school of vignettes of let's say a merger and acquisition situation or a new product introduction or a company going under or you name it um usually brought in by the CEO as a special ops team sort of work on some crisis these were opportunity to do sure and that did the one thing that worked according to plan is that did get me into business school um so that went according to plan but then it was a random walk I thought in business school by that point I was saying maybe product marketing would be what I want to do I started to get the sense I didn't really want to go back to engineering quite the same way and so I worked on my summer jobs at business school at apple and next I wanted to see Steve jobs in action as your childhood heroine and um and that was a trip um and and I wasn't really sure that was for me there I wasn't entirely sure and it was a big economic incentive to go back to bay because they were going to pay for all the business school um in fact it did and I owed them all the money back if I didn't go back to bay and so that was sort of the default and I was cruising into my second year of business school and then I got a call out and nowhere from a venture capitalist from Greylock uh friend former Bane um colleague of mine who said coming out to the west coast and interviewing would you like to interview and I was like okay and and then I did just die if I spoke to every student they were the most helpful and professors they were also quite helpful to knew anything about an entrepreneur capital this was before the internet really percolated to any of those industries there was no way to literally learn about what the venture industry was and the difference between the firms but I just did a deep dive of interviews and they were informational to start because I just kept getting turned down again because I didn't know what I was doing and to make a long story short I um finally found a group who was called draper associates time that was very unlike the others it was much more of a playful camaraderie and almost um tracing of the founders personality um a very uh different feel from the white shoe conservative model that I'd seen so many other places and so I did join there and and um at the time before I joined I thought okay I love technology from the consulting gig I like diversity more than depth I like to learn throughout my life and somehow my brain just clicks more on learning horizontally than being the master or something uh in great detail and so that has played out and that were even more finely cut in a way than at the consulting firms in terms of you know time slices of attention and and what we focus on but we can stay on the frontiers of the unknown and and and with the entrepreneurs we invest in try to find those ideas that are really cutting edge that's what we're supposed to be doing and so that's fine because um it just really makes it fascinating yeah and I don't think of myself as a banker when I was a business school uh I don't think I took any accounting or economics or finance classes that whole thing borders me to tears I don't use excel at work I mean I love excel I do my expensive parts uh my taxes in excel so I use it but I have no use use for it at work um so it's just gives a sense it's very different kind of work than banking or other types of finance making intuitive judgments on markets and people cool isn't it is that good okay sure so I yeah yeah yeah what kind of profile do you look for a when hiring a venture associate it's where firm so the question is what do we look for profile wise when we're hiring someone at our firm let's see I can give you a specific answer for a firm but then also try to generalize a bit to firms because there's a lot of good venture firms and they vary um we look for you know smart flexible reminded people that are different from others we've hired so we try to diversify our skill sets and backgrounds we look for people to have you know a deep role in the acts of contacts and such but we also look for that that self confidence to be humble point I was making with regard to entrepreneurs that we do look for that in the people we hire as well because even though there can be a lot of big egos floating around in this industry it could be a barrier to learning I think if you think you have the answers you come in with the game plan as opposed to a spirit of lifelong learning frankly so um I think they're but I'm gonna give a caveat and this this capital plight all firms including ourselves um whenever you ask that question of anyone in the venture business but maybe in any business um notoriously in the venture business you'll hear an answer that sounds remarkably like the person speaking and the people who really don't have good self-awareness we'll say and that's what you have to have and that's the only way to be successful venture capitalist so I can't tell you how many times when I was getting into you know interviewing getting into this field I'd hear these definitive statements like if you haven't been an entrepreneur how could you be a VC or if you haven't had 10 years of operating experience how could you be a VC and those and other contradictory statements we made by partners in the same firm which was remarkable and then um I might point out in my cover letter we'll notice that the people who are like the most senior partners at Excel at benchmark and oh can I give a long list haven't had more than a summer job of operating experience in their life you know how do you affect your that in you know there's no answer and everybody got a call back from any of those firms um so the only traction I got were people who were themselves consultants because that was my biggest you know member consulting business school VC that was the thing on the top of my resume stack you know those only people has plenty of attention to me so that homophily biases is called and recruiting is very strong amongst firms that have no processes in the WHR department or you know managerially a mess like every venture firm so so therefore you know your best bet is find someone like yourself you know on the web that you can you send the letter into um but there is variety you have people have come from the recruiting backgrounds legal backgrounds although god almost annoying um oh gosh there's all up in the map engineers marketers uh there tend to be a ton that have come from Stanford Harvard Business School so there is a overt I think bias and you know I don't know that it's so much the simplicity of saying oh that's you know where we hired from it's just there's no HR department or process so imagine a firm said hey send resumes it be overwhelming who's gonna read the resumes so what eventually firms do they're like how everybody you're not hiring and then you know when you do want to hire someone said you know anyone and literally hire someone that's a friend of somebody who's ready at the firm so like almost everyone in our firm pivoted off of somebody else that we knew right and I was one of the few exceptions my resume was over the transum and the only other exception is Jennifer Fonsdad who came through this program called the Coffman program which is a great way to get into and they purposefully focused on breaking down this this hiring bias where if you only hire it from your friends those networks tend to be pretty insular and how can we get my diversity in the in the venture business and then looping back we believe is a firm that's essential if you want to um get the wisdom of crowds and not have group think in a partnership dynamic you want as much diversity in the ideas coming in as possible um and so we try to we try to do that but it's hard when you don't have an HR department cool the back row how would you compare your role as a venture capitalist to that of a serial entrepreneur so somebody is starting a bunch of companies yeah what do you mean by how would I compare it like what's similar as a venture capitalist you are in the companies that you help build rather than the entrepreneur with the idea and that building the team got questions how would I compare or contrast the venture job to a serial entrepreneur in the degree of involvement in particular okay very different and I think any venture capitalist who thinks they're similar is either going to be very unhappy as a venture capitalist or very painful to the companies they invested because it is not an operating job right being on the board of a startup at best your mentor coach and cheerleader right you are not calling the shots you are not saying what the business should do you're not in control you live vicariously through the successes of your portfolio of investments and you can cheer them on but at the end of the day the entrepreneurs deserve all the credit for building their business and those few on to vcs rather this fuse vcs that confuse that point tend to come from the deep operating backgrounds right some some of the best ones don't but there are a few that sort of burn out in this industry pretty quickly and are very frustrated and they're having a transition just from a you know 10 years of operating experience into board member role and realizing it's very different so EIR for those who don't know entrepreneur in residence or serial entrepreneur are people who sort of are in the sort of habit of starting one business after another so they may not be as committed to anyone business they start because they intend to start a lot of them and so perhaps driving the question was well maybe that's kind of similar to being a vc but I think it's actually very different because if you're in the trenches you know you're really responsible for the product the service launching it everything it's a very different kind of feel okay cool yeah one more okay sure so you had a really interesting point where you said a smaller really passionate people can always find the rest of the investors so how do you sort of define that it can help with the process is do you have a place to measure the apples yeah hmm it's the only question I'm a little hesitant to because it's something we're kind of like if we had any trade secret that's kind of it um like an off-sites we spend most of our time talking about our voting processes and when we made a small change like does it take like we thought for example that it would be a brilliant idea to have three oh sorry something just cut out move just move oh who knew um this is a local dead spot um if we had three partners that would all had to be passionately in support of a deal and would vote a five on a one-to-five scale where you can't vote a three so you have to make a decision which way you're leaning strongly supportive strongly opposed mildly supportive mildly opposed uh if you had to have three fives and oh why any one of those three be willing to take a board seat as a pre-qualifier to getting a deal done we thought that would generate a very instant dynamic of the way the conversations go how you schedule meetings the pace at which we can invest and we thought it would accelerate things and actually slow the pace investment down dramatically versus having five partners the ideal for a variety of reasons so as a preamble we've tweaked so many different things the the short version is what we found most successful is you know everyone gets a vote narrowly equal votes of course you have to vote at the exact same time so the key for not having group think is you can have you know one strong voice say I'm a five and then other people vote it's like okay one two three everyone show your hand at the same time so that you expose minority opinions more easily um so there isn't any that kind of overt pressure even though generally speaking we don't respond much to that overt pressure we all laugh at each other more than to the line nevertheless uh you know it's an important parameter if you didn't do that everything would fall apart and um and we do just a simple voting tally so what you know how you know how many fives are there and you know a bunch it can outweigh a bunch of twos if you just add it up and take the average so um that's generally how we do it we've experimented with other things we've added the silver bullet as it's called meaning every partner you get a deal done with remarkably low friction as long as it's a small amount of money um in each fund as a patch um in various points we felt like something was a lot of balance um but the thing thing is these simple rules I think are really important in business anything about starting a startup or working a large company the way you set up the processes and architect the way communication occurs can dictate I think a lot of the emergent properties of the firm does it operate like a hive or does it operate like a bunch of swarming individuals can you tap into the wisdom of crowds or not can you um uh in a sense build a business that's greater than the sum of its parts and I think at Google gore and a bunch of other firms you found that they'll break up teams when they're more than five or seven people right and a development team if you have more than five or seven programmers working on something forget it boarded directors never more than seven people if we can help it there's there's a critical size driven efficiency to emergent properties of firms they think it's a really important decision making uh and how you orchestrate that or architect that can have more impact than how you manage this leader saying we're going to go north we're going to take that market more important could be you know I did what's your voting policy hence the hence the importance of your question thanks cool thank you I think that's it right you have been listening to the draper Fisher-Jurvis and entrepreneurial thought leader series brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technologies Entries Program you can find additional podcasts and videos of these lectures online at
