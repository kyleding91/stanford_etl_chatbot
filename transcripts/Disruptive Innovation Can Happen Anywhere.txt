 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. I was very lucky to be introduced to Hank a few years ago by a mutual friend. He's from Honolulu, but he is demonstrating that the entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in every corner of this planet. If you, as a tradition with us, we put people's bios online so we can minimize the introduction. So just go, if you haven't already, go take a look at what he's done with Sky Ventures and the number of different kinds of inventions that he's come up with but has turned them into companies. So without further ado, let's welcome a graduate of Johns Hopkins, a graduate of Harvard University, but he did his residency here at the Stanford Medical School. So let's welcome back from Honolulu, Hank Wu. Thank you. Hello, everyone. It's great to be here. Can you hear me okay in the back? Yes. Now, first of all, I want to know how many people are from Hawaii here in this room? How many people have been to Hawaii? How many would like to go to Hawaii? Okay. This room has good judgments. I know that. It's great to be here. I have very fond memories of my days at Stanford. The biggest memory in my head was when I was doing my surgical residency at Stanford Medical Center, I was a resident chief resident at Stanford. I was so poor that I bought a Cadillac for about $600. And it was a great car except for the fact that it didn't have a reverse gear. So I could only drive forward but not backwards. So it took a lot of extra time to look for parking stalls where I could drive forward at the end of my shift and the headlights didn't work. So when I'm driving on the freeway, I have to turn on the emergency blinker so I could seat the road every other second basically. So, but I have really fond memories of it. It's great to be back here. And I'm looking forward to telling a little bit about what we do at Sky Ventures. This is my office. Please come and visit anytime. Sky is a word that we invent. We create it. Sky is the Hawaiian word for water, ocean. Of course, sky is the blue sky. So where the ocean joins the sky is the horizon, which holds infinite breath and possibilities. Hence the name, Sky Ventures. And our business model is very simple. We look for the smartest people, the most ingenious ideas we can find, a global scale. And we transform them into businesses, their profitable, high growth. They can do something good for the world that we live in. And as you can see for our model, invent and disrupt and inspire. And the word disrupt is in there because we like to focus on the kind of business that are really game changers. Because it takes just as much time and energy and work to build something that's really a game changer and something that's incremental. Hence, we like to focus on disruptive. What is interesting, however, is we do all of this in a part world that is the most isolated land mass on earth. This is a Google Earth shot of Hawaii. So for those of who have been there before, anybody go to Hawaii not on an airplane. So we are in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. So we are about 2,400 miles from California and almost 4,000 miles from Japan. Highly isolated. But the point of today's sharing with you is the fact that entrepreneurship can take place anywhere by anyone in any subject matter. It matters not where you're located. Silicon Valley Stanford is a great, fantastic location. It is the mecca in the minds of many. But it's not a requisite. It is not a requisite for innovation. It is not a requisite for creating great enterprises. So I would like to invite all of you when we have a chance to come and visit us in Hawaii and come and visit us at the Sky Ventures. We would love to get to know you and share with you what we do. So just a plug for Hawaii while we are here. It has the highest percentage of million years in the United States. You will find every celebrity entrepreneur in Hawaii shopping at the same Whole Foods and Safewood. Oprah lives there, Dow lives there, Shrop lives there, Pierre Midiars there, Steve Cases there, everyone is there. We have the longest life expectancy in the United States. We have, in fact, Honolulu was one of the 10 healthiest cities in the entire world. Very ethnic diverse for those who prefer Hawaii, you know that. And we also have our own time zone. Hawaiian Standard Time. So when I was growing up, Hawaiian Standard Time used to mean that, it means you mean 30 minutes late basically. And this is also very interesting. The attractive lifestyle also makes us one of the largest importers of entrepreneurs in the entire world. I would say all San Lucidic and Valley, we probably have the highest concentration of entrepreneurs who are between successes and who are between failures of anywhere else in the world. And it's the perfect place to incubate, to start and to nurture the next really big idea. Otherwise, we're the most isolated land mass in the world, so no one is really going to steal your idea until it's been nurtured long far enough. And we take a lot of young people every summer. So last summer we have 15 interns and we have kids from everywhere, including Stanford, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, all around the United States and the world. In fact, I got a call in March of last year from the fellow who had did a summer internship with us the year before. He said, hey Dr. Wu, I'm going to quit Columbia and start my own company. I said, Chris, that's great, have you told your dad? And so he finished Columbia and he's now working in a company with us. So like many other companies here in San Lucidic and Valley, our basic guidelines are not so different, right? Go after big business, at least a billion dollars in market size, strong IP, good management team, and everything we do we hope at the end of the day will benefit the world and the community that we live in. We also pay a lot of attention to Asia and to China in all that we do as a very important market that we go after. Who's from China here? Okay, thank you. So we have a number of portfolio companies, six of which are really sort of very much in the midst of being grown and looking at the exits. I was sure with you briefly some of these companies and by the way, so Hawaiian style, Hawaiian time, right? Very casual. If you have a question, raise your hand. I'll be happy to entertain them at any time. So we really have sort of two categories of businesses. One is the area of novel materials. These are materials that I think are great platforms. They've been growing many different ways with multiple market applications. So the top three, true tags, CBA polymers and hygienics. True tag is an edible barcode. It's extraordinarily information rich, very inexpensive, that can be eaten and can tag everything that goes into your body, basically. So think about the implications of that. CBA polymers is a green tag for environmental radiation, which I'll tell you a little bit more about, and it had a very large row in Fukushima in the last couple years. And hygienics is working on the most advanced technology for an artificial cornea to treat blindness, to restore vision for the 10 million people in the world who are blind today. So think about these technologies. These could very well be prototypic companies right here in Silicon Valley, except we're doing this in Hawaii. We also have healthcare services platforms, including these three companies. Our Sky Vision Institute is focused on vision surgery. Everything you can imagine, refractive, cataract, acuplacid glaucoma, retinous surgery, as well as cornea transplantation. We have a DOSC B Institute that has a capacity of about 15,000 surgeries a year for the early detection of cancer. And we're also looking to build the largest cornea transplantation center in China today. And finally, we're putting the next vision of Sky Together, which will be a fund that's going to be dedicated to software and healthcare IT, which I'll tell you a little bit about. So TrueTags. TrueTags is an edible barcode. And as you find, the comment denominator for all these companies are threefold. One, a really big problem that needs to be solved. Two, a very unique solution and three, a great team. So why are we in this business? Well, counterfeit is a big business. In fact, it is considerably the largest business in the world, right? The margins are huge. In the United States, in the United States, it touches every product, every region, everywhere. So in essence, what we have created is another form of identification. Like a fingerprint, like a written scan, except in this case, we can do it in a very large volume and create massive amount of information on a customized basis. I think that gives you a sort of idea. We started with a silicon wafer, much like what we do here in Silicon Valley, for semiconductor manufacturing. And we can convert them into basically silicon. And the process, we can embed billions of combinations of spectral cold into the material. But the beauty is this, right? Silicon is already approved as an recipient in drugs. It's been used in many, many types of pharmaceuticals. Hence, there is no regulatory risk associated with the development of this particular product. And so, again, as you saw earlier, you give you a sense of scale, right? We're doing a salt, greener sugar, and greener trutags. So in this particular case, we can insert over a billion combinations of spectral cold. And we can read it. The simple reflection from a light source can be picked up and deciphered as the basis for tracking, hanging, anti-counterfeiting, and identification. So a light shine on the tablets can be read by an iPad enabled reader. In this case, we can tell you this is lipitor. 20 milligrams, a lot of co-expiration day, manufacturer sites, and so on and so forth. And this is a very powerful technology. Size of the market is quite large. There's one and a half trillion tablets made every year in the world today, of which one third are branded or high-value products. So that's a target for the counterfeiters. And so that basically makes up the $80 billion counterfeit drug market. But unlike a product shoes or Gucci bag, right? When you take a counterfeit medicine, it could have catastrophic consequences to the end user. So this is not just about economics, but it's also about something that's extremely important, right? For society at large. We can do these things for roughly one cent of pill or less. So that's roughly a $5 billion sort of opportunity for us, just in the pharmaceutical side equation. So for every two percent of the market that we're able to penetrate is worth about $100 million in revenue, basically. So it's a powerful technology, it's an interesting sector. But we're not limited, of course, to pharmaceuticals. You think about all the different things that we ingest or things that we don't ingest. Whether it's Chinese milk powder, whether it's computer chips, wine. The folks from Shaatullah Fee had come and talked to us and say, this is really interesting. Would it be possible to put this in a very high-end branded wine and spirits? We said, sure, of course, it's possible. However, could you send us six cases of Shaatullah Fee so we can do proper R&D on the equation? So every one of our portfolio companies has an executive team that seasons and understands the domain extremely well. So Ken Mansfield is a president. He was the COO of a company that he helped start it called Authentics. Started with five employees, just a startup company, grew to a point where it eventually was sold to the Karrang Group. Peter Wong is our chief open officer. It's been many years in Silicon Valley, a very transaction oriented attorney. It was involving an IPO of Leifrog and Quaker Sports. And so great management team that understand the security business, understands transactions. So that's true text. Any quick questions if I move on? Igenics. Igenics is another one of our material science companies. In this particular case, we're focusing on developing a solution to solve the problem of corneal blindness. This company came to be when I was on an airplane flying back to Hawaii from California and a Sandex to an off-emologist who kind of shared with me sort of the problem of the world not having enough donors for cornea or organs at large. And so it turns out it's a huge problem, particularly in Asia because of a number of cultural and religious reasons. Asians by large are very reluctant to donate organs. So on the left, what you see is a picture of a blind cornea on the rise, the same cornea after transplant. So it turns out that more corneas are transplanted in the world today than hearts, lung, liver, kidney, pancreas, combined. It is the number one human transplant procedure in the world. Ten million people in the world today could benefit from a cornea transplantation. The entire world's donor base is only about 100,000, which means 99% of the people who are blind in the world today will basically never have a chance to see for as long as they live. And that's the reason we embarked upon this project. So even with the 1% of population that could conceivably access a human donor cornea, there are many drawbacks. The rejection rate is roughly 20%. So one of every five cornea transplant rejects because there's no matching at takes place. There's no abial blood typing or matching. There's of course the risk of disease transmission with a human donated organ and they have to be on lifelong topical immunosuppressive medication. So there are clearly limitations. So we have developed material from Reconvenient Human Collegium that has this very unique property to allow epithelialization and nerve growth to take place within the organ. We have now seen a very long-term follow-up in group of patients that have been transplanted. And we have just finished the completion of a manufacturing facility that can supply basic entire North American market in Honolulu. And this material interesting enough can be laser sculpted to give it the right refractive power which makes it extraordinarily interesting and powerful because conceivably this technology could be used not only to treat the 10 million people with cornea blindness but to be used for refractive correction, things such as presbyopia as well which impacts basically everyone over the age of 55. So our vanages are multifold on a limited supply. They're no longer restricted by the 1% sort of lottery for someone who wants regain their vision. All of the shelf convenience. If you're a surgeon you want to schedule a case for three o'clock, Tuesday, next week you can go ahead and schedule that surgery. You don't have to wait for someone to pass away, will and donate their cornea for someone to be able to pick that up, process it, harvest it and transport it to a recipient. And the fact that allows nerve and epithelial growth is extremely important from a clinical standpoint and no lifelong need for immunosuppressives. We have an opportunity to capture really a $2 billion market opportunity but equally important we have a chance to do something that fundamentally is extremely important from a humanitarian standpoint for the 10 million people around the world who are blind and who basically would never really have a chance without the technology such as this. The post who was the COOA physics which was acquired by AMO for 1.3 billion and then was sold to Abbott, 1.2 is our vice chairman and Tony Lee from Silicon Valley who's done three venture-backed medical device companies all successfully exited is our chief operating officer. So again, the same thing, big markets, strong IP, great management team except is done all in Hawaii. We also have another healthcare services companies. I'll go through these very quickly. We run a surgery center that has a capacity of 15,000 surges here with 13 surges. This is really sort of a very synergistic play with our core eye business. When you come to Hawaii, please come over. If you need to have eye surgery, it will be on the house. Just give me a call. This is the lobby of our center and it's beautifully constructed. This is part of a franchise that we hope to expand throughout Asia and China as well. Of course, as I mentioned before, we do all types of eye surgery. We also have an endoscopy center where we do colonoscopy and endoscopy for the early detection of cancer. Similarly, if you ever want to have a colonoscopy, please give us a call. This is the last company I'll share with you before we go to Q&A. In the course of developing our artificial cornea, we have to assemble a team that's really world-class in material science. Then we saw an RFP from the US government asking someone to develop a material that could bind radio active particles. We had this group of really great scientists sitting around the room and say, hey, could we try this? Of course, that wasn't an area of our commercial expertise, but we certainly knew about materials and we knew about binding at a very deep level. We competed for that price. We won. We got a bunch of funding from the US government and then eventually developed a product. In an arena, that's the surface decontamination of radio active and hazardous chemical materials. It turns out that this is an industry that's not the most advanced with respect to innovation. The disposal of hazardous waste has never been really a sexy area of pursuit for technologists. The cost of waste disposal, as you can imagine, is really tied to both the volume and the weight of waste that you generate, basically. The economics are huge in this area. We have developed material that's got this exquisite ability to bind surface contaminants. Again, pictures are worth a thousand words. This is a regular asphalt surface that somebody's driving. You can see the oil and the grease and the grime on the surface. You apply this blue gel, you wait for it to dry, and when you remove it, I think you can appreciate that on the slide. You can see there in the back, I've really been power wash three times. Everything has been picked up and contained in that particular gel. This is a mold milled in a concrete sidewalk you can see before, during, and the after. This is a bilge tank petroleum before and after. So imagine the amount of labor and cost savings involved in the deployment of this particular technology. So let's say if you're going to clean a hundred thousand square feet of radiological waste, using traditional technology, which is really soap and water, radiagogized detergents, you'll probably generate around 140 thousand pounds of waste. And the cost of disposing that based on weight and volume will cost you about $350 million. Using this technology because the material at the end of the day is very compressible, it's very lightweight, you don't require to use water. We can do the same job for, in January, only about 13 thousand pounds of waste. So the cost of disposing for that is roughly only 33 million. So you're saving in this particular case, right, $317 million, by the deployment of this particular technology. So we have customers all around the world in all sectors of industry at this point. And then of course, as all of you know, Fukushima happened about two years ago, March 2011. And so, and this is going to be a very long, very costly, you know, cleanup. And in many ways, right, Japan is like a brother to us by virtue of the fact that we're in Hawaii. So we did a lot of work to volunteer our time and efforts to help with remediation and the cleanup in Japan. But again, you get the idea. This is one of our team members making a donation to the Japan Hyper Rescue Team, helping the cleanup. This is our chief scientist in Fukushima. And so this is an automobile that was driven in and out of Fukushima. If you're in Japan, if you see a car with a Fukushima license plate on it, don't go near it, right, because likely there's still residual radiation on it. And the radiation has been tracked. In this particular case where you apply the gel, you strip it off, you take away all the radiation, and you can do the same thing with tires and so on and so forth. So people are spraying entire automobiles and buildings and so on and so forth. So this is a kindergarten outside of Fukushima where the kids, since the event on March 11th for six months, they couldn't go outside to play at all because everything surrounding the building was radioactive. So we actually assisted Japan government and we did a complete decontamination of the entire schools, the kids go outside and play. And that was part of the basis for the CNN coverage of this particular event and technology. Thanks to one of the best publics in the world, Paula Page. And so as a commercial opportunity, 31 countries have nuclear power plants in this world. And they're through 439 nuclear reactors. Every 18 months, every one of these reactors needs to be maintained and shut down and restarted and clean basically. So very interesting sort of long term opportunity. Based on the technology, we've also launched a secondary brand called Prestor for environmental building restoration. This is a law enforcement officer's monument watching DC. You can see the before, the during and the after because the idea is we can actually remove debris and dirt from really fine surfaces without any damage or injury to that surface. This is the same Vincent's in New York, a very beautiful European style church and they have many years of carbon deposit on the walls. But certainly they don't want to power watch the inside of the church. You can see the before and the after on their run for tile on the limestone. In fact, this is an entire wall in front of where the candles are being burned. You can see the difference there basically. CBAP polymers. So our next thing is we're going to actually put another fun together. That's going to focus more on the software and the healthcare IT side equation as well. We realize there are lots of these accelerators that are spring up everywhere in the country. There are many of them in many parts of the world and there are several that are very well known here. Tech stars, white combinator and so on and so forth. So how many of you have entered in one of those competitions? How many of you plan to? If you enter one of these competitions, if you win, come and see us at Hawaii. We would love to work with you, back you, support you and help you. Because that's the business that we're in. It's working with really smart people with great ideas, developing technologies that can have a really fundamental impact in the world. And guess what? You can do it in a part of the world. There's very little traffic. It's got gray weather. You can body serve, boogie board. You can go out of Hawaii in time and you can live longer than anybody else. To help me with this venture involves a couple guys, Dennis Coman, who was introduced to me by Tom. Dennis was the founder of Symantec, a fourth largest software company in the world, Inventor Spellcheck. And Bill Malone, who just retired from Cisco as their CTO, he's from Hawaii. He grew up there. He just moved back there. So we're going to forge a fun to really look at young entrepreneurs in this area. So that's it. That's the lineup as Sky Ventures. So if you have a chance, I will really urge you to come to Hawaii, come and visit us. We'll be very happy to talk to you about any ideas and innovations you might have that we really have a fundamental disruptive impact on the world that we live in. And so I hope to see one or several of you in our photo lineup for next year. Thank you very much. And I'm open for questions now, please. Raise your hand if you have a question. And now. Dr. Will, okay, I have two questions. One on the cornea transplant. Does insurance on the numbers of the potential market? Does insurance play a role on that? In that at all in those numbers? Like for example, let's say there's 10 million people that need the cornea transplant. Do you say X amount of those people would need insurance to cover the procedure? And I know some of the questions. I know some of the questions cover that procedure. Very good question. So our market number is the two billion. It's only their dressable market in the parts of the world where people have the ability to afford to pay for cornea, whether through self pay or through insurance. But as a corporate policy, we have also established a nonprofit charity with a specific purpose of donating cornea in those regions of the world where people would not have the ability to pay either through themselves or through insurance. How do you make sure your entrepreneurs don't just go surfing all the time? We can't. But they're, but they're self driven, right? It's, if they go surfing all the time and that's all they did, ultimately they're not going to be successful, right? So if they're not going to be successful, they're not going to last very long. So there's a process of self elimination. And it's interesting. So I'm a swimmer. So I swim almost daily in the ocean before the sharks come. And it's great. It's sort of like my problem-solving time in that water for 40 minutes. So Hawaii offers a really interesting environment. But I think people there work just as hard. They're just as driven and just as committed. Except you have a lifestyle that's sort of really unmatched basically. Because someone was going to slack off. They can do what in Palo Alto as well as Hawaii basically. What key personal characteristics do you find make the best leaders or the best successful people? That's a very good question. One is an enormous amount of optimism in general. And second is a very high level tolerance for pain. Because right, startups are difficult, right? You're made with challenges. Unlike walking into an established company where things are kind of layout, here you have to sort of figure out the map and find a car and find the gas and drive the car yourself. It's all about creating something for nothing. So you have to really love it to thrive at it. I have some more specific questions about trimitab and scaleability at the problem. I was wondering about your topics and that you were talking about scaleability. Is it already a scale where you have a number of orders for the planning and the actual type of stuff? What do you do by the way? I'm a great expert. Okay. I'm just curious. It's a very good question. So we have the capacity. It's a catch-22 basically. So we have a large portfolio of prospective clients globally basically. But we've also figured out enough of the nitty gritties of this technology we understand efficient scale. So when it comes to pharmaceuticals, no question. We can do massive volumes at when send a pill and make it a very predictable business from a cat-x and a profit standpoint. Sure, it depends. I don't have the answer to that. Dr. Duman, describing the moment where you kind of walked out of med school and made the decision to go more the innovation path as opposed to standard medical practice. What was it that caused one-director merstial? Well, my cat light caught on fire. So I actually didn't walk from medical school to business. I came to Stanford to do my training as a surgeon. So I got into Stanford. I was a resident. I was chief resident. But being a surgeon and being a Stanford, it was just a great place because everyone was entrepreneurial. And sort of the concept being creative and problem solving was all around you. So I was very much bitten by the bug. So the idea was really to look for problems to solve in the operating room because there were many. And eventually we got into the business of creating, inventing devices and solutions that could solve these problems. And we discovered sure enough there are people who would invest and paid large sums of reward for coming up with a great solution. And that's how that transmission eventually took place. And when a cat light caught on fire, it really crystallized everything else. So. Oh, yeah, it's going to fall off in the question of he asked. When you say high tolerance of pain, could you have an example or you've never specifically got a word with it? Like, I could be like context. Do you play sports? Yeah, what did you play? Soccer. Soccer. Soccer. And what was training like when you were playing soccer? We did days when you were poor. So hard that you just think, oh my gosh, I cannot go another five minutes. It's like more of a mental game than like a mental game. A mental game? Oh, absolutely. Oh, absolutely. It's very much a mental game. Sure. All right. It's it requires a certain amount of mental toughness, I think. All right. I mean, it's not for everyone. Not everyone's different. It's about casting life. If you're really tall and thin, you shouldn't be a wrestler. You should be a volleyball basketball player. Entrepreneurship is the same thing. Some people thrive in conditions where there's uncertainty and there's challenges and imperfection. Other people really hate that. So it really selects for different sort of people. No right or wrong, no good or bad. Everybody's different, basically. And so. All right. So I'm just thinking about the application of the products that you want to get into as many fields as possible. And it's just kind of spread out the word of the product. At the same time, you definitely going to run into some. A lot of problems with safety issues and some other issues. Only if I actually try and think about what you actually know if something can be worked somewhere. And yet, as entrepreneur, when things are all going well, it's perfect. But even as you have a great product, when it's actually having one or two very serious safety issues and some other areas, especially all of them are kind of in an industry. And then you know, how do you balance that? And how do you know that a risk is something that you want to actually take? It's a rare moment when things all go well as an entrepreneur. But it's no more dangerous than walking across the street on a Friday night in Palo Alto, either, basically. So it's just a constant sort of assessment of your risk and your return. And of course, you want to be thoughtful. You want to be strategic. You want to understand your risk so you can deal with it proactively, basically. But entrepreneurship is a risky game, basically. And that's just the nature of the beast, I think. I don't know the question. Sure. This is a product question, Dr. Wu, on the Polymer's product, when you clean the radiation off the car. The vehicle is there a method that you can tell with percentage that it's fully cleaned? Sure. The gyro counter, right? So with a gyro counter, you're going to be able to know how much radiation there is before, how much air is after, how much you capture. It's actually fairly, fairly standard easy. It's easy to do, basically. Yeah. Well, they actually five hands go at the same time. Do you feel like we might have the same exact question? What do you do with the waste once you're doing it? It depends very much on what it is that you're removing. So if it's radioactive material, they're very strict statue that you have to follow. So what we're doing is really you're capturing and transporting that to a safe place, basically. But if it's dirt off your backyard, the material is incinerable, super compressible, water soluble, biodegradable. So you can actually, you can't a littlely throw in the trash, basically. So to follow up with another product question on the true types, I think it said that there's like some crazy amount of combinations that you can make and it works based on reflection. So I was wondering if that, if the reflection has to do with some sort of different powering you do on the surface of that, so can dioxide, or whether you are molecular, or changing the process? It's actually now a porous, so we're actually crew now a porous structure within a silica, basically. All right. All right. Can you talk a bit about sky ventures and business model and its relationship to the entrepreneurs? I'm getting the sense that something in between, sort of like an incubator or a pure VC. Right. So it's not a pure VC in the sense that we don't just deploy capital, but we're quite hands on. So typically, we will work with an entrepreneur in a very early stage, but we will actually really sort of roll up our sleeves because we're operators. We understand the pains of what it is to do with startup company. So we'll now deploy capital, but human resources and time and energy. So it is a hybrid. It is very much a hybrid between traditional venture capital and technology accelerator. Yeah. Good question. How did you, you mentioned with the Cornia product, you've got the arm that does that for those who can't afford it, you know, kind of a corporate social responsibility thing. How do you, how do you, how do you determine how much to put into that versus, you know, the being of venture capital firm? How do you draw those, how do you draw those lines that you make in that call? Is that, you know, any thoughts on that balance between the social responsibility in that sense and the product making aspects? Sure. That's a really good question. I mean, that's probably a fairly long discussion that, you know, we can share after the session also. But Sky Venture is really, you know, as the parent company, we, we allow our portfolio companies to make their own decisions, you know, about business models, but it has to right make sense because the business has to be successful, right? You can't, in order for the philanthropy to be successful, right? So, so the car and the horse has to be in the right order, basically. And there's a happy medium somewhere where you can truly do something good for the world, because also build an enterprise that's, they know that's kind of, that's kind of great brand, that's profitable, and it's got a lot of growth ahead of it. So, like anything else, right? It's judgment, right? It's judgment. So, also about the formula and the plan, like how did you expand the work that you're trying on and kind of adapt to the healthcare system? So, how did I work? Like, expanding like the market in China and the Asia. Are you from China? Yes. Yeah, which part of China are you from? I'm from China, I'm from China. Where? Shandong province. Okay, I was just there. Tindal, Tindal. Yeah? I'm from the South Care Systems, very different. Yeah. It's, it's very different, but it's changing, right? And it's evolving. I was in Shandong just last year. I went to, um, Tindal, and they have the largest cornea transplantation hospital in all of China. And, um, but their volume is not very large because there's a lack of donors, basically. Uh, so I think China is a, it's a powerful economy. It's developing very quickly and things are evolving. Um, and I think, um, but it's a very different system. So our basic approach in China is to work with very strong, uh, Chinese partners, right? Uh, that can understand best ways to sort of enter that market and work that market. We provide is a very fundamental technology, all right? The source of supply that's, that is extremely rare and valuable. Uh, but we can, we cannot go and learn the system in every country from scratch, right? So for China, for Japan, for Korea, for Europe, for that matter, right? We're all working with local partners, basically. So that's, that's our fundamental approach. Um, okay, good work. Okay, good work. I have a question about, uh, what kind of, um, um, technology-based products that you're actually willing to try and see? Like, how long do you, for example, you know, if something that's going to really change the entire, uh, entire field, what it's going to take maybe 15 years to try it out, are you actually willing, uh, to, to, you know, get into the field? Or are you more interested in something, getting involved with something that is going to have quick results, but not as a result? The kind that the surf is up or not, right? Well, something that's going to take 15 years is best at a university. Well, that's the function of a university of an academic research institution, right? It's basic fundamental knowledge, basically, right? We, we were, we were love to be in a position where any of you have an idea, right? That we can prove if there's validity or concept in a commercial marketplace, because your tests you can do, right? We're not in the business of creating fundamental technology from scratch, because that's unpredictable. It could take your year, it could take you 100 years, and, and we don't have 100 years, right? So really it's about testing, evaluating commercially viable ideas, but not fundamental research, right? Fundamental research is for the university, basically. Back. Can you give a couple examples of how Skye has helped the companies you've covered up there, beyond pure funding? Sorry, I couldn't hear your second part of your question. How Skye has helped a couple of the example companies, beyond pure finances? Sure, sure. In, in number of these instances, we're sort of the founder, if you will, you know, of the business, right? So, in the case of TrueTax, for example, right? It was a very smart scientist who had a great innovation, right? But there was no management team, there was no initial proof of concept, there was no development of the reader technology, there was no manufacturing. So, so, we as Skye actually played a role as part of that, as part of that founding team, if you will, right? We set up, you know, these different components so we can prove a concept, demonstrate there's commercial value, and then ramp from there, right? So, yeah, the fact, I mean, we are a founder in many of these businesses, if you will, much more in just the financial investor. How do you normally find the technology for these businesses? So, you say that you're in the business of really accelerating commercially viable technology, but what kind of strategies do you use to find where these technologies being developed, so that you can create more. It's like anything else in life, right? It's a certain deputy place apart in that, and it's also about sort of the, you know, the network. So, for me, we have a lot of network through my alma mater, right? Hopkins, Stanford, Harvard, and the likes. We do a lot of work with, you know, different universities, you know, we fund just some types of research. We have 15 interns that come through our shop every year, and everyone in the ring, like really unique, interesting ideas. But we're in the business of people more than anything else, right? It's about connecting with really smart people who, with a dream. With a dream and a vision to do something different. But no one person can do that alone, right? It takes a lot of efforts, and it takes a lot of sort of an appetite for risk to make that happen. So, we're in the business of people, really. And so, I'm really glad to be here today, because I suspect one of you, or many of you, have such an idea, or have such a sort of a dream in your mind, basically. And you are exactly the folks we want to be talking to, basically. Very hands-on question. What do you interns do? On the first day of their internship, we require everybody to learn how to do CPR, and use an automatic defibrillator. So, they can save somebody's lives during the course of their internship. And we sign them to different tasks, depending on their level of interest, right? Because so, there's enough sort of technical projects, and they're very sort of science and technology oriented, and we can actually go into a lab and, you know, work on something. Some other folks are more interested in business, right? We would put somebody on a supply chain analysis, you know, figure out the CAPEX, you know, the risk factors, and all that stuff, of course. But we require every intern to make a presentation at the end of the internship on an idea that they would like to pursue, right? Kind of a full-blown business plan, right? Thing through this. What would it take? What is this worthwhile? How do you make it a big business? How do you plan to do it? And because we want everyone to have some presentation skills, so they can go out there and pitch an idea when they're done with this internship. So, it's fairly flexible, actually. So, you see if your therapist is a man in perfect order, and all these managers are involved in. How do you distribute your time? I always swim in the ocean daily. You saw my office earlier. And I try to distribute my time again around people, but not events or projects, right? So, every one of our companies has a leader, you know, has a chief often officer or CEO who's job in life is to live and die by that company. So, they are it, right? The book stops with them, basically. And my job is to find those kind of people, right? We really have not only the expertise, but the passion to make that business successful. So, again, I spend most of my time on people and ideas. I would say it will be virtually all aspects of healthcare that requires innovation. But I think the area of healthcare IT in particular is a very large area. For whole variety of reasons that you're aware of. And that's very much an area that we are particularly interested in diving in, you know, much deeper. In fact, there's an entrepreneur here I met earlier who's got a great idea. I won't say the name, but we met just about an hour ago. There are so many. Instead of giving you sort of one, I think maybe I can summarize for you. At the end of the day, there are a lot of factors that have to work in concerts for one of these ventures to be, you know, ultimately successful. And timing is one of them. Because you operate in an environment where there are lots of other smart people in the world with equally great ideas. You operate in an environment where there are lots of funding and resources in this world chasing after great ideas. So, I guess the big challenge is, you know, you have to know where you are relative to everything else. I tell people it's like sailing. You've got to have a great ship, which is your technology. You've got to have a great crew, so they know how to sail, but you also got to have wind basically. And you can't do it without, if one of the three variables are missing basically. So, we've made all kinds of mistakes, of course, right? Picking the wrong guy for the management. You know, there are people who have perfect resume, but when they show up, when they have to make their own Xerox machine or get their own coffee in the morning, they're shell shot. Oh my gosh, I've never done this before. What am I going to do? You don't know that, till they really show up. You have technology that looks fantastic and a week later, right? Someone equally smart comes up with something that completely obvious, you know, that particular technology. So, these are all things that happen. But as they say here, right in the valley, right? You want to feel early, so you can go on. And nothing wrong with failure. The worst thing is never taking a chance in the first place. So, what are the aspects you look for and the people you surround yourself with? It's very simple. I want them to be smarter and better looking than I am. Because then I don't have anything to worry about, right? Then they can take care of as many tasks, as many difficulties as possible. Always, you know, always, you know, higher up, recruit up, basically. One more. So, the cloud and service providers like Amazon Web Services and Rackspace have made the fixed cost of starting an IT company essentially zero at the beginning. What's going to be the next big thing in the medical space that similarly lowers the barrier to entry? There are many. I can talk to you afterwards, actually. But that's extremely valuable, right? So, now it's an even playing ground, right? So, what you need is people, we really smart ideas, right? That means someone with a great inventor, with a great concept, and a critical insight can be as competitive as some, as the next guy who's got a big infrastructure behind them, because you don't have to build as stuff from scratch, basically. So, the playing field is really even. That's why being creative and smart having great insight is going to make a huge difference. And that's why healthcare IT is going to be a hot area, I think. Thank you. Yeah, how did you start? So, it was actually that, you were playing rides. I was flying back and... I think initial capital had to come from somewhere. How did you, okay, we're going to... This is our first project, our first company that we're going to start with. How did that all start? It's like the old fashioned way. And when the home sat down, took my checkbook and started the company, basically. All right, thank you. Thank you.
