 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. But let's start with the point that Jensen made the tremendous impact that TSMC has had. Not only the creation of the fabulous semiconductor industry that I think couldn't exist without that leadership, but also the tremendous impact it had on the Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing. And really being the spearhead for the growth of that industry. Did you anticipate those kinds of changes when you began the company? Did you think you could have that kind of impact around the world? No, not at all. John, actually the very idea, the new business model, the pure play, fondry business model. Now everybody thinks that it was a pretty good idea. But at the time it was really a solution that was looking for a problem. Because as Jensen said, it was meant to be a platform. The problem was that at the time nobody needed that platform. There were very few fabulous companies in existence at that time. There were maybe 20 some fabulous companies. Now even those fabulous companies did not think that they needed a TSMC. But they felt that they would rather go to Toshiba, ASE, Hitachi, Fujitsu, or even Intel, or TI for FAP service, fondry service. Now of course, I mean those big guys, the Japanese companies, Intel's and TI's really didn't want them, you know. And they would make stuff, make wafers for the little fabulous companies only at a very steep price, not a financial steeper price, but the price of wanting their designs for their own sales, for their own products sales. But still we were not trusted enough, our technology was not trusted enough that they would come to us. And the big companies obviously didn't need us. Now. So it was the solution waiting for a problem to happen. Now the problem happened pretty quickly in the early 90s. And I think that our existence certainly helped to accelerate the formation of a lot of fabulous companies. There were maybe 25 fabulous companies in the whole world in 1985, 1986. And then 10 years later there were 400, 500 fabulous companies. And some of the big ones were started in that period, in that 10 year period. I mean, having worked in a fabulous company, involved in starting two of them, one before TSMC that had to do exactly as you said, go one partnerships with the big players who this was not their primary business. And then forming one of Theros with TSMC. It's a night and day, completely different kind of experience. Yeah. Right. Right. I don't know. So talk about the impact on Taiwan as well. I mean, the catapulting of Taiwan into the semiconductor manufacturing business in a big way. I think in many ways we were the first in Taiwan. We were not the first semiconductor company in Taiwan. Taiwan had other semiconductor companies before TSMC started. But we certainly became the most successful semiconductor company in Taiwan after a few years, after only a few years. And also, I think that we really set a model. I hope for Taiwan in hope with governance, in innovations. Almost almost 95, 99% of Taiwan companies operate with health and gross margin, you know, gross margin, 4 or 5%. And they don't have money for on-de, they don't even have money for sales marketing for heaven's sake. With 4 or 5% gross margin. And we, I believe, with the first company that showed them to be a world class company, to be a real successful company, you need to have on-de, you need to have the sales marketing. And because you need to have on-de, your gross margin would have to be in the 40 or 50% range. So, I think we set the first example. And on corporate governance, I believe that we set an example also. So I think TSMC did begin to acquire a different meaning in Taiwan as a corporation. So tell me, I think Jensen alluded to this focus, and you said it to pure play. This focus on manufacturing excellence, R&D and manufacturing designed to bring new semiconductor lines to production faster. How did you get decide to focus on that? How did that become the central focus point for TSMC? Well, because one reason, in fact, maybe the principal reason was that at the time I started a TSMC, I had already worked in the industry, semiconductor industry, for 30 years. I joined the industry in 1955 and started the TSMC in 1985. And I had already been the head of the largest semiconductor operation business in the world, Texas Instruments. Yeah. So there was a soon-dynasties Chinese point that said that to be the leader, the first thing you have to do is to climb to the top of a high building and look down on all the available roads in the world. And I did that actually at TI. I occupied perhaps the height of the industry here and looked at the all the available roads. And there wasn't really any for a newcomer to compete in all of them. So I had to figure out a new road. And the new road was this new business model. But then, of course, the problem was that it was a solution looking for a problem. But happily, the problem could. You know, I think Jinson was one of the problems. Yeah, that's right. You could promise it a career. But I think you undersell this point, Mars, because there were some earlier attempts at Silicon Foundry's, but they had mixed business models. They were CAD tools combined with companies that had manufacturing lines. And they never put the focus on manufacturing, ECLINCE. I think Jinson, hit on trust. Your customers for the trust, the SMC, you better be manufacturing. Yeah. Yeah, that's certainly. I mean, I owe a lot to a lot of people. I owe a lot to my own family, my own early upbringing, which did instill in me values of integrity and being trustworthy and so on. I owe a lot to the education I received, Stanford. And Stanford, although I spent only two and a half years, I must mention Harvard and MIT as well. Exactly. But the two and a half years I spent in Stanford getting my PhD, I think were very important years, decisive years for me. Because I had started to work already in the semiconductor community. Before I came to Stanford for my PhD. And I have to say now that before I started working, my studying at MIT was really not serious. I really didn't know what I wanted in life. But then I started working. And I knew what I wanted now when I came to Stanford. I had been at TI, I had been in industry for six years already. And I had been at TI for three years. And I was on the rise at TI. And they sent me to Stanford to get my PhD. I already knew what I wanted. And I was a very, very diligent and serious and hardworking student. That was the only time I was a hardworking diligent, serious student. So I'm sure the students would like to know the secret of finishing a PhD in two and a half years. I was a very diligent and hardworking student. So tell me how the pieces of your education fit together. As you said, you were at Harvard first and then you switched to MIT. And then went to work before you came here. What happened there? Why did you switch from Harvard to MIT? Harvard's not such a bad place to get a degree from. Not at all. In fact, even now, I consider that to be my most exciting year. It was I was freshman. I just spent the freshman year. But remember, the time was 1949 to 1950. And there were very, very few Chinese. There was no Chinese American politician. There was no Chinese American even businessman. There were Chinese American laundry people. There were Chinese American restaurant people. Now the only really serious profession, I would say middle class profession, that a Chinese American could pursue in the early 50s would be technical research or development engineering in there. So although Harvard was a very exciting year, but the Harvard didn't even have engineering as a specialty. The undergraduates were general education. I didn't think I could find a good job anyway if I got a bachelor's degree at Harvard. So I... We probably would have still let you in more. So I switched to MIT the second year. I switched to mechanical engineering. And then as I said, I really wasn't all that interested in mechanical engineering or engineering at all. I was a lot more interested in politics, business, economics, general things. So that's why Harvard was far more interesting to me, the MIT turned out to be. But I actually went on, of course, anyway. And in fact, I wanted to get a PhD at MIT. However, I failed the PhD qualifying exam. And they allow you to take it twice, you know? I think it's the same rule as Stanford there. They allow you to take it twice and I failed both times. So what was I to do? And I decided that I would just go to work. And I was kind of sick and tired of mechanical engineering anyway. So I went to work for a new semiconductor company, Sylvania. And then after three years as Sylvania, the new semiconductor division of Sylvania, after three years, and I remembered one classic address that the general manager of that division gave to all his indirect employees. And there were maybe 150 of us who were gathered in the cafeteria. And he said, he made one classics comment that I remembered to this day. He said, our trouble, our trouble at Sylvania is that we cannot make what we can sell. And we cannot sell what we can make. Now ever since then, I've tried to stay away from that. At TI later. And of course, at TSMC. And I should say, I've successfully stayed away. That's why TI and TSMC around Sylvania isn't so good. So tell me about the time when you first returned to Taiwan, you had a... I was went to Taiwan. Taiwan was a strange place to me, a new place, a strange place when I first went there in 1985. So that was the first time you had actually been there? Well, I had visited it a few times. So you returned to head E-TRE, to head this industrial government hand. Tell me about that time and how that influenced your view of the semiconductor industry and what could happen in Taiwan. I mean E-TRE? It's E-TRE. E-TRE had had a semiconductor pilot line, actually semiconductor development project. For ten years, ever since 1975. In 1975, the premier of Taiwan, the prime minister of Taiwan, had the foresight to start a semiconductor development project in Taiwan, in E-TRE, in this industrial technology research institute in Taiwan. And if God is technology, well, is sent out invitation for bits for people, American companies to transfer technology, semiconductor technology to E-TRE. And there were several bidders, and the winning bidder was the RCA. So E-TRE got its early technology, CMOS technology from RCA. And then from that point on, they started to follow, to continue to develop that technology. The problem was that it was only a development project. So the RCA technology was about one generation old, anyway, one generation behind when it was transferred to E-TRE. And then when I arrived in 1985, which was ten years after they started, they had become two generations behind. Despite of their very hard work, they just couldn't keep up with the technology progress that most other semiconductor companies in the US at the time did. So we started with that technology, with the E-TRE technology, which was two generations behind the current technology. But we managed to start to catch up. And I would say that it took us perhaps ten years, the first ten years of TSMC. And now, of course, we started to have enough business volume to support a much higher level of R&D than E-TRE could. So how did you, the thought of starting a semiconductor manufacturing company and the capital that requires seems quite daunting? How did you get the company launched? Well, the government first promised to be a 50%, the largest investor, 50%, up to 50%. And so it was my job to get the other 50%. Of course, it turned out that even though the premier promised that the government would invest 50% in TSMC, I still had to get the bureaucracies agreement, which took actually, not just a few months, but also a lot of hard age. Patients of the same. But of course, the harder part, of course, was to get the other 50%. And the premier told me that I needed to get a technology, a multinational technology company to be an anchor investor. And then if I get this multinational technology company to be the anchor investor, then it would be easier. He would help me to get the rest from Taiwan business community. So I spend about eight months to get the Phillips. Well, actually I have written letters to a lot of people, Intel, TI, Toshiba, Hitachi, ANEC, Sony. And actually, three companies gave me presentation opportunities, Intel did. I wrote to Gordon Moore and Gordon Robach said that I have asked Craig Barrett, who said that time his CTO, I think, to see me. So I talked to Craig twice, two separate locations. But at the end of the second location, he said, no, when I interested. And TI the same way. Saw him twice, saw TI twice. I went to Dallas twice. And the same way at the end of the second meeting, he said, no, Mark Shepherd said, no. Too bad for him. And then, but the only company that appeared to be interested, genuinely interested, was Phillips. Interesting. Yeah. And I had wanted somebody better in technology and Phillips. In terms of semiconductor technology, I had described them as being in the first role of second-rateers. But I had a settle for them. Interesting. So I got them. I got them. And they invested 28%. So I had 48%. It turned out to be 48% from the government, Taiwan government, 28% from Phillips. And then the remaining 23, 24% I guess, I got from about 12 or 13 companies. And that was very interesting too. What generally happened was that one of the ministers in the government would call a businessman in Taiwan and told him that he would send me to give a presentation to that businessman to get him to invest. So I was on that kind of trips. You know, a dozen times. And there was one pretty big investor, a 5% investor, that actually bought when the minister of economic affairs in Taiwan first called him and told him that he wanted to send me. So I went there actually three times, three separate times. And I mean, he and his staff sat down with me for dinner. And none of those people knew anything about semiconductor. But they would keep quizzing me at dinner. And I didn't even, I wasn't even able to, I didn't even have time to eat anything. But it was twice. This happened two times, dinner, two times, dinner and interrogation for two times. And then he called the minister of economic affairs, the big businessman called the minister back there. No, no, no, I'm not going to invest. Well, the minister of course was unhappy, but he told the premier that. The premier said, let me call this guy. And so the premier told me later that he called this guy. And the premier also told me, he said, I told him that the government has been very good to you in the last 20 years. You better do something. You better do something while they're going enough. Well, that works. That works. That works. That works. That works. That works. That works. So you look at this, you look at what's happened historically. It's really fascinating because in the late 70s and early 80s, I think there was this thought that Japan would take over the entire semiconductor industry. And in fact, that hasn't what's, that has not been what's happened. In fact, there was the rise of TSMC and Taiwan, semiconductor industry, then now mainland China, Korea, obviously. How did this, how do you see what really caused this kind of evolution and these changes? Well, I really think that the problem with the Japan, with the Japanese industry was that they never created a fapless industry. It was the fapless industry in the United States that came up with all the innovations, almost all the innovations in the last 20 years. So I mean, there was this industry, Japanese semiconductor industry conference, old five, six years ago. And I was invited to attend, but I was not invited to participate in a panel that they had. So the panel, the panelists were all the Japanese industrialists, semiconductor industrialists, sitting up there discussing that they wanted the government to fund a common façue for them now. Like TSMC, what they said, you know, up on the stage. And I was sitting down stage, I was really getting very impatient. And then finally, finally, they stopped talking and the chairman of the panel asked if anybody in the audience wanted to make any comment. So I raised my hand. And they all knew me anyway. I said, I don't think your problem was not having a common façue. Your problem was that you just never had a fapless company. It was the fapless companies, you know, that the big difference that has occurred in the last, at that time, it was, I think, something like 2005. In 1985, 2005, the 20-year-time period, the Japanese market share had dropped 20 percent, 20 points. And the American market share had gone up 20 points. And the faveress in the meantime, or America, went from zero to 20 percent. Right. And that was a difference. Yeah. Well, not only didn't they do that, but they also didn't go into the hardcore Foundry Business, the Pure Play Foundry Business, which they could have done. They had the technology early on. They were good at the manufacturing side, but they decided not to do it, I guess. Yeah, but well, I wouldn't have welcomed them to that. I know you would. They were afraid of you more, I suppose. I would have welcomed them to create a faveress industry that we could then serve. So one thing I know that you also have a great love and appreciation of the arts and the humanities you mentioned, you're at Harvard. Tell me how that's affected you, your leadership, your style with which you've led TSMC. Oh, it certainly has made my life a lot more interesting. I am interested in both English and Chinese literature, and I'm interested in classical music. So whatever leisure time I have, I would read Chinese literature, English literature. In fact, the two books that I have were near to my bed, I read them usually in the hour or two. It was too tight to read anything serious. I mean, the two books, one is Chinese, it's the red chamber stream, Chinese classic. The other is Shakespeare's plays, and I'm particularly interested in Shakespeare's tragedies. I mean, there's a lot of meaning, I think, a lot of life's lessons in Shakespeare's play. When I'm interested in music, I'm interested in history, in journal, in biography, and all those, I think, add a way to my life's interest, I think. And I think that my business experience, I think, benefits from some of these lessons that I learned in the outside reading too. I often compare, I mean, students of the Second World War, the main battles and so on. I often compare the competitive battles that TSMC goes through with the competitors, and I think that's the reason why I think that I'm interested in the second world war. The first battle in the Second World War, the Stalingrad, the first battle in the Second World War. The first battle in the Second World War, the first battle in the Second World War. Well, actually, the midway, the naval battle. You know, the Japanese commander couldn't make up his mind whether to keep the bombers on deck or the fighters on deck. And he changed it. He changed it. Well, you know that too. He changed it. And that cost him the battle. Indecision is a very bad thing in the war. That's the idea. So, the final question before we open up the floor. What advice would you give to the students who are here who seek to have some impact, have a life that really achieves great things? And many of them, most of them will be in some engineering discipline. What advice would you give them? Learn and think. Both are important. Both are important. Well, here I go to a confusion statement. Learning and thinking are both important. If you just learn and don't think, then you quickly become lost. If you just think and don't learn, then you quickly run out of material to think. So. Okay, let's open up the floor for, we have 15 minutes or so for questions. And we have mics or what do we have here, Jim? Okay. The conditions you describe at the founding of TSMC are very similar to the conditions that exist today in the MEMS industry. I'm sorry, I have a little trouble hearing you. Could you be a little loud, perhaps? Hello. There it is. Okay. So I was saying the conditions that existed at the start of TSMC are very similar to the conditions that exist currently in the MEMS industry. And I know that in MEMS, MEMS. So I know TSMC is doing business in MEMS now. It's a very small part of your revenue. But I was curious what your vision is for MEMS for TSMC. And particularly whether you think TSMC can standardize MEMS the way it did for CMOS technology. Can TSMC standardize MEMS based technology, I guess, right? That's really the thing. Standardize? Yeah, create a standard based technology on which you're doing. That's what we hope to do. In fact, that's true. Mark is one of our close CEOs. Yeah. And I really think that MEMS is a very major part of what we call general, the next big thing. The current big thing is all these smartphones and tablets, the mobile products. What is the next big thing? Well, the next big thing, I don't know exactly where it is, I guess it's probably the Internet of Things, the wearables and those things. But whatever, I think it's very probably the Internet of Things and the wearables. Anyway, MEMS will play a big part in this. So we really have high hopes for MEMS, TSMG, as I hope to mention. Well, and you, Mark, you did achieve this in the mobile industry. In the beginning, there weren't standards, particularly for the analog side of it. And you needed analog to go into the mobile business. And you did become a leader in creating a standardized platform that people could design on. And you did this because you were willing to collaborate with the early fabulous companies as they came along. And you know what that's all about? And that's what we're trying to do in MEMS. So when you spun out of itry, do you think that could have been done just as a start? Or was it really important to have a government foundation there? And it kind of spun out of that? And the second question then is, is that a useful model to think in terms of manufacturing generally around the world, or especially in the US, spinning out manufacturing capability out of our national labs? I really think that the Taiwan, the PSMC, Itre, Taiwan, the three were in combination. I think that was a pretty unique one. First of all, I didn't go to Taiwan to start TSMC at all. I went to Taiwan to be the president of Israel. And I thought I was going to retire in that job. And the person that recruited me to that job was not the same person that asked me to start TSMC. In fact, the two of them were not friendly to each other. And the person that eventually asked me to start TSMC was unhappy because the other guy had recruited me to the Itre job. And anyway, two weeks after I arrived in the Itre job, this other minister who was unhappy because he didn't recruit me, asked me to go to see him. And at that time, he said, you ought to start TSMC. And well, of course, he didn't really understand semiconductor industry very well. So when he said you ought to start a semiconductor company, he meant something like the conventional IDM. But I came up with a different TSMC business model. A different game plan. And he had confidence in me because he knew what I had done at TI. So he trusted me. So even though he didn't understand what he found to be also, he trusted me. Did you think it was a unique situation or a good model to be more generally a family? I think it was a pretty unique situation. But first, you have to start with the insight that the Taiwan government had back 10 years earlier in 1975, when they started this seed group, this development group in Italy. It was pretty big money for them at that time. Even just the RCA contract, the technology transfer contract, was $45 million, which was big money for the Taiwan government at that time. And then sustaining their own devominactivity, and that probably cost a few million dollars a year. It was pretty big money for the Taiwan government, but they did it. And then of course, when the time came when I started to set up TSMC and the second minister and the premier said they would support 50%. They didn't know that it was going to be 50% of 220 million. They thought it was a much smaller number than that. But they swallowed that also. So they were very happy now. Recently, some people claim that beyond 28 nanometers the cost per transistor is not going to scale. They say that 28 nanometers is the last technology note that is going to have basically a lowest cost. Could you comment on that or do you repeat that? The question is below 28 nanometers, will we get any cost improvements in the price of per transistor? Some people claim that's the end of the road in terms of price drops per transistor. Well, I think it does become more difficult, but I think it will still happen. Now, I think there's a controversy going on. But I would say that it will continue to happen. We will still get lower cost transistor, maybe not the decrease in cost. Maybe it would not be at the same rate as it happened before. Chairman, considering your love for literature, is there an autobiography in the works? Is there an autobiography in the works? Well, actually I wrote one in Chinese. And it was a bestseller in Taiwan. It appropriately so. It was the envy of a lot of professional writers in Taiwan. We sold almost 100,000 copies, which constitute a very good seller in Taiwan. In fact, I had to translate it into English by a couple of professional translators. But I didn't like the translation. Shakespeare wasn't available. So I didn't publish it. I didn't publish it in English version. Hi, thank you. I think you'll like this one. Any advice to a startup that specializes in buying and selling primarily secondary semiconductor manufacturing? How to start a relationship with the SMC? A lot of that specializes in buying and selling of used semiconductor companies. Yes, yes. And we just actually started a new office in Taiwan. I do think there's a market for that. And even today, we'll be interested in buying some used equipment. But whether I would advise a startup like that, I don't know. I have to think about that. But they say market for it. Yeah, definitely market. Other questions? Yes. So I have a question. Reading, if you read Macbeth just before you go to sleep, doesn't it give you nightmares? Thinking of the witches there? Yeah. I generally, even though I'm primarily interested in Shakespeare's tragedies, but for bad time reading. Romeo and Juliet's a lot. Well, that's a tragedy too. Well, perhaps the merchant of vendors. Yes, okay. There we go. I represent the fabulous industry. We started a company, a semiconductor company in Connecticut. The name of it was Transwitch. We used your Foundry. And it worked out beautifully. It's a wonderful business model to have fabulous in your capabilities. And as you point out, it's key to the industry itself. But I want to thank you and keep up your Foundry. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Also, before we finish, I also want to say that the Jensen actually referred to my being on honeymoon when I talked to my visit to him. The year, by the way, was not 1999. It was 2001 now. Now, but what I want to say is that ever since then, I think Sophie's support has been very, very important. And when Jensen refers to my last five years, my last five years being the CEO again of TSMC, actually, I didn't become CEO again at the age of 75, as you said. I became CEO again at the age of 78. But anyway, last 10 or 11 years, actually 13 years, I think Sophie's support was most significant. I am thinking about picking your right-the-right life partners and other members of the class. What was that? For you, Morris, I was a non-technical and non-business question. How did you kick your smoking habit? I know you used to smoke when you were in graduate school. Did I kick it? Yeah. Or you have ever kicked it? I haven't really haven't kicked it. My philosophy on smoking is this. I smoke a park, by the way. And I know that the park smoking, or I think it's better than cigarette smoking. In fact, I have read the statistics. It's not in the good column. Not in the good column. Well, that's what you say. But the statistics I saw say that a pipe smoke go actually lifts longer than a non smoke go. Really? Yeah. And the way I see it, the way I see it. Is this an internal for pipe smoke or is not sure? The way I see it is that while pipe smoking is injurious to your physical health, but maybe it helps your mood. And I think that a person's mood is very important to his health. I try a nice glass of red wine. All right. Let's get another question. So Dr. Chan, I have a question. Now, everybody knows these state integrated circuits, the circuit design complex is getting higher and higher. So the process is more complicated. But at the same time, the consumer electronic side are demanding faster time to market, being able to deliver a product in a shorter life cycle. So in your view, how do you or what would be the challenge facing forward in balance out these two different requirements that are coming in the... John, maybe you can... I think the question revolves around the complexity of circuit design and logic design now with these complex trips has become really significant. I mean, look at Jensen's products, for example. And yet there's demand to deliver products in ever shorter periods of time. How do you see those two really meshing together and being resolved? Well, I think that there is a tendency that the capitalist companies consolidate. I think there'd be fewer in five years or ten years. I think some of them will be acquired by others. So you think we'll see model... For example, Jensen will be acquiring people right here. Yeah, you'll be buying people. I mean, will a model emerge? I mean, if you look at how Intel does design, they have multiple teams working sort of in a leapfrog fashion one after the other because the design takes so long and perhaps we'll see more of that emerge over time. Yeah. I have a question about your decision of going back to Taiwan. You are a really very successful person in P.I. Back in 1985. And what do you see in Taiwan that makes you give you the courage to go back to Taiwan? Well, I felt that... Well, actually at P.I. I did not achieve what I wanted to achieve, which was the CEO job. At the end. He only headed the entire semiconductor unit. So now, by 1983, I was actually told very plainly that I would not be the CEO of P.I. So I left in that year. I went to General Instrument in New York to become there. COO was the expectation that I would become the CEO in perhaps three or four years. Now, after a year, however, in General Instrument, although I still could be CEO in another two or three years, but I decided I would not want to be the CEO of General Instrument. So I was now at a crossroads. I was in a company where I really didn't want to be the CEO. Now, at that time, Taiwan began to back in. So I decided that that would be a good... It was a risk, but I was about 54 years old. I felt I could still afford to take a risk. I had achieved a measure of financial independence with my TI and the General Instrument stock options or all that sort of things. There's nothing like what you would consider wealth today. But financial independence, to me, meant at that time that I didn't need a job. I could just live on the interest of my money I had, which was true. So, interestingly, it was actually higher than time, too. But still, I didn't have financial independence. So I decided to take a risk. And that road less taken is what turned you into an engineering hero. I think it's really remarkable. Thank you. One more really quick question. I hope it's a good one. I hope to. Second, from your point about the CEO, what are the top three things or five things you want to share? You feel it would be important for CEO, maybe in a corporate and a startup. How do you find things that you think are important for being a great CEO? Of course, it depends on what kind of company you are CEO of. You talk about a reasonably big company, let's say $10 billion in that kind of company. I think a CEO's main job is to bring the outside to the inside. The outside is customers, shareholders, society, the world. Bring the outside to the inside and maximize the inside performance to cope with the outside. I think that's the main job. I would like to finish up by telling Morris that those of you who have been outside the back of the street and gone to the right will have seen a wall that has plaques like this on a breach of the engineering heroes. This is a replica for Morris of the plaque hanging out there on the wall. I'd like to thank Morris and John and Jensen. This has been a thoroughly interesting conversation. I would like to thank the reception outside back for those of you here in the auditorium. Those of you watching over the internet will have to presume that you aren't going to be here. Those of you who are here, please continue with us outside in the reception area. Thank you all for coming. Thank you.
