 You were listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at edcorner.stanford.edu. Today we have a wonderful guest with us. I want to have a special welcome for Dominique Orr. Dominique is the president and CEO of Aruba Networks. Interestingly enough, he was the chairman of the board of Aruba before they asked him to take on the presidency. So we'll hear a little bit about that. He has 20 years of experience in the IT world, working at HP for many years, Alpha and Web Systems, Bay Networks and Hughes Aircraft. And if you look back to a few years before that, he got his undergraduate degree in physics and then a PhD in neuroscience from Caltech. So Dominique, welcome. Well, thank you. Thank you. It's a great pleasure and honor to speaking in front of such a youthful audience, which I have not done for a while. Great. Well, I bet they're going to challenge you. I want to let you know. We're going to talk. I'm going to interview Dominique for about 40 minutes and then open it up to questions. So feel free to think of your questions along the way because you'll certainly have time to ask them later. So I'm really curious. You had a very interesting and very successful career before becoming the CEO and president of Aruba. What made you want to jump from being the chairman to being the president? And maybe you could tell us a little bit about the company and why that was such an intriguing opportunity? Well, sure. I think jumping is pretty strong word. I think it took me almost three years to be dragged into the opportunity. The thing is, I was very excited that not very frequently, in fact, probably very few opportunities every decade, you have a chance to capitalize on a big major shift of market to create a company of leading technology and application at the IT infrastructure. In this case, in Aruba, the enterprise customers worldwide, large enterprise customers. That shift was really driven by a couple of factors. In Aruba's business, we're building large distributed, secure wireless network for enterprise use. So we're not in the building of singular and that kind of business, but we are in the business of enabling companies such as Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, SAP, and so on to allow them a very distributed, secure, currently, Wi-Fi, and in the future, any form of wireless environment to support multimedia for applications. So the major kind of turning point for the industry is with the mobilization of the work forces and the virtualization of the cooperation, the whole flat, well-frenominant. Now people are working anywhere within and outside of a corporation, large corporation, but the traditional IT and network security infrastructure, such as routers and switches provided by Cisco and FlyWars and VPN, I hope I'm not overburning you of this terminology. From companies like Juniper and Cisco and Checkpoint is assuming a fixed infrastructure, it assumes that people actually work within building and the good behaving users are inside a full wall of a building and the potential hackers and malicious users are outside and therefore we create this kind of IP network that is really port to port and we created this idea called a DMZ, the Mid-TriZone with firewalls protecting those ports. The issue is now people with wireless devices expecting to get on network anywhere. How do you really address at the same time mobility and security and a rubour happened to have an architecture that addressed this very well? That sits on top of the Cisco and Norteil and IoT and network and because of that I get personally very excited. I was also, to be honest, kind of getting bored of planning trees in a backyard and cooking for the kids and how long have you done, I have planned it over 200 trees since my every time and by the time they ask me to be done. So I think the combination of the two is a very good decision that I made to start it out as an Android investor, a board member, a chairman and then a CEO of a Ruben Network Sins April of 2006, I became a CEO. Well I'm fascinated with the fact that you spent 12 years at HP and HP was known to have of course the HP way and very, very strong culture. How has that affected your running of a company like Aruba that's a small company that's very quickly growing? Does that culture translate easily or not? So HP is a big phenomenon right and that is the OHP and the intermediate HP and the current HP. So I have to preface by the first of all I left HP in 1994 and also it's a little bit presumptuous for me to try to capture in a couple of minutes the sense of what is called HP way but if I were there to do so I would say fundamentally at least the HP way that I grew up in as a manager get the still down to one thing which is from a just pure business good judgment. The productivity of your employees can be maximized by giving each one of them dignity and freedom and trust and let them create passion based on that confidence and run for it. So that is a very, very noble goal and as you can imagine actually it needs more management technique than a much more controlled environment and at least at the time that I was there one of the criticism of this approach is that you do not careful then you run into kind of consensus management because then how you are feeling good and no decisions are being made and I think it was that that juncture they felt that they were losing the speed to execute and they need some changes and then the previous generation of management came in and took it the other way to be very, very dictatorial and so on and I heard recently it got back. So how do I translate that into a startup environment? I think in a startup environment it is very, very important even double important to give that dignity and respect for the employees because it is a self sorting population out there. People just wanted to roll guys they would probably stay in large cooperation when the fact that they could leave a safe job and come join the startup for salary cut for some upside they normally come with some passion and you do not let them cultivate that that is very, very difficult to make them feel happy and also because it is a small environment much more focused this whole danger of being running into a consensus management environment is less than actually in a small environment. So in all the companies I tried to, all the companies I managed I tried to apply to HP rain I think people appreciated. Great, interesting. It does seem to translate. Yes, yes. You can move it from a big company and do a small hybrid company. I absolutely. Because it is all boys down to is at the individual level the dignity and freedom that you give to the trust and when people feel trusted they go for it. Great. Now one of the interesting things about Aruba is that you have decided to come head to head with some very big giants in the industry such as Cisco. Now how does a small company have the sort of the confidence and the strategy to go against a big giant like that? So we do day to day from a product level point of view have two competitors own it and it is Cisco and Motorola. And we kind of find this kind of space in between it. When you operate in that kind of environment you cannot think of those giants as your competitor or as you are dead. You have the thing of them as an environment in which you excel. So every product that you build even planned to think about has to fit into the whole ecosystem environment that this big guy is having. You just look for what is really breaking that they cannot fix. I have done enough. Start now. I really, if you asked me to distill to the formula of success of the small company competing against big company it all boys down to one factor. And that is speed, speed of execution and speed of innovation. And let's not say large companies people are any less speedy but the benefit of the big company is that they have the inertia but the drawback is they have the inertia. So I remember when I first entered the industry there was a popular saying that the reason God could create heaven and earth in seven days because she and he or he did not have any install base. So the big company have this legacy of stuff that they have to sell and they have a certain expectation and what's right around the project and so on. They have to stay the course. You can always map out in three, four, five quarters where they will be. And the way that you react is that you say that I'm going to get there fast. I'm going to get there with a vision that they cannot afford to execute because by executing a new vision it's going to tank the current business. So yes we have probably in through that self sorting process the smaller company have probably a higher density of more, I won't say competent but the more motivated people who have excellence and yet end the drive to make things happen. But let's not for ourselves. You know Cisco motor world they have lots and lots of talents as well every bit. If you take individual by individual and look at the best engineers they probably have or even better engineers. So there's not a fallacy of some really brilliant gurus sitting on a mountain top and create this big thing. What we really relying on for all the startup is the ability to go speed, force me to head without the burden of that install base and you have to kind of just drill that. Right. I just sum up a Rubin network is a five and a half year old company. If I sum up every single dollar we put in R&D in five and a half years Cisco spend that within five days, right, less than five days. That's how dramatic the difference is. There's no way that you can outsmart this big guy you can just outspeed them. Very interesting. Now interesting. You've taken two companies public. Now Rubin just went public a few months ago. Does that change your risk profile? Does that change the way you do business? Of course before your public people aren't looking at it with the same sort of eyes. They are not paying attention quarter to quarter. Are you getting closer to a Cisco just by going over that sort of barrier from being a private to a public company? So I mean I've done this twice once in 1999 and once in the 2007 eight years apart. First of all I'd like to comment on a dramatic environment between when I took out the public and a Rubin. In 1999 the mood was such so vibrant, right? And then you always go for this IPO row show. You go into the Boston and Fidelity and New York is all this big bank line. And all the big black limo is triple-pock. You cannot even go down there. And when you go up there you can see the portfolio manager come in. He has not even read your SEC or the SEC filing and so on. All he or she wanted is to sit there to look for his money and want to get a big allocation. We can flip it and sell it next day. So this time around people actually retry everything. There's lots of parking space. You can just walk up there and if you want to stay behind a little bit they might even ask you for lunch. So they want to understand. They clearly have mocked up the SOCO S1 document. A lot of analysis about your core competence, how you can sustain them and your business and so on. So much more thoughtful investing, right? That is important to answer your pre-public versus post-public operations. Because of all this very thoughtful investor mentality, you really have to stick to what you tell them in your IPO Roach show. What is your vision? What is your business core competence and how do you drive that core competence into a business model of growth profit and that profit? And then it makes you just have to think much harder rather than just go. It's not just speed, it's thoughtful speed, right? And then this other, so the issue of whether pre-public and post-public, what are the trade-offs? The trade-off is very simple. When you are competing with large giants, respectable ones for that matter, as we are talking about, you credibility is very important because you are going in and trying to stop, you know, you're going to go in and you offer to be the secure wireless infrastructure for all of Microsoft's 60,000 employees, you know, 350 sites, 66 country. You better be able to look people in the eye and say, I'm going to be around and I'm going to respond to contingency, speedily and so on. And I say, private company, you tend to have to exert a lot more convincing power for people to believe that. And it's also easy for a competitor to spin out, you know, they might be procured, they might go out of business, they might be this and that. And so you have to spend a lot of energy. And then once you get, the IPO actually, in the case of Aruba, is not for the purpose of raising money because we, you know, at the time we IPO, we have probably like 20 plus million dollars in the bank, we were a cash flow neutral to positive. And so we don't need the money, but we went out and raised $100 million. In that process, you get a branding process, you know, branding of a corporate image. Now people kind of read about you in business week and in Bloomberg and so on. And suddenly you get that exposure to the CIO and CXOs and so on. So that when the technical team selected your technology, you don't get this blank stare from the high management, say Aruba Hu. Now the burden that we have to pay, like I mentioned earlier on, is that you have under a lot of more scrutiny. Another thing is, of course, in the small company, one of the things advantage you have to attract talents is true star options and orders nice at ease. But, you know, after being public, you are under the so-called generally accepted accounting principle, the gap accounting, and you are under a lot of constrain of issuing star options or else your company will never be gap profitable. So those are kind of the big things that's on top of the well-known sovereign oxley compliance and so on. Interesting. So essentially, the going public gives you a tremendous amount of validation and credibility and sort of puts it on a lot of people as radar. Yes. And to the extent that it's worth all the other stuff that come of it, because one of our objectives at the time that I took up the post is clearly establish ourselves as the alternative to Cisco in this space. And at that point in time, there is Motorola symbol and a whole bunch of other startups. So our objective is to bring away from all the pack and I'm glad to say that by the June quarter this year, we are absolutely from market share point of view. We have our distance Motorola and our distance all the other. So now our objective is to be equal to Cisco. Super. So let's move a little bit away from strategy because these folks are really interested in what it's like to be a leader of a company like us, a fast growth company. Now you are the CEO. Who do you turn to for advice and guidance when you end up with a really challenging situation? Do I need to worry about my install base? So first of all, I have a very strong board of directors and I actually pick within the board of directors two gentlemen who have been my boss before and people who said I was crazy but I say I like to walk into the board room to feel I'm being challenged and challenged critically and with very wise people. So I use my board a lot. I also use management. I want to say management consultant. I actually use more psychological consultant psychologists quite a bit in the last ten years of my management practice because ultimately when you're talking about running a company, it's all boys, it all boils down to people and it's all boils down to your executive team working as a team. There is no lack of talent in the Silicon Valley. The fundamental issue is when you put all A plus players in the same room today operate as a single team and that is where you really get into a lot of counseling and looking at each person's psychological profile and strength and deficiency and kind of convince them to take the counsel and work as a team. So I'm all the counseling and advice is really built around creating a very powerful effective team because the leader of a company like Ruben Network is fundamentally is there to soft crisis and take advantage of opportunities. Which means there's no fixed formula. There's nothing written down in book every day. You go to work, you listen to the radio and you listen. You check on a web and see whether there's a new thing that happened that might look innocent but might hurt you 90 days down the road or even in a year or something that you could give you quickly react to take advantage of. Because being a CEO, if you are a really enlightened one, you would not want to dig into the day-to-day operations of your staff because that's what you have your staff for. So I think I work with advisors, consultants and so on and in death framework. Have there been any really surprising things that they've made you aware of? What would be the most unusual thing? Because you're obviously a very introspective thoughtful person. You have a lot of experience in management roles. Was there anything that was particularly surprising? I would say that one surprising thing is that people really, when they are very powerful and they experience, it's amazing how hard it is to change. In terms of the reactions and behavior, that is one thing that I learned over time. The other thing has to do with my management style. If you want to go for speed and thoughtful speed, then you have to trade off between a lot of discussion and analysis versus going with the gut. In order to do that, what I have is a phrase that summarizes the methodology we call Bruto Intellectual Honesty. There are too many decisions to make that too little time. Not just use your gut, sometimes your gut's wrong, then you tank very precious time to retract. What you want is to get all the facts and opinions and wisdom and experience our on the table. Have a really honest debate about it. Given a limited period of time, and at the end of that period of time you say, okay, I have enough opinions and facts. Let's make a decision and go. In that process, you need people to be very thick-skinned. Because if you look into a lot of situation, people get bogged down into very emotional argument or political situation and so on. It's when they have projected out a theory, a certain way of doing things, a certain architecture and so on. And they put their passion, which is good, and the ego, which is dangerous. Then you see people locking head and they get themselves into a position that they cannot back off. And then they have to find all kinds of ways either to face lobby other people to support them and so on or say face and so on. That is incredibly time-wasting. And if you recall, this time is the only competitive resource that we have in our hand. We cannot allow that to happen. So what I encourage is people to be thick-skinned about it and put everything out and don't defend it with your ego. Let intellectual honesty dictate. And the brutal part is the tricky part. A lot of people apply to the other guys. What I really remember in my creative term is to apply to yourself. When you really put forward a very passionate argument and when you actually get convinced intellectually, there's a better way to do it. Be brutal to yourself and say, okay, yeah, you're right. I put my best foot forward and my next try, I go and do it your way. So in that process, I found out that it's a immense amount of counseling that was needed because fundamentally for people to be thick-skinned, they have to be very confident. Somehow people carry baggage in their lives and so on. Not every people is as comfortable with themself as you think they are. And so a lot of the work is really to get them to be comfortable with themself enough in front of their peers to achieve what I need to do, which is the brutal intellectual spirituality. So a lot of the trend I saw is around that area. That's probably tied to my emphasis on thoughtful speed. Now, I can imagine that running a company at this speed could be a 26-hour a day endeavor. So how do you manage work-life balance when you're trying to go so quickly and accomplish so much? So first of all, I want to have a disclaimer. I'm not the perfect example of this work-life balance thing. And second of all, I really believe that in a lot of the situation in Silicon Valley, the work-life balance is not the right concept to use. The reason is the term work-life balance implied is something called work. This isn't kind of life. But I'm here sitting talking to you and so on. Is it work? Is it life? I hope not bad. I feel this is work and life is too. My point is there are people who take, I'm sure they are across the world that take the number of hours per week that they have to work is really for the substantial benefit for them to support their hobbies and the maintenance and so on, as a human being as a family. So if you really look at that that way, there is a section of your data that is dedicated to creating take-home resources and then the other part of the data is to consume the resources, then you have the balance that. But in our world, all this buzzword, virtualization, meaning, globalization, the mobility and so on, so it's very hard for people who have passion about what they're doing to define what is life, what is work. I think they're going to be all messed up. I don't have the I don't have the privilege to observe somebody like Picasso how they work. I mean, I doubt very much as a ten o'clock son of a gun to go to work. Let's start painting. So six o'clock I have to hit the bump. So when people really inspire and have a passion for the work, they carry the work with them that the issue is the don't let technology drag you down in a sense that it's okay to come up with an idea why you're driving, why you're showering and so on, but don't let that blackberry distract you every five seconds so you cannot enjoy a conversation with your kids or your case with your significant other or whatever. So I would advocate the concept of a balance of I don't know what this thing called that you keep a balance of mind share and assertive control of time management. I think time management is getting more and more important. And if you look at all the brilliant people that succeed in the business will, that they have incredible faculty of mind power and ability to balance and control resources mean energy time and so on. In my case, I'm very passionate about things, but when I get passionate, I totally lose track of my sense of space times and so I absolutely lose track of that. So I knew my deficiency and so since 1994, a higher assistant who's almost only job, at least predominant job, is manage my time. She gets absolute authority in dispatching me to do anything. I surrender all my weak time to this lady and so she would arbitrate and I will tell her my priority. And then you have to learn on techniques on trying to how to fill up your time and that's this famous saying that if you have a fixed-size bottle and you have a bunch of rocks, a bunch of pebbles, a bunch of sand, and what's the way to fill that up? And they all random. How do you feel, maximally, the largest mass? And the smart guy will fill in the rocks first and use the pebbles to the cracks and then use the sand to fill in the space, right? Rather than you just throw everything in random. But we don't do, and if the space inside that bottle is the aggregate time we have each week, I doubt it very much that people wake up in the morning and look for the rocks and fill that up and then look for the pebbles and fill it up first, right? So in fact, once I found out this right way to do it, I set up a new time and then I'll go into my staff meeting, first of all, they'll remove the rocks and then they'll remove the pebbles. Pebbles, normally we don't have time for a cent, right? By the time you're done. And actually, unfortunately recently, my company is moving so fast now that they have to create this new carrier called BOTUS. So because the problem is getting bigger and bigger, we have opportunities getting bigger and bigger. So my point is for me, it is no longer a work-life balancing, it's really basically balancing your resources, your energy and your time across all the things that you need to do and you will find the only way that you do it works so hard and still feel you're enjoying it is you take the work as part of your life but of course don't preclude to your loved ones sense. Well, so you also have a lot of experience working in different parts of the world. Do you find that it's very different when you're working in Asia or working in India or working in the United States? Are there different business practices, cultures that you have to keep in mind when you're working in these different regions? So the record I did move around a bit, I started a software division for HB and Singapore, I ran marketing operations for Asia in Hong Kong and then I started a couple of laboratories in Japan and lived there and also I worked very closely with the French division in HB and Grunop and even various parts in the US when I run what's the president of North-Telve content networking, business unit, I have a lab in Ottawa and so I have a taste of the Canadian how it works, they think, the left-wing, the boss and so on. And then of course on the business side, a different way of doing business and so on. So I would say, you know, I don't want to project a very regimen the way of classifying this because this is a dangerous song because it's culture, geography and so on. But I would I would keep some generalization. I would say there's one pattern I see that is different domestic in the US, particularly in the Silicon Valley compared to rest of the world and then I would like to perhaps highlight some similarity. I think that is the most in our similarity than this difference. The one major thing that is I think is different in the Silicon Valley is because possibly because of this emphasis on speed, we tend to in business be a transaction oriented, you know, we look at project at a time, one transaction at a time and so on. If you look into Europe and look in Asia, people tend to have a longer time frame and they emphasis more on relationship. And relationship, not only stealing with the people part but even relationship between two entities, even one is a supply and one is a procurer. A relationship in that sense meaning a sequence of gifts and take in multiple transactions. So you don't push the guide or limit every transaction and declare that's a win. So I feel that that is generally more inclination in domestic market and operations to kind of look at one project, one transaction at a time. So that is kind of the major difference. The similarity, you know, I have only had the privilege to work in the scientific community when I was in in the research in academia and environment and then the high-tech industry. So I can only speak in that narrow field. I say people are crazy. They work incredibly hard and reasonably hard. And to the point sometimes it's called physical pain. Why? I always curious why. When I go to different places, they all do. It's not just the slick and go, you go to Sink, where you go to Kobe, you go to Shanghai, you go to different places. So I talk to engineers, I like to after the normal work out, you kind of just pick people's brain, have a beer and so on. And I find that if I generalize why people work so hard, and of course there are people who don't. And I'm talking about when I talk to people who work so crazy, crazily hard. I find that there are only three reasons, common reasons, between a French engineer and East Coast, US engineers and a slick engineer, Sicken Valley engineers and a Japanese engineer. It's first, people are fundamentally want to make an impact. They feel this thing that they spend all this energy on makes a difference. It makes a difference for the company. Most important, makes a difference in the out world. If you tell me that if I finish this thing, you can ship a billion units and they are sitting in living rooms and they actually feel like that's an impact. So this impact, making an impact thing is just very strong in at least a niche to that. Second is people will work that hard. Only if they feel it's fun. Fun meaning not that particular moment that you really, really have the fixed thing, I only giving you five hours. Fun meaning that this is a general environment that I enjoy, I enjoy the colleagues, I think they smart and they're not obnoxious and people above me below me, they are good people and so on. So they want to have fun. They want to have impact. They want to have fun. And finally, they want to be rewarded. And reward can come in two form. Of course, the first one is okay, financial reward. I want to work so hard company. I'm pure to stock and I want to get my mortgage paid on. But the other part, it is less emphasized but equally maybe even more so if they want to be recognized. They want to be heroes. In a very small sense, a pet in the back, an acknowledgement in a coffee talking, they want to feel proud in front of the peers. And it goes back to all this dignity and things. So in a nutshell, I feel that actually more similarity in those areas than difference in the area that I mentioned. Cool. Well, let me get asked you one more question and then open it up. And the question is when I often ask speakers and that is what do you wish you knew when you were sitting in their place? When you were a student and here you were a biology student and a physics student, what do you wish you had learned when you were in school or gotten exposed to that would have helped you as you're in your position now? First, I have to think about how I was like when I was a student. Okay, so I, I, for all the time I was in schools, you know, through all the degrees, I was only a, I was a science student. So I have no idea if you hire class MBA student and engineering students, how you think, right? As a science student, all the way up to the PhD level. I feel in the scientific academia environment, it is a strict meritocracy environment, but the unit from meritocracy is individual. We went out of the way to give credits for some research done and so on for the individual, you know, to the extent that you have a paper that the list of orders longer than the paper itself, it's a short paper. And I have to take the cabin and say now large and larger, larger, larger budget project like in high energy physics research project and so on, because the budget is so huge, you have to forge a collaboration between Slack and the Fermi Lab and so on. So you, you have the collaboration, but fundamentally culture is getting, giving people individual credit for for the creation, innovation of the thoughts and ideas and implementation and experiments and so on. I found that if you really got a degree in that kind of ramen, you move into a business world. I find it took me like four or five years to adjust is in the business world, individual merit doesn't count. You know, the fact a consumer decided that Coke Zero is way better than new Coke and it doesn't know that it's good as Pepsi one and so has nothing, they have no idea who invented it, is it a group, is it a team or is it and so on, right? So, so in the business world or it matters, is whether the project is successful and success was defined by where the customers are buying it and loving it and continuous come back and buying it, right? So I think it took me a long time to adjust to it because once you sink into the team winning and the cross functional is not just engineering created a, you know, really good product and marketing scrub and therefore we didn't, you know, that's besides the point. The whole idea is the are we winning market share is the customer buying and engineering, right? So, so this whole teamwork concept way, way beyond the individual recognition, I mean obviously we recognize individual for the contribution and so on, but the mindset from day one is think about and result, how cross functional team can achieve that and it doesn't matter if the team wins, everybody wins, right? That that I think is, I wish something that I have a real life experience tasting when I was a student, it would make my adjustment from from academia to real life industry a lot easier. I think the wonderful thing is these days most of the students get a lot of opportunities to work on teams and which is a little different than when you and I were both in school. So let me open up to questions who has a question, yeah back there and what we're going to do is repeat the question because I think for the mics. So can you just repeat the questions? Okay the first question if I understand it is is it in general a hopeful case that because the incumbents are so busy with the inertia that is keeping the success that the small companies should rightfully have a hope to get a crack in some of the business that they either architecturally or the business momentum don't allow them to address is that the the gist of the first question? Yeah so so I would say the most important thing is to divine success right I mean because of our transaction oriented nature the short term oriented nature because we are in America in Silicon Valley sometimes we focus too much on initial successes right because you know a hundred company get funded maybe I don't know four get IPO and so when you IPO you feel like that you you had the success but you think about it right a Ruben reported 41.7 million dollars the last quarter okay Cisco reported 9.3 billion right so is it a is is it something to celebrate that you can find a 41.7 million dollar crack in a in a 20 billion dollar environment to find that crack there then we've been many many ideas that are available for you to get those crack right the which points to one fact good ideas not difficult to find it is execution the operation excellence to get through to productization and marketing and and supporting your product that is important right so a lot of company fail not because they didn't find those crack right the four or five companies that go get IPO all of the hundred companies funded is it's not because they got the four or five best ideas I think probably a lot of them get the good idea but it's just a four or five of them has the tenacity and an operation management skill to get carried through now the fact that you carried through and form a bit of an initial success is by no means assurance of longevity of a company right which is kind of tied to the second question you ask which is what keeps me awake at night for a room right so in my view in my space of enterprise class network infrastructure for the large companies the fortune 500 and global 2000 companies a critical mass company in this space is roughly annual annualized for five hundred million dollars half a billion dollars I think and then you you can claim that you have established a franchise of some sort you have created an niche right in in this and it can be ongoing or else the big like I said the only reason that the big guys let the small guys move along is because they're too busy doing the big things okay and and so when but when you're big enough then it is then they no longer ignore you because now is not small enough for them they ignore so they will come in and they try to really point again at you and then if you're not careful you do not create your differentiated position your customer loyalty that is when companies start forth ring right they they they came out and they become two hundred three hundred million dollars a year and then they go away because now they're getting the attention of the big guys right so so I think people should define what success is then don't don't declare a rival too soon which is for both of my company that I took public one of my biggest concern is I keep reminding people that basically by going IPO we have passed the qualified wrong now we get to play right and don't don't walk around and feeling that we have arrived and don't put your stock price and your network on the screen screen screen saver title the stock price and so on and that is equally remaining vigilant and continuing to innovate and continue not to let that space that the initial success slow you down because you think about it we have now three thousand five hundred customers worldwide right compared to Cisco I don't know half a million how half a million customers now there is a startup behind us that I mean I could tell you that aside no off the motorboat companies that went around San Hill Road having a business plan that's called Rubah killer a Rubah 2.0 or whatever and you know all the nice names they do not have the inertia of the three thousand five hundred customers so at that scale my blessing is my curse right so how do I not lose my speed reddit to the guy who has half a million customers but not no computer use the speed to and agility you know but how do I not not let the other guy who is only 50 customer do one to me like I did to the other guy so I'm so that really is the job that I believe that the board is going to do yes so the question is you know in relationship to my comment about the IPO process is more about branding than bringing in cash how does that help in customer acquisition in the sense that when the technical teams recommend in an account that they want to go a Rubah how do we inference the executives right so I think well first of all I'm not saying that we don't like that hundred million dollars that that we brought in that's just in the back the ultimate thing in people's mind they people have more problems in the jobs than they're just creating a wireless network right so you have to make people feel okay I'm taking problems off your plate I'm not creating problem and another anxiety for you right so so you have to go in and understand at a CIO a cheap marketing office and so on point what is this what what is the solution what helped them at their level right it's a CIO's major problem operation expense control because the you know the the corporate top line's being squeeze or his charter is to use IT as a competitive advantage and so on so the first most important thing before you go in and see an executive is to understand from their perspective what are they looking for and I think a lot of high tech marketing people forget it's not about you it's about them right because they they they have the budget so that that that that is the key thing so when we go into the CXO and so on if they are functional executive meaning in the head of sales have a proactive arm and so you have to understand what's the pain point right and and and they have to have enough pain point for them to say I want to overcome the anxiety of anything new fundamental people don't you know like anything new except maybe cars or clothes and so on so that is the the main thing right and you have the CFO and the CIO and it'll be different industry you have to you have to address them that way another question yeah so I kind of want to go back to where I've started where you said that you got some of some of the experience you got from HP so I'm trying to what you're doing now so I kind of want to know what are your what are your HP values and how would you fight them to a small business and which ones do you think they're not there you're not work well I think if you you know there's a book by Dave Packard code HP or the question is a little bit more detail explanation of how HPWAK can be applied in the startup environment and and of all the HP way values what tend to work and what not so so better right not as well um I mean off they they do three days seminars on subjects like that and for me I just focused there I think if you get a book written by Dave Packard wrist mobile code HPWAK and you look into it there was like seven or eight value putting there I just pick on you know one or two and I blend it in in in in one area which I find work again and again is fundamentally give you employees respect you know dignity and and associated with that trust so that they feel empowered and to go on and innovate and and through that process kick off the passionate part of the the brain and from then on it's kind of uncontrollable right then you get the the energies all of that and the reason that I think that it work very well is um is that because people are people you know whether you work in a startup where where you know a large company if you go down to to to that level of psychology is no difference the thing that I found you know I have my scars on my back as well that that in the OXP way that in the execution of that that has less tolerance in the outside of XP environment is how much time you give you when you know people when they want to test them out obviously you want to give them long and long the road if it doesn't work out how do you the feedback cycle right on uh I think at least in the XP that I left we tend to give people too much benefit of the down you know if something doesn't work try this try that and and and what you find in a startup environment since time is such a big sense and you don't have the inertia to carry you uh for for for mistakes right um the the flip side of the uh being able to go fastest when you tank you tank there's no inertia okay and so what by one one of my first error and and I remember that uh there was after I left XP and I know I want to do a small uh start up but at that point in time I was managing thousand of people and I don't want to jump to many 30 people so I choose an environment in bay that I manage a small section and and I really was not happy with my performance there because I fundamentally do not appreciate suddenly now I have I have I don't have any inertia to help me now inertia is there but it's much smaller and I think I give the feedback cycle too long so I think that is the one caution from experience uh that that that I learned that I want I want to show you right yeah um I was wondering what your uh how do you feel that your advanced scientific degree impacted your abilities or your research and management business okay so the question is um uh how do I feel about my advanced uh uh scientific degree uh my master's in PhD in uh helping my management in business is that correct okay so um first of all I try not to let people know um because the needle could do it and PhD not I don't think uh that's right uh I would say you know if you ask a lot of people who've gone through the the PhD thing and and then I'm in management uh they would say well you train me in my analytical capability the question and so on uh that that is true but it is very generic you can go through a lot of other route to gain that analytical for me being in way I was I was very very lucky to be working with why both I was in physics at Caltech and when I was the neurobiology in Caltech I was working with people who's pushing the stay of the art of their research through that observation of just how people handle question was to scope of the problem that uh that they handle uh that they they they want to ask um uh give me one major psychological insight that I think a lot of uh uh my counterparts do not have it is the courage to face uncertainty okay a lot of people just not comfortable when you are actually at the edge you know when you have a business plan they say okay how do you define your market what's your objective well how many mark points of market share uh the in year two of your business plan you cannot ship the answer if you're a good entrepreneur say if you if you already can segment that market that well and predict in two years what's your market share it's not worth going the big the big guns are already going at it right so the only way you can have a chance to succeed is to go for area where it cannot be defined actually being segmented and a lot of people just not comfortable with that but but in your scientific pursuit of science really good scientific research that is exactly where you you want to go and another thing is the flip side of that is you're not afraid of failing and then having it to restart right i mean that that that comes hand hand in hand uh but you cannot get locked in too long and that is really where another aspect of the brutal intellectual honesty come in uh another aspect of that other than just applying it at the at the at the staff level is at the executive level is you want to invoke you know when you are in territory like that you need the courage and how do you how do you derive the courage that you derive the courage by having a passion passion is right from a vision right and vision vision the good visions is uh that you are ahead of the game those are the good visions right and that means you could be that wrong a lot of people the problem they have is they because they need that courage they have to invoke the sight themselves up so to speak right and so so when you work on something the people don't see and then you wake up in the morning i have gone through many times i drive the work i don't know whether a visionary or some the grandest delusionist in the Silicon Valley right and i i fluctuate within the month several times depending on that working on the hot end and the people are really a little bit of suffering so so my my my my point is the whole scientific training of pursuit of truth and that truth the case and i'm not afraid if you look at a wrong answer to go back and find another one and and that brutal brutality you apply to yourself to be totally driven by intellectual integrity if you are wrong after two and a half years of digging down and getting the product say sorry go back rather than waste another two and a half years by justifying to yourself because you're not ready to give up the previous investment so i i think that's uh does a key insight great thank you very very much i know Jeff has a presentation Jeff and Kimber of a presentation for you we actually have three thank yous to say and the first is to come in or for his wonderful insight today so thank you
