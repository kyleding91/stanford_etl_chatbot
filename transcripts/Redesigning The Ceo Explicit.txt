 Who you are defines how you built. This is the OddPairer thought-leaders series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. On this episode, we're joined by Sarah Nahn, co-founder and CEO of Leather, a talent recruitment platform. At Leather, Sarah has worked hard to build a company around diversity and inclusion, achieving a 50-50 gender balance while expanding the company to more than 40 countries and 2000 customers. Here's Sarah. I don't know about any of you, but 10 years ago, I feel like Stanford actually was a really different place for entrepreneurship. My freshman year was the first year that Facebook was available to incoming students. This notion of the young entrepreneur wasn't even really a concept. Very quickly in that period, we went through all this incredible transformation in the tech industry. We obviously saw the rise of the hacker in a hoodie. We saw this incredible transformation of a whole bunch of industries. We also saw the 2008 bubble come in for tech. Really, I think coming out of that, we had a lot of really incredible mythologies about technology. I think the whole world was looking at Silicon Valley and they saw these paradigms, these tropes, these stereotypes, what it meant to be a successful entrepreneur. There was, I think, a prevailing idea that you had a ton of confidence that you walked around with this vision that propelled you into the future and you didn't care what anybody else had to say or think about it. I think now when you scan the headlines, there's a really different story about that kind of entrepreneurship. I'm super excited to be up here because I personally feel really passionately that we as stewards of a technology community, we need to create a much richer and more diverse set of role models for leadership. Not said lightly because, frankly, following a pattern of success, like the pathway that others have created, that's literally the way that venture capitalists make investments. That's literally why a lot of you are probably showing up to hear from someone like me, to hear about the wisdom and the knowledge or the people that came before you. It's scarier and it's harder to invent a different template for success. It's actually riskier and it puts more of yourself at stake to actually go out there and try to lead in a way that is different. I've had that tension and conflict in a lot of my key moments that I've had leading up to where I am today. I'm hoping to share some of that with you overall. If I were to just describe what my journey has been, it's very much been about learning to reinvent myself but to actually have ownership over that. It's been learning how to believe in others who believed in me. Lastly, I think it's about learning how to kind of tie my own success to creating success for others. That's really been the three chapters of my journey to get to speaking in front of you today. If that's what we're going to cover, I do want to at least do a little bit of an introduction. If 11 years ago I was sitting here at Stanford, where was I to get to that point? I grew up all over the US. You probably wouldn't guess where I'm from. I'm from Birmingham, Alabama, deep south. I was one of two non-white people in my high school in a deeply segregated community. I think growing up there taught me a ton about respecting kind of differences in the world and the different points of view. By the way, in Alabama, nobody went to work in technology. Nobody certainly went west to California to go to school. When I found my way out here, it was so interesting. It was the most diverse community I have ever been in. I think when I came to Stanford, there was just so much coming together in terms of ideas, different people, coming from different places. I ultimately found a home in the design program here. Oh my gosh, design was so much. I felt like I was using all parts of my brain. It was like you were combining technology and engineering with business and then also psychology and art. And for me, that was just like a huge kind of transformation for me, which I can talk about later. And then ultimately graduating from Stanford, I thought I was for sure going to go down this kind of design path, but kind of took me by surprise, ended up in technology and spent my first few years out of college at Google during a big growth period for them, doing a lot of different things. I was a speech writer from Rissamire and then went and spent a lot of time doing growth for the Chrome browser. And quit Google, much to the sugar in my parents, spent a few years wandering in the wilderness to eventually found lever. A lot of people asked me how did I found lever? Really, founding a company is, for me at least, it was something that caught me by surprise. And I think that probably the first thing that I would impart to you is how you make choices in your life really is such a defining characteristic of your leadership. So for better or for worse, every time I face a juncture in my life, I look down one path and you can see it really clearly, you can see it all mapped out, you know exactly how it's going to go. And then there's this other path and it makes no sense and you can't see anything about it. I always choose the second path. And so I had been pretty comfortable at Google. I'd been growing a lot in my role. I'd gotten to work with some incredible people. And then I chose to leave. And I think I chose to leave because I didn't know what would happen. And I knew that at that point in my life, having been on this straight and narrow path of Stanford and then Google, I wanted to put myself in a position where I'd have to take real agency over my choices and over my life. And I don't know if any of you have had that chance to really be put in a position where the only thing nudging you forward is going to be you taking that step and you kind of making a concrete decision. And so I cut myself off from all the paths. And in doing that, I really discovered a lot about myself. And I think the probably the number one skill that I discovered about myself was how to design myself and how to redesign myself. And that has been a skill that I use constantly because as CEO at Leather, I have to reinvent myself and my job every six months. And so what it was like in that period was really trying to understand what I valued, what I saw in the world, what resonated. And I think more than anything, the people that I gravitated to and the values we might share together. So at that time, I was working with a lot of different entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley on a lot of different problems. Just putting myself in situations, right, how to see how I'd react and see kind of what I would end up gravitating to. And I ended up falling in with some old friends of mine, some folks I knew from Stanford and Google. And we had kept in touch through the same burning man camp. Who would eventually become my co-founders at Leather? And there's all these mythologies that exist about how companies get founded and I'll be super honest, none of those myths applied to us. When we found ourselves together, we were really just three people. We didn't know anything about what we wanted to do. We didn't know anything about some big vision that we had for the world. But we did know that we were really attracted to a change that was happening in the world. And really for us at that time, the change that was happening in the world was inside of every organization. We saw this really big shift where you used to kind of work at a job to get paid. And then suddenly people were working jobs to make a difference. And they were working jobs to have impact. They were working jobs to grow. I basically would have conversations with all my friends and were often the not. We would talk about whether we were fulfilled in our work. And that's a huge change from our parents generation, the generation before that. And really I think if I zoom out and talk about it from a macro, cultural macroeconomic standpoint, what we had stumbled upon was like there was a literal generational shift happening in the workforce. Millennials were running the workforce with a completely different set of cultural values. You also saw the nature of work really changing as technology transformed every single industry out there, the types of work that was happening out there. Airlines were now software and logistics companies, hotel chains were now actually experienced companies. Work was really changing and the people doing the work was changing. And that's essentially the kernel of what would become lever. So for those of you who don't know, lever is a company in the hiring and recruitment space. So we build the software that other organizations use to run an entire end-to-end talent strategy. Of course, if any of you have ever looked for a job, you might have actually used lever. We power a lot of the job pages that are online. So when you apply to a job, that's just the tip of the iceberg of all the software that we have behind the scenes to help an organization run the entire process that it takes to bring talent into the organization. And I think what we decided to think about that problem differently was to recognize that this wasn't a transaction. It wasn't like you used to post a job and you hire somebody. But there was actually kind of the relationship that people were having to organizations. And it was getting more complex and it was getting richer. And nobody had really entered that space to create what would eventually be like a talent relationship management solution. And long story short, we saw an opportunity there. So that's a little bit about lever. But really, I think what I'm telling you all this is to tell you that's the glossy kind of story what it felt like at the time was completely different. We had no idea what we wanted to do. And what we ended up doing, and maybe this is the design program at Stanford influencing us was to go learn from other people what it was all about. So our first nine months as a company we spent embedded inside of hyper growth companies, mostly technology companies, watching them as they went through incredible amount of scale. So we were really employing like kind of like user research methods and sort of like almost like anthropological style observation to make sure that we weren't the entrepreneurs that were just saying this is what we think is happening in the world and then like blindly following it. We chose instead to actually observe and watch kind of the entire process of what it really took for an organization to hire and study that patiently for nine months in order for us to even get an inkling on what we wanted to do or how we're going to disrupt something or how we're going to be different. And in doing that I think we founded the company on a premise of really debunking this idea of like the startup founder that has this like idea descending from the mountain and really kind of embracing the humility of being innovative through listening and being innovative through empathy and being innovative through our ability to believe in other people's ability to see the future. And I think that's why for me like believing in other people is a huge mechanism where I have entrepreneurial success. You know I think that a lot of our mythologies about startup founders tell us that these are people that you know are just relentlessly in pursuit of some sort of inner vision that comes from inside of them. But I personally have really embraced multiple times in my career the idea of like drawing from others and being more connected to others being the strength of my superpower so to speak. And certainly when it comes to literally innovation and literally coming up with new ideas for you know founding a company or building a new product we found that you know embedding ourselves inside of organizations and studying the way that they hired was in fact a really really profound way for us to start the company. So we got our start in you know roughly 2012, formed the team in 2013 we sort of actually found our own offices, exited that research period, started building the company. And you know really I think those early days it's really fascinating. So you know I said that reinventing yourself is like a huge part of what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur. I think that early startup days really reveal why. So nowadays we say that I'm the founder and CEO at lever but actually neither of those things were really true at the beginning. When I first joined lever I actually just joined as a team member. I was a designer that was my title at head business cards we thought we were very fancy because we had business cards. And you know as a designer I obviously was a huge part of that you know process of doing the user research and of that process of creating kind of a sense for what our product would be and what we would build the company around. But actually my co-founder Nate was our CEO and he and very much embodies kind of the stereotype or the myth of what a great startup CEO looks like. He is a engineer who is you know very like dapper tall he's very tall you know white guy very charming very persuasive very confident he's actually also really awesome like I do really love my co-founder and you know we kind of had like all the markings of a great you know stereotypical engineer Google PM like male CEO. But I think what ended up kind of happening in this period is really revealing and I think for me you know what I would impart to everybody is I hope it stands to show that leadership in many ways is what you decide to do and what choices you make rather than you know kind of being being born into it. So you know we started kind of working quite a bit on developing the product and of course as a designer is literally doing design at the time. But then since I knew our early users I also became kind of like the first person to you know once we got people on our actual platform like make sure that we were closing the feedback loop making sure that we were hearing kind of like how is it going where the like the next things that we could build partnering with them. Since I knew our early customers then I went and found more customers so I quickly found myself building out our very early go to market engine. And you know that this is around the time that we're about six eight people really hustling but we hadn't really taken down any serious funding yet so everything's just like racing to get to the point where we built enough of a business that we could actually raise some serious venture capital and become like a real business. So we were like all hands on deck pounding super hard trying to build this business and then you know my co-founder who's our you know engineer Google PM kind of co-founder like super-mired in all the feature requests that we had to deliver on for our customers. So we had that rhythm of like me running the business him running the product we had the whole team around us obviously and then when it came to fundraise it was sort of funny because my co-founder is a CEO but he didn't know anything about our revenue about our numbers about our customers about any of the things that the investors ultimately would care about. So we decided all right let's go after this together and we fundraised together we got several term sheets in a competitive round from our series A but it was really it was really fascinating because that whole period you know I still had my business cards that said designer and you know people would be like super confused like why is this designer in the room and like why is this person like here right now like trying to basically pitch us and even in some cases you know when I would be on email threads with Nate they would think I was his EA when he would see see me so they would just sort of like be like oh yeah my calendar blah blah and it was just such an interesting experience because you know at the end of the day like Nate and I knew what we were doing and we would be driving all up and down 280 going from San Francisco to San Hill Road and you know he he like really gave me a lot of sanity like really like partnered with me in acknowledging that that was like a super weird thing. But why why wouldn't a designer be welcome in the room? Why wouldn't someone you know who wasn't the CEO still be able to like legitimately lead the business right? But this really all came to a head for us when when really around that same time you know my we we had all these we were lucky we were able to actually successfully get you know several offers from VCs we did ultimately kind of pick one and we started to work with them and between signing a term sheet and actually getting the cash in your bank account there's actually this period with the lawyers are doing stuff so we were in that period and it's a really happy period because you're planning for the future you now know that you're going to be scaling the business growing the business. So Nate and I were locked basically up in this the one conference room that our office had and planning all these things for the business is a really great time and I had it in my head that you know oh we were going to hire like a head of sales and I'd like hand off you know all this business stuff and then go back to being a designer. So then our third co-founder Randall who had the segment at our company all hands for a number of years called getting real with Randall so you can imagine what kind of co-founder he is he was always sort of a guy who spoke like to truth and he he had this wisdom about him so Randall kind of comes into this this conference room to to interrupt us and he goes guys there's something wrong and I think if we don't fix this you know the company will probably fail and if the company fails you might as well not take the money like we'll buy we should we're just like Randall we're listening tell us tell us what's wrong and he goes the wrong person CEO and you know I think what Randall was speaking to is just this like this choice that we had as a company as a founding team as a culture frankly about whether we would kind of continue in this model call it like the Sheryl Sandberg to the Mark Zuckerberg model or whether we would just write you know like write this situation and actually just sort of make make this switch there's a lot of companies where engineers and technical founders are like the CEOs of businesses but we were a B2B SaaS software company and for the most part you know building the business is like kind of like the the job definition of being CEO and it was really decisive for us I think as a company it was probably our first diversity and inclusion moment it was sort of the first time we had to really ask ourselves you know what kind of you know culture do we want to be what kind of values do we want to have and you know frankly Nate it took him like 30 hours what he came in he's like I think it's the right thing it's like the way to go and for me it took me like 10 days which in seed stage startup time is like infinity of kind of wandering around in this like weird headspace because I had never saw myself being a CEO being a founder being a leader all of this had happened kind of incrementally over time and I think that's where I kind of come back to you know this idea of believing in others that believe in you you know I think for the people that already know they want to be founders of companies entrepreneurs CEOs great that is awesome but there's more people out there who can be those leaders that don't think of themselves that way today and I was once one of them and I think in that moment of like wandering through this like metaphorical desert trying to figure out this choice that I had to make and what it meant and what I wanted and what I was going to do you know I kept like ultimately returning to the people around me and how much I valued them and their beliefs and the things they had sacrificed things they had like put on the line the you know the team that had joined and like had signed up to work on this like what wasn't that much more than an idea with their passion and their talents and their skills and then also our customers like all the people who like rationally should not have been our software and relying on it to do all their recruiting they had backed us and they had they had thrown their weight behind us because of how much they believed in literally in us as people and I think a lot of people asked me so what was going through your head what made you decide to say yes it wasn't because I saw myself in that role it was because all these people around me that I trusted really profoundly saw me succeeding in that role so 10 days later you know I shuffle into the office and I tell Nate and Randall okay thought about it let's do this here we go and you know they thought obviously it was a great idea their support as co-founders really meant a lot to me and then of course we had to tell the team and that was a big milestones we like hemmed and hot about it we tried to figure it out and eventually like sort of got everybody together and told everybody and the team was just like oh yeah that makes sense okay and like went back to it we're like okay but then we actually we're still in this period right where we had signed the term sheet but we hadn't gotten the cash so we had to tell our investor he was Dana Stalter he's a general partner matrix partners they've been in the VC business for you know over two decades really fantastic person really fantastic firm so we had to tell Dana and you know actually that was like that was we were like oh no this is like material information we really have to tell people this but does this is this gonna like basically blow up the deal is this gonna make him kind of question like what else are you hiding from me or you know what else you know do I not know or have you have you not told me and you know we had another moment we're like okay maybe we should just wait and not do this now it was again one of those critical choices we're deciding what kind of a company we were gonna be and whether this was the right thing to do or whether you know that it was just another one of those moments and you know we ended up just saying like fuck it like we have to we have to be you know this kind of founding team and this is the decision that we have to make so not knowing whether this would completely blow up the entire company and everything we'd worked for we invited Dana over we sat him down in the one conference room we had this whole thing prepared and so we sat him down we like all told this whole story and Sarah should be CEO and it was one of those moments that I don't even remember well I think I blacked out a little bit because I was so stressed out but like time just like stretches out that sort of thing but you know what what ultimately happened is you know Dana kind of looks at me feel like he's seeing me for the first time and he just leans over and he goes girl power high five so needless to say you know for us at least it was the right choice it was the right choice and it was the hard choice like harder for me I think stepping into that was really me making a huge choice about choosing to see myself in a way that I I couldn't see myself on my own and choosing to redefine my idea of who I was and what I could contribute in a way that I hadn't before and I think that's the beauty of entrepreneurship I think that's what attracts talented smart driven people to this painful nebulous like journey of being an entrepreneur because it sucks like just saying it in many ways it totally sucks you you make sacrifices you make sacrifices with your your time and your wellness and your sanity and you know to some degree if you're lucky to actually have you know levers now 200 and 25 people we have two offices in San Francisco and Toronto we have over 2500 customers we've raised 73 million in capital we are all in all like you know really on a path to success and I've definitely have to say like once you have that I mean then you know there's there is so much responsibility that comes with that and there's there's a lot of pressure and there's a lot of sacrifice but why we choose to still be entrepreneurs and why we choose to still be on that journey is because there's just no other way to put yourself in these definitive moments where the choices that you make are just so clearly creating who you are and I think that you know for me is again coming back to kind of my maybe passion or the thing that I I really care about a lot nowadays is I think there's more stories to be told in entrepreneurship and I think it's all too easy to tell the story that the world wants to hear and tell the story where you just like woke up one day and you knew you were going to be the effing like CEO of this like game changing disruptor startup and you know I actually you know my experience the experience of a lot of founders a lot of CEOs that I know is just so much more complex so much more human than that and I think what you know I would hope for all of you to take away from you know my story is really that you know at the end of the day it doesn't it doesn't matter nearly as much your ability to see yourself in your destination and I think what matters more is to put yourself in a path where you have to take risks and make choices and you know in many ways like we're so fortunate to be really in the heart of Silicon Valley where there's so many people to learn from where there's classes like this where there's you know other people you can look to as mentors but truly my experience has very much taught me that you know there there there's nothing that can replace your ability to put yourself in situations where you're not sure what you're going to do and where you're not sure what's going to happen and where you have people around you that you can trust to help you see bigger and more clearly and where you push yourself to actually you know I don't know I guess be something more than you thought you wanted to be or to do something more than you thought you wanted to do and I think that to me that's what authentic leadership is and to me I think if more people not only made those choices but shared the story of their choices we would pave the way for a lot more people to find their way to leadership and for a lot more people to you know be role models for the generation that will come after us so I'm happy to take questions and talk about pretty much anything do you think if you would have found out the copy not as well convalidant somewhere else who would have had the same results should I repeat the questions the question was if we had you know maybe gotten started or incubated outside of Silicon Valley would we have had the same question would we have formed the same company with the same results you know I I you know literally know I think like the situations you put yourself in really influenced you and the the the things you choose to study and and the models and templates that you're exposed to matter tremendously so absolutely not I think if we had exposed ourselves to different inputs we would have gotten a lot further however as we've scaled as a company we have very consciously brought in influences from other types of organizations other types of customers we've tried to mix in a lot of our influences so to speak to consciously brought in who we're serving and the impact that we can have in the solutions that we imagine are possible we obviously continue that design thinking kind of methodology in the company today to do all of our ongoing R&D into some degree even influencing other parts of the business so we are really conscious about diversifying the the models and the customers and the problems that we're exposed to so that we can keep keeping riching and broadening the solutions we can deliver great question yeah what is being the hardest part in using your company how do you do my business? the hardest part in building my company let's see people I have a feeling you're going to hear that from a lot of the entrepreneurs in the speaker series but you know there's kind of this idea about technology companies in particular that you know it's kind of all about these like systems and structures and like these these kind of sciencey things but you know a lot of it is about people and I think in particular as a CEO you are you are the storyteller of the business you're trying to tell the story of your company not just to your your prospective customers but to all the people inside the company you have to tell them what you're doing in a way that's that's simple enough that everybody can actually see themselves in it and can run as fast as possible in the same direction simplicity is really a superpower it's one I'm still refining it's one I'm still working on so you know I think the hardest part is being able to be a leader to larger and larger and larger sets of people who have greater and greater kind of diversity and what their jobs are what they care about are the tensions between them and to keep a company simple so that everybody can actually run in the same direction that's definitely the hardest part yeah well like the union co-founders started the company with the idea that you were inspired by the space you were talking about and so decided to do something about it or did you kind of want to do everyone want to start a company and then look for the closest space they were interested in that makes sense yeah I mean so the question is like did we where we inspired by the space and then made the company where there are other way like how did we like end up and the answer is like yes you know like I think I tried to convey this but maybe not vividly enough it's confusing at the beginning like you don't really know what you're doing you're I think like the most important thing you're doing is you're exposing yourself to a lot of interesting ideas and surrounding yourself with the people that really like draw out the kind of creativity and like you know ingenuity in in each other you know I think the most important thing you do in the early early stages is you find the people you want to work with and in many ways like finding the people that mesh with you does involve some degree like finding the problems in common or passion for problems in common we all for example loved working on the future of work that was something we were just naturally passionate about it drew us together it was something that was really obvious like you know in a time when everybody was building mobile apps and like companies that ended in .ny we were like all about B2B software and that was pretty rare and special and I remember that being like a huge draw for why my co-founders and I loved working together but yeah in the very beginning you don't really know what you're doing but the most important thing is to find the right people to go through that like exploration phase together with yeah I have two questions one is that HR is a highly competitive space and the high in and trench space was like big players and um so I was curious like what do you think may you guys successful and two is like do you think you would have been successful if you had just like bootstrapped or do you think actually getting funding was a because ultimately you care about getting customer money but like do you think you would have do you think getting funding actually get you in also with certain customers as well so it was a two-parter so the question was um with HR being a competitive space what made us succeed and then the second question is do I think venture capital was necessary for our success uh so you know juries out we haven't succeeded yet we're on this path I mean I guess I'll caveat with that HR is an interesting category I actually think all categories there's some degree of of um there's there's there's there's periods and waves of evolution I think actually HR technology is going through a wave that you know this happens every 15 20 years in every technology category so timing is really huge for picking when you focus on an area and whether or not you know you have a chance at success so I think for us what helped us um break through in a category that's very old like ever since there's been software there has been software to do our problem we're therefore in a replacement market and so we're selling something better a next generation version of something people already have not inventing something out of the blue so what helped us were these macroeconomic factors I mentioned that there's a new workforce that actually there's been this massive digital transformation of everything we do so you used to believe it or not like give a paper resume to an employer to evaluate them um you know obviously we digitized that into software and we digitized job ads into you know like monster.com and indeed in these these online platforms but there was another kind of wave of digital transformation where you know truly like one-to-one relationships uh the the rise of the relationship was definitely a concept that was driving and fueling like a completely different way for organizations to actually proactively reach out to people like send them emails send them linkedin some send them text messages in some cases to proactively engage talent instead of just like posting a job and getting applications so uh for us there were these macroeconomic factors that had changed about the world that had triggered this category to go through one of these transformations that do happen every so often uh and then whether or not venture capital is critical to our success you know I tell a lot of people there's a lot of ways to scale a company and um you know they're just really different and certainly if you go for a VC backed growth strategy I mean that's gonna drive and determine a lot of your priorities a lot of the decisions you make down the road I've enjoyed working with venture capital you know I can't even fathom a day when you you would like mortgage your house to be able to pursue like an idea I think venture capital gets a bad rep sometimes because there's all these stories about you know the fact that they're capitalists it's in the name people venture capitalists it's a clear it's a clear relationship I think it's all about being as selective with the VCs that you partner with as the people that you co-found your company with or the people that you hire you know I we have always like had the luxury of choosing kind of like who we want to work with and we've we've optimized for choosing with people that feel like people I want to work with for a decade and I think that makes a huge difference so I I personally have felt that you know we have liked being on that high growth venture backed path it's not without its challenges you do feel a little bit like you're on a treadmill but I think the key to making that successful is remembering that you know don't don't go for the brand names or the sexiness or whatever go like evaluate those people just like you would evaluate you know anybody that you were gonna work with yeah so you mentioned design for me like you said I you did stand for design program and I'm in love with design so how how how those skills help you hear oh my gosh uh question was how is design thinking helped me in my career gosh I could do a whole hour long talk about that um so I can't help but be a designer right it's like so much of how I formulated my way of solving problems my way of looking at the world my way of interacting with others it's what I try to bring to my CEO job to my to being a founder you know I think in a way you know I don't get to like literally design the product anymore much you know single tier um but what I do do is use basically the same skill set in designing my company so instead of user research I'm doing research but my employees and my customers and re-users and instead of the product being the product the product is you know our strategy the product is our culture the product is the company right and so I actually use the same skills I try to use um I I feel like a lot of design thinking is about how you listen to others and listen both to what people say and what they don't say or what they're trying to express uh identifying needs uh both explicit needs and latent needs and being able to actually articulate needs not necessarily solutions because as soon as you anchor on a solution it's the whole difference of I need a ladder versus I need to reach something on a high shelf right so I think being able to separate out needs and solutions and then being able to actually lead a lot of people in generating um lots of solutions different solutions alternative solutions that process is so huge because when you have cash limitations bandwidth constraints like when you don't have that higher with the explicit skill set you got to generate a lot of solutions because basically you don't have any ladders around and so being able to think as creatively about our team and our culture and like how we solve the problems that we have with the people and skills that we have uh that is very much a design thinking exercise and I think the other thing I take away from design thinking is the importance of storytelling and I've kind of mentioned this earlier but you know in many ways giving people the capability to see something that doesn't yet exist such a huge part of the value that I can drive and the value I can give to the team and I do think something I love about design thinking and if you have the chance to take design classes here at Stanford you should it changed my life no promises for you but uh I would definitely say that there's just this critical need to inspire other people in that design thinking discipline and that is just so valuable uh to entrepreneurs yeah um how would you say that you're working with like Google maybe kind of hope to you know what are your thoughts that are working and more stable? So the question was um what was it like working at a kind of corporate environment before going into a startup? You know I feel really lucky that when I was in Google I had a lot of really diverse experiences some of them were very much being a part of a big kind of like machine I was part of the team that took Chrome to market and that was like a big effort and we definitely had some amazing people that whole initiative was led by Sundar and so I got to see just like top-notch people at the top of their game but my first-ever job at Google was a great lesson in entrepreneurship because um it was essentially speech writing uh for Merse Meyer uh she was a VP of search and user experience at the time and nobody had ever had this job and they had no idea what it would be and I had I had no idea why I was doing it or why I had been selected to do it and it was this great experience for someone who had been at Stanford and had just been on this like achievement path for like such a long time to suddenly be in a job that was entirely subjective that you could not succeed at no matter how hard you tried. Copping with ambiguity was probably the most valuable thing that I got to experience early in my career that I think was hugely fundamental for my success as an entrepreneur and you know I think you can do that no matter what environment you're in if you're in a corporate environment just seek out situations where there isn't a path they're everywhere like at level we have them everywhere and like people just have to kind of pursue them so I think it's more frame of mind and um you know I would definitely say why I went to Google is just following great people so if you follow great people no matter what types of companies or environments they are I think you will learn a lot.
