 You were listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at edcorner.stanford.edu. We have my wonderful honor to introduce Martin Eberhard right now. He is the co-founder and president of technology of Tesla, where they're making a battery powered electric car. Sounds really amazing. I know we tried really hard to get a car here, but we couldn't pull enough strings, but we did get posters. And hopefully some of you have picked up three posters outside. Now Martin has a wonderful background. He has 20 years of experience as an entrepreneur. He is a co-founder of Nuo Media and also as a co-founder of network computing devices. But he also, like many of you in the room, is an engineer by training. He did his undergraduate work at the University of Illinois, both in CS and then electrical engineering. So without further ado, Martin. Well, thanks. Is this a micro-feed? You guys can hear me in the back? No. I'm on now. Ah, that's better. So I've been accused of being a serial entrepreneur. I don't know. These guys have serial entrepreneurs. I mean, look what they did. Well, anyway. Okay, I started a few companies. And along the way, I've learned a few lessons. And some of the lessons I've learned I continued to learn over and over again. And maybe this more to learn. I thought I'd tell you the story of tests and motors. And along the way, point out some of the lessons I've learned as an entrepreneur now here in Silicon Valley for a few years. And I'd like to start off with just my first lesson, which is to do something meaningful. You know, when I started my previous company making electronic books, it was in an era when the San Hill Road investors were investing in websites and they were valuing companies based on click counts. And I was making a piece of hardware trying to sell that. It was nearly impossible. And now, imagine walking up and down San Hill Road and going into a venture capital and saying we're going to make cars. You could hear the laughter around the valley. That funny sound you heard about four years ago, that's what that was. But to me, the only way that I can ever be successful at something is to work in something that I actually care about. And this time around, the something meaningful I cared about was oil consumption. It was becoming, to me, increasingly clear that we had to do something about our oil consumption, both from a global warming perspective and from an ashless security perspective. And it was interesting to know, as I got to ask around and talk to people and so on, that this is a problem that appeals to both ends of the political spectrum. I like to put this slide up and say, one of these pictures here you identify with and the other one pisses you off. I actually don't care which one it is. But this is an interesting time when something like electric car appeals to both ends of the spectrum. Obviously, the oil we use is used primarily for transportation and the low hanging fruit within transportation is cars, that's where we use them. And so I said about to see what I could do about that. There were a lot of technologies on the table four years ago as I was looking about and I came at this not as a electric car enthusiast at all, but rather just somebody looking for a solution to the problem, I did a lot of homework and I used these three questions as my metrics to say, which is the right technology, which we would be doing to try to reduce our oil consumption. And it's about emissions and petroleum usage. And when you do the math, in the end it's very clear that electric cars are by far the best choice because they are far more efficient than other modes of transportation and because they move the choice of your fuel, the ultimate fuel upstream from the car. You can make your electricity any way you want to. You can make it by burning coal. You can make it by clean technology ways like solar. You can even as an individual choose to put solar panels on the roof of your own house and make your own solar energy for your car. There had been electric cars around, you probably remember, and this is the remains of the EV1s that were crushed by General Motors when they took them back. GM had their excuses about why they did that. But there was a ring of truth to what they said that these cars didn't appeal to more than just the tree hudders and the geeks. And I thought about that a bit and I said, why is that? And can we make a car that's an electric car that appeals to people who love cars? And I say, okay, imagine the porous. I'm dangerous when I get graphics editing tools. But can we make an electric car that appeals to people that love cars? And that's what I set out to do. And maybe that's my next big lesson is be bold. And also I think that a key element to be a successful entrepreneur is a certain amount of naivety because if you actually know how hard the problem is when you set out you won't do it. The other side of the coin is the hard problem is always the interesting ones. So we set out to start Tesla Motors in the middle of 2003. This is half the company there. And that's the whole office. As I go through the presentation, I'm going to run across the top line, the date of the particular slide and as the company grows how big it is. I'm not going to talk about that much, but if you're interested in kind of a timeline, watch that as I go through. So I started off looking at efficiency and performance and so forth. And this is a slide that's taken out of one of my early, early presentations showing that electric cars offer you the opportunities to break the compromises you otherwise have to make between performance and efficiency. These are all the cars that are high performance, Lausy efficiency. These are all the cars that are highly efficient, Lausy performance. And electric cars get off the curve. Did my mic just fine? Do you guys still hear me? I wonder what that's all about. That's how we go again. Yeah, so we began looking hard at the technology. We looked at motor technology, battery technology and looking to see which technology would make sense, particularly battery space. And what would these batteries be able to do? We used Google to do some high class marketing. We didn't do a lot of expensive surveys for sure. We looked around at what the competition space looked like. I got to learn all about this ugly word homologation, which is the art of making the car legal in some particular entity. And you read the federal motor vehicle safety standards and you wonder, you stop wondering why nobody started a car company a long time. It's a heck of a lot of stuff you have to go through. We knew that as a couple of Silicon Valley engineers, we didn't have the wherewithal to design the entire car ourselves. We knew that we would like to work with an OEM partner to do the rest of the car part of our next car. We looked around at what kind of companies would be appropriate. And Lotus was the obvious winner for us because of a lot of factors, but largely because they made a car, those are the right form factor, the right size, the company was the right size. And their car already met the DOT requirements for selling in the US. I did a, I guess, the Silicon Valley thing to do. I went to the LA Auto Show and rudely elbowed my way into the Lotus booth until I found something whose name badge I recognized and told him my story and he was polite enough to invite me out to England to tell a story to the rest of the team. And I succeeded in convincing them that they might like to do business with a couple of crazy Silicon Valley artists. We didn't begin thinking about how we might package the drivetrain components that we were designing into a car that size. And by February of 04, I had finished the first version of our business plan. And it was a complete business plan, not just the technical side, but marketing data and so on. And I guess what the lesson I've learned here is that there comes a point where you had to put the naivety aside and think your idea all the way through. And again, in the beginning part of my career, business plans were required to raise money. And then they went completely out of fashion and fundraising was based on a PowerPoint presentation and maybe a two page executive summary. I recommend writing a business plan anyway, even if nobody else reads it because it makes you clarify your thinking. It makes you think the problem all the way through and explain it in a way that makes sense. And if it doesn't make sense, maybe your idea doesn't. With a business plan, I did the VC shuffle up and down Sand Hill Road. And as I said, walking into a VC that was previously investing in pets.com or whatnot, and suggesting that we're going to actually build a factory and make cars was quite hysterical. But they did want to go for a drive in whatever prototypes we might bring by. And quite a few of them have turned into the customers. From the day that I finished that first copy of the business plan, to the day that I had $7.5 million in the bank was six weeks. That was a record fundraising round, partly by blind luck. I ran into a guy that had an interest in the field and had the money. And also, Adventure Capital firm that had invested in my previous company and made money. We began styling studies. And we began looking very hard at how to package batteries. The crazy idea at the heart of Tesla Motors was to use the commodity lithium ion batteries that are inside the battery pack of our laptop computers and use those a lot more of them on a car to power the car. Because the energy density is very high on these things and because it's a commodity market and the price of these things is being driven down the quality up every day by companies like Apple and Dell and the rest of them. We opened our first real office in July and we're able to put the get a machine shop and the like so we could start actually building prototypes and started working on how to package these small cells, this is the early design of our battery pack. And the rest of the system was being designed on the computers. And in late net year in November we bought an Italian version of the Lotus Elise. There was here in this country that Lotus had brought over as a demonstration vehicle, but they couldn't sell it because it was not smog legal here. So they sold it to us cheap and I took a sawzall to it. It was a perfectly good car. The rest of our guys are scared to touch it so I got to do that. And we hired four different automotive stylists to give us bids on what they thought the car ought to look like. And these are actual photos from the four different stylists. And the winner was a guy named Barney Hat, a young guy in the Lotus design studio. We like what he had to do and he's the guy that did the styling for our car. We immediately started carving clay. This was an eye-opener for me that today in this world of computer design, car designers usually carf clay still. But first we made a quarter scale clay. You know, I did a size look at that knife compared to the wheel. And just about then we got our first mule car running. I'm sorry about that, not just sound. Sorry about the crummy video, but that was the actual first time that car ever drove and that was shot with somebody's cell phone. So it's a, it is what it is. It's an authentic first time it drove. The clay was finished, that hummin's bad, so too bad. This sounds not that important. The clay was finished by February and covered with this material called Dinock which makes it look sort of like it's painted. This is our quarter scale model. And between a driving prototype and a clay model that shows what the car is going to look like was the next step that allowed me to do my next round of fundraising. We brought in another investment firm at that point. And immediately opened our UK office. The folks at Loas were having what the Quaint English word is a redundancy, which means they're firing a bunch of people. And I took advantage of that and hired a bunch of very good automotive engineers out of their ranks. Actually, I wasn't just hiring the ones that had been fired, which kind of got them out of me. I eventually rented one of these buildings on the Loas campus. And we now have about 35 engineers there between body and chassis engineers and then manufacturing and quality engineers as well. And about that time, as a condition of doing business with Tesla, Loas required us to adopt their highly formal new product introduction process. And it's a formalized process. It's been honed over decades of developing cars through several car companies. They reach into not just the technical aspects of designing the car, but finance and marketing and after sales service and everything else, all worked out at all the things you have to do. And there are nine what they call gateways along the way where we get together in a room and we review how we are on each of the parts of the program, according to where they should be by the spec, and decide whether we've made the gateway or not. And the requirement they put on us was that they would attend those gateway meetings as a referee and had the right to say, no, you didn't pass try again. This was their way of covering their own behinds with respect to liability. They wanted to make sure that they could stop us if they think it thought we were not making a safer reliable car. This is a huge pill swallow for a Silicon Valley company where we fly by the sea of the pants for an awful long time. But on the other hand, it is exactly what has made us into a real car company and not just another bunch of guys in the garage with a welder. And I guess the lesson I learned here along the way is to remember that you're building a company too. I've now had to have this talk for the company quite a few times to say that we're making this car and that's great, but we're also making a company. And the processes that we need to have in place today were completely unnecessary last year and will be inadequate next year. And this idea of building your company while you're building your product extends to more than just the kind of processes and controls you need in place. It extends to the culture of the company. The kind of little things that you do as a, you know, just to relieve the pressure become institutionalized. You know, we're going to go out and fry this and have a beer together. Do we have a party at the CEO's house on Christmas, whatever. These kinds of things become institutionalized and become the core of the culture of the company. So in a startup company, you kind of have to put a little thought into that and build the company too. So through March, we began doing real packaging into the car. This is actually very close to how the car wanted to be laid out in the end. And we started building a full scale play model. This is just, I mean, again, just unbelievable. These craftsmen carving clay with little sticks and checking it with a three dimensional probing device on their computer. Come may, we had a hard decision to make. We've been trying like crazy with all kinds of ideas to make headlights work using off the shelf units by just putting plastic around them. And they looked like frog eyes every time we did it. And the reason we didn't want to do a full on a headlight program, which we ultimately had to do is that that's a $600,000 program all by itself. Headlights are just expensive. But we finally made bittable and spent that money. We also became more and more concerned about Lotus' problem of the step of, look how high the sill is on this car. And watch her get out. She's been doing this many, many times. So tell me how graceful you think of it. Yeah. It's just trying to smile. So at this point in May, we're aware of this problem. But we're also aware that the reason the door sill is high there is because that is the main structural beam of the car. It's involved in chassis stiffness. It's involved in structure of the car. And a crash, both from a front crash and a side crash, it's a big deal to change that. By May, we started putting dinot there. It is. It's a customized mile on the play model. And that model is finished in June. And it looks a lot like a real car. Of course, you can stick your finger into it. And it weighs probably 4,000 or 5,000 pounds while you're at it. But we've got a good look at what the car looked like. And we also built a buck out of just carved out of a solid material to put into the wind tunnel for aerodynamic tuning, motor development in August. And we started to build a mule car to carry a real body that matched what we designed in clay. Mule car is a, they call it mules in the industry because a mule is an animal that doesn't reproduce, you see. So this is a lotus chassis that we hacked up and then put our own drive train in. And about in September, we decided we were going to bite the bullet and lower the door cells. And that meant redesigning the whole chassis. This is a chassis. And the way to look at this, the gray bits are the bits that have remained the same from Lotus. So not much remained anymore. The main rails, bottom rails, all the backstuffs, everything had to change. Very expensive. But it made that door cell a lot lower, a lot easier to get in and out of the car. And I guess the lesson I've learned on this, actually I haven't learned, but I keep trying to learn, is the face reality. The sooner you come to realize that this is a real problem, it's not going to go away by wishful thinking. The faster you're on to the past to correct the problem and getting going again. So here comes the mule body, made of fiberglass and lots of bondo sanded down very carefully and painted and was gorgeous. This was this breathtaking and a car after drove, drove for quite a few months. It was a bit fragile, a bit heavy, but you could really get an idea what the car was all about. In the meantime, we had finished the design of the chassis and began building a real car. This is a real prototype, meaning that it's all the parts on it were designed, were production intent design. It started building that car. We were coaxed into allowing our car to be in the movie who killed the electric car. How many of you folks saw that movie? How many of you folks didn't blink and actually saw the five seconds of our car at the end? It's not too many. A lot of work, a lot of effort for five seconds of video of our car driving by. But it forced us to think about coming out in the public letting people see what we're doing. We ran that prototype after the main chassis workers done down the assembly line at Lotus. That was a big gamble in our part because if we stopped the assembly line at Lotus because our car has a problem, all the Lotus is behind it, stopped too and we paid lots of money. So we took a gamble and did it and learned what it was like to run down the line. When we finished the EP in May and packed the thing into a crate and shipped it to California and to much fanfare and immediately it went into a, there's a Hoi D20 studio in San Francisco that does photography for just cars, RJ Moonewy's call and he did a photo shoot paid for by Wired Magazine. This guy took a whole pile of amazing photographs and Wired went through all these amazing pictures and picked the very worst one and then they did a crap job of printing and put it back in the magazine. But that was enough to allow us to do an extra round of fundraising and this time we brought in some big name venture capital firms to join the rest that we had. In the meantime we're continuing to build prototypes. This is I think EP 4 or 5 coming off the line. July we had our big public unveiling showed the car at an event we created down in Southern California with lots of Hollywood folks there and we raced these cars all over the place and took them out of the runway on the airport and got going terrifically fast on the runway with Hollywood stars in it and the police did all worked up but eventually we got the police on board. And then we came time for our first crash test. So we don't normally show these videos. This is the first 30 mile an hour ahead on collision and what matters on these tests is that the airbag opens in time. The G forces on our crash test dummy are within the legal requirements. After the crash the door opens correctly and a bunch of things like that but in the first crash it's actually a lot more than that. It's that when we watch the videos and the video takes from the top the bottom the sides every side and when we take the car apart that the car failed exactly as a computer model predicted because that gives us confidence that the rest of the modeling is going to be good. August that's something we showed for the first time at the fancy Concord elegance down in Pebble Beach with a huge amount of fanfare. This was just a, we were absolutely packed the whole time we were there. Right above the hill I call them the Maytag repairmen over at the Lexus booth. Nobody even looked at them at all. Lexus guys just watched our booth all day long. August we destroyed the clay model. Clay models don't last forever. They're expensive to keep around and we decided it was time for that one to go. And in August we started to realize that we were going to have problems with the transmission that our transmission supplier was failing us that these weren't working. They weren't going to be able to make a production. Remember what I said about lesson five? I didn't face it yet at this point. We started doing the Electromagnetic interference testing. This is a kind of cool shot. And then the hardcore durability testing. These are calibrated durability tracks. These cars drive on this. It's beat the heck out of them. They have hills and bumps and corners and salt water spray and hot and cold and so on. The idea is to try to tease out all the things that might break on a car when the general public drives it, mom before they see it. Here it is driving through salt water. And finally by November we bit the bullet and canned our transmission supplier and found another supplier to redesign it. It's not just make it the same thing over again but actually a redesign. Big deal. Still is a big deal for us. However we were invited to show the car in the San Francisco Auto Show. How many of you went to the San Francisco Auto Show? We had a great location. Those of you who were there really. The cool thing is when he came down the escalator in the Moscone Center and we were right there at the bottom of the stairs, we got that spot for free. The folks that put on the San Francisco Auto Show thought that if they had us there, that it would draw more people to the Auto Show and they offered it to us for free. So we couldn't resist. Similarly we're at the Los Angeles Auto Show this time at the invitation of Yokohama who wanted to associate their brand with ours. It's kind of funny because they're much bigger brand than we are. And I participated in a press conference with the governor and a bunch of the Muckney mucks from the big car companies. And he was basically saying you guys, you know, the trains leaving the station now, if you need guys need to get on board this clean technology thing. But he came around and looked at our car, he didn't see it once before. And this time kind of says out loud the reporters are standing. I said, this car rocks, he says. Then right about this moment when this picture was taken and the reason had this funny look on my face, he says, I'm buying one for Maria for her birthday. So yeah, he bought one. Yeah. January we opened our factory in Taiwan to build our motors. Our motor is a classic AC induction motor. U-electrical engineers know what that is. It was actually invented by Nikola Tesla, hence the name of the company. But our motor is a very, very high power motor for this island. It's about this big, about that long. You can pick it up. It's 250 horsepower. And the reason for that is that the rotor on the thing is not made of aluminum but copper. And the difficulty of building a motor out of copper is assembly process. So our technology in the motor is how you put that rotor together. That's where our patents are. And that's the reason why our first factory is actually making a motor because we saw no upside in teaching somebody else how to build our motor. We also opened our Michigan Technology Center, allowing us to begin hiring American automotive engineering talent. We now have about 30, 40 people in Michigan. And despite the fact that they all came from Ford and General Motors and the rest, they're a far better crew than what you'll find at Ford and General Motors. Just the process of selecting and coming, dumping your pencil, leaving on your desk at General Motors and walking out and coming to a little startup company, selects the best people somehow. And I guess the lesson I've learned throughout this is, is hire the best people. And a correlate to that is when it's time for somebody to go get them out of there. I'm always as a manager. I'm reluctant to let people go when it's obviously should go. And by the time I do let somebody go, when they're out the door, the whole company's like, well, you should have done that six months ago. But you need to balance the team with the combination of smarts and experience. And of course, the passion and enthusiasm for what you're doing. So we took advantage of the winter of 07 to do Arctic Circle Testing. Some of you might have seen a few of these videos before. I'll show you something maybe that you haven't. This is taken in this unpranceable town up in Sweden. It's actually not in the town. It's on a lake outside of town. So frozen lake with snow on it, quite slippery. It's minus 30 degrees a sun that's only above the horizon four hours a day. Our engineers were highly motivated to get the car working. And the main thing was to get the traction control and the anti-lock brakes working correctly. So this is sort of an early picture. Very good driver, a bit of a flail. But there were some questions to whether these cars would work at all when it was that cold. And the answers they ran fine. Now by the end of the week, we had the traction control working great. This is just about impossible to drive on the surface. Watch this guy come around the corner. By the way, this is noon. Watch how high the sun is when he comes around the bend here. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And he's a remarkably good driver just pulling that off. Our first several drives actually don't have videotapes. The very first ones where we just drove it straight into a snow drift. This next test is a split new test. This is the anti-lock brake testing. The left wheels are on pavement, the right are on ice, and the trick is to stop straight. The interesting thing about this whole series of tests is that our anti-lock brakes supplier was a company that works with lots of other companies. What they're used to doing is coming out to the ice, driving the car for a couple of days, modeling on the computer, saying, OK, we need the torque of your engine to do this under this circumstance. And the engineers from the car come and say, OK, and they go back to Stuttgart or wherever. And they work on it for a while, and then three, four, five weeks later, they come back and try again. And over the course of several months, they get the anti-lock brakes tuned in. In our case, because we have absolute microproster control of the directly of the torque of the motor, when they say that we want the torque to do this under the circumstance, our engineers went tap, tap, tap on the laptop computer, and five minutes later, the car was on the ice again. And we went from a complete flail to anti-lock brakes in perfect shape in one week flat. They'd never seen it before. They're blown away. So, come February, we got our first of our new transmission parts coming in for the new supplier. It's kind of late, it's already coming on. And we've got the tools being built for production. This particular tool is molding the bumper. Just give you an idea of the industrial scale of stuff that goes on. These are all at suppliers. We own the tool, but the press is owned by the supplier. And we began building what we call the validation prototypes. The validation phases were you basically take all the lessons you learned through the engineering prototype phase, and build those into a car and hard to the whole thing. So the body panels, everything are off of production tools. Started that in February, and finished the first card march and shipped it to California. And about this time, we're ready for the scariest of all the tests. There's a test for gasoline powered cars that's called FNVSS302, whatever that is. And FNVSS302, oh, the lights are going up and down here, so I just want to... FNVSS302 is a new law that came into place after a couple of very high profile accents on the highway, where a higher patrol officer was on the side of the road, and a truck or something zeroed in on the tail, I simply plowed it back to the car at full speed, and the car spewed gasoline over the roadway and killed everybody. So the requirement on this is actually on the 302, is a gasoline powered car has to take a 50-mile-hour rear end collision, and then the turn it upside down is not allowed to dump more than a... maybe a pint or something of gasoline, that's it. 305 is an electric car equivalent. You take a 50-mile-hour rear end collision, and afterwards turn the car upside down, see if anything leaks out. There's nothing to leak in our car. And then they check for any kind of electrical danger in the car. So what's happening right here is this car is parked here, these guys are listening to radio, no idea what's happening. This thing back here is a truck, it's going 50 miles an hour, it's just a moment before impact. This is a very violent crash, and I want to remind those people who aren't engineers here. The energy of a collision goes up as a square of the speed. So this is a lot of energy, you're going to see something. This is a kind of video that the car comes, don't only show, because it takes a bit of explained, understand what's going on, but here we go. All right you guys, nice radio listening along, here we go. Oops. Okay, so it eats the back of the car completely, but pass yourself a amazing tag, this specially constructed truck gets airborne. It's actually all four wheels in the air, crushing down on the car, and you think how the hell can anything survive that? And when it's all over, we cut the car apart in the back, check all the broken stuff off, you can see the transmission is split in half right here, all the structure is broken, this black box here is a battery box. It has just a scratch on it, it's actually still functional world done. It's amazing, and the G-forces on the crash system is what we're going to expect to. So it was a success the first time, and that was a testament to the computer modeling. Somewhere when one of the Sandhill Road venture capitals was doing due diligence upon us, they brought in a bunch of folks from Detroit, and one of the guys that had been out of Detroit out of the car comments for a while, it says, well, how do you think you can get away with, 10 or 15 car crashes? We have to do 50 or 100 at whatever company he came from. And another one of the Detroit guys is how you've been out of this is too long guy, computer models are much better, even at GM, we only crash about 10, 12 cars. The models are good enough now. By April, with success of the crash testing, with the validation prototypes going, and so forth, we disclosed our most recent round of fundraising. And I guess my lesson here is, it's hard to read these colors, sorry about that, is to aggressively follow all leads. This is something that maybe marking folks take naturally, but as an engineer, the idea of just calling up a whole bunch of people and having them tell me, no, over and over again, is depressing, I don't like to do that. And that's true mostly for money, but also for hiring good people, and in this business for suppliers and so on. And my advice to anybody doing is, is just just get over it and call people continuously. I mean, take Elon, for example, the guy that was the guy that put the most of the money in the series A round and followed in almost every other round. I met him here at Stanford once, he gave a talk at some lecture series I was at, long before I started this company, and I thought he was an interesting guy, and I shook his hand then that was it. And then some years later, I heard that just to the grapevine that he had some interest in electric cars, so I just called him and said, hey, Elon, maybe don't remember me, but I'm gonna come by your office and give you a pitch. He said, I'll have to come up by. And this was after being, haven't been told no by probably 30, 40 people before him. And he listened to my talk, and two hours later, I had a hand check agreement for that round of fundraising. So it's just a way to, may our Thailand factory was up and running buildings, the battery packs, and the motor factory was up and running building motors. And we began shipping motors from Taiwan factory to the UK factory to put them in a car. So crazy supply chain, that's what we have. And somewhere on the way we discovered that we actually couldn't ship batteries, the United Nations had a rule about shipping stored energy, and our battery pack was big enough that we needed DOT approval, and also, you end approval to just to put in a container, to put it on a ship even. And that required demonstrating through a very intense program of drop testing, and poke testing, and crash testing, and so on, these things were safe under all circumstances. And our battery pack is so big that their actual test procedures didn't even really work for us, so we had to help them develop the test procedures even. Well, just fairly recently, we actually hit a home run. The home run is that we got not only approval to ship these things, but we got permission to put them on airplanes. And that's amazing, because right now, it's a 35 kilogram limit for Lutti-Mai and Battery Pack on an airplane, and trust me, ours weighs a heck of a lot more than 35 kilograms. So this was a home run. We actually don't plan to ship many by air, but this showed that they were that satisfied with our demonstration of the safety of the thing, and their own testing of it. So we started shipping them at that point. These are complete battery packs on pallets on the way to the factory. And just recently, we finished our 10th validation prototype. This is the one owned by marketing that's been here and there lately. And then we were ready for side impact testing. This is actually, too bad the video's not very good. There's a little spot right here, there's a little thing fluttering in the air. That's the tail of the marker light from the corner. It actually came off the car and just didn't move. It just hovered in space while the truck in the car and everything went beyond it. But this is a very difficult crash because you have no room to absorb the energy of the crash. This is on the bottom. This is looking through the glass floor and you can see the truck hitting it and the frame holding up quite well. Again, we passed these first time. And that was the last of the series of the crash testing on the first round of cars. And we're beginning to start testing the second set of cars now, just basically proving that everything you did works. As we move into the RID phase into sort of operating buying parts, making cars and selling them, we brought in a new CEO and I don't get to be CEO anymore with the new president of technology, which is actually a lot more fun. And Michael Marx is taking over that role. We did just announce that we are slipping the schedule of the car because of the transmission program. It's been driving us all along. I remember that face reality thing. If we had faced it three months earlier, we wouldn't have had this perhaps. But the good news is we just did our EPA testing. This is our car sitting on a dynamometer with an EPA representative there running the test and validating that we actually can drive this car 245 miles on a charge, which is probably triple, certainly more than double what any other electric car that's been sold could ever do. We also actually measured our zero to 60 time. We can do a 3.86 seconds and that's startling fast. And that number doesn't tell the whole story because if you get into just about any other car that can do four seconds zero to 60, you're talking about a car where you've got to put the clutch in, rather than the thing to red line, let the clutch out in a way that's going to burn clutch. And then probably around 40 miles an hour, you need to do a very high speed shift into second gear. This is the kind of thing the skilled driver might be able to pull off about half the time. Whereas this one, my wife can do zero to 60 and four seconds on that car. And she's not the led fault that I am, trust me. It's a, you know, you point the car straight and you put the pedal down and it does the right thing. And that's because the way that these motors work, they produce full torque at zero RPM. When you stop, the motor stops, you step on it and the motor just does what it's supposed to do. The red line on our motor is 13,000 RPM. So it's like a motorcycle. So we don't even shift gears until way past 60 miles an hour. So we're delivering what we set out to do. The reason that we set out to make a sports car, I mean, we're really in extreme sports cars, our first model car, aside from the fact that I wanted one, was that I felt it to get into any market at the low end, like everybody's ever tried with electric cars before, was crazy. When you think about other products, flat screen TVs, our cell phones, our refrigerators, or whatever, when these things get invented, they start at the high end of the market. And as we learn how to build a product as the supply chains mature and everything else, we can bring the product, price down, and reach a large, larger larger audience. That was one point. But the other point was that if you think back four years ago, the way that people thought about electric cars, there were two things everybody knew about electric cars. One, they sucked. And two, they were dead, right? That was everybody knew that. And we had to change that perception. We had to change it fundamentally. So we couldn't make a car that was a little bubble car that could get you around the town. We had to make a car that completely, totally went against the perceptions that were out there. I think we've done that. I think that today, most people don't actually think, either of those two things about electric cars. They're still waiting for us to deliver. But I think the idea out there that you can make an electric car, nice, it's real now. I was last year at the Detroit Auto Show, was hanging out with Bob Lutz over at General Motors. And he admitted to me that they started a Chevy Volt program at GM as a direct response to the Tesla Roadster. So I had an impact in there also, which, from my global thing I'm trying to do here, was a big success. So we've got some work to do left this year, mainly transmission work and a whole bunch of other stuff. We can't do the last of the crash tests until we have the final version of the transmission. You remember that rare inclination I showed you? Transpiration is definitely involved. So we have to wait till that's done. And begin shipping next year and begin focusing on our next car. So just a summary of my ideas or the lessons, some of the lessons I guess have learned or I'm trying to learn, are these do something meaningful? Be bold. Think your ideas through. Build your company while you're building your product. Face reality every day. Hire the very best people and aggressively follow all leads. That's what I have to say. Thanks. APPLAUSE So now you get to ask me this question. We have microphones here. And here, where's your hand? What's your phone? See, do you want, do you folks are videotaping? Do you want the people asking questions to find a way to the mic or can they just shout out the questions? OK. OK, so hold on to the mic round. So because they're videotaping, I can't just ask the question. Sorry. How do you think about baby for this car or on a white car, a second car about doing mess manufacturing, mess distribution? Are you thinking about partnering with other big companies or are you trying to do everything yourself? So in terms of manufacturing, we are easing our way into being a full-fledged manufacturer of cars. With the roadster, we make a few bits and pieces of it. We don't make very much. We've been possible for us to build a real factory. For the next car, we probably will build a factory probably in New Mexico to do final assembly, but we'll bring in the major subassemblies from suppliers around the world. The next car, we might do a bit more. It's inevitable that we do some kind of partnership with other car companies, even today we are, with Lotus and with other suppliers, because we simply can't make all the parts on the car. And that's just not based on any kind of philosophy, but it's the only way you can do the business. It'll be certainly buying from the tier one suppliers that sell the other car companies. And perhaps working directly with one of the bigger car companies, and yet building our own cars and our own factory. Other questions? Hi. Can you right here? Where? Right here. Hi there. Hi. Can you make Teslas without using too much energy? Can you make the car without using too much energy? It sort of depends on what too much means. But can you keep energy efficiency in mind in the manufacturing process? So with the roadster, we bought into somebody else's process already. We're using Lotus as process. And they're pretty good. It's a fairly manual process. So we use a lot of human energy on that car. And we don't have a lot of leverage to invent new processes yet. But as we grow forward, as we look at our, at building our plant in New Mexico, that will be a lead certified plant. And we will be working to be efficiently where we can. We have to be realistic about it. So there's a balance there. If you come around and look around our offices today, no, we're not perfect. We don't do a perfect job of recycling. We're not really good about everything we do. But we try. And as we grow up, we'll be better at it. This is the company can get better as we get to be a bigger company. Hi. Hi. I'm up here. Where? Over here. When you say over here, I hear you on the speakers. Hi. Great job. It's about time. Is there a heater and air conditioning and how they work? Yes, there's a heater and an air conditioning. The heater is just the old-fashioned way. It's a resistor. It's a P-A-O heater that heats the cabin. And the air conditioning is a traditional air conditioner using a relatively clean coolant. It's not dull, fashion-free on. But it's electrically driven compressor, because we don't have a belt drive off the engine. The air conditioner serves a secondary role in the car. And that is that if it gets hot enough, it's also used to chill the liquid that cools the battery. So it's an interval part of the drive train as well. We thought about using a heat pump for heating. And the reason we didn't do that is to slow. It takes too long to get up the heat. Up here. Is this on? I was wondering how long it takes to charge the battery. If you see this charge time as a barrier to entry and what you're going to do to either combat that or change public perception. Yep. So obviously, the charge capacity of electric cars has been the killer's heel electric cars for the last 100 years, no matter what anybody else might say about it. And the first thing that we've done to address our problem is put the biggest battery with the best technology we could in the car. The charge time of the car, let me give you some math. And those of you who can do the math, it's a 56 kilowatt hour pack. It can charge at 240 volts, maximum of 70 amps. If you do the math, that means empty to full. That's about a three and a half hour charge time. If you don't have a 70 amp circuit, if you plug them to your mom's dryer, I love that's about 30 amps. So that's going to be what it was at eight hours is something charge time. So the limitation to charging electric car actually isn't the car. It's not our batteries. It's not the charge circuitry. It's how big of a wire can you bring out your house? I mean, a 70 amp circuit is already, it's asking a lot of the electrical system you have to charge that. If you want to charge a car in five minutes, I can't do the math in my head. But the wires would be like this. And you need to gang your house in your neighbor's house and all up and down the street to do that. So you can't do it. So I think in the long run, the answer isn't that. The long run isn't to try to charge quickly, but to put enough capacity in the battery pack that it becomes like your cell phone. Most of us don't charge our cell phone anymore during the day. You just go home and plug it in. And in the morning, I'm plug it and use it all day long. And I think cars will be like that when the range is enough. 240 from five miles in the way I drive called maybe 190 miles, because I don't get the most efficiency the way I drive. But that's enough for me to make it all with you my day for normal daily driving, no matter how nutty I might be. It isn't the road trip car yet. I think that the road trip car you need five or six hundred miles. But here's the thing. This technology of battery, this classic battery has been getting better, getting higher capacity at a rate of 8% per year for the last 20 years, 8% per year. So 10 years from now, I can build a battery pack with double-litre capacity. That's a 500 mile car. And that starts to say, I don't stop. I don't charge ever except for I sleep, which means it's at home or at a hotel. So first of all, it's very admirable to hold projects. And knowing that there's a competitor in Italy, and there's $245,000, $100,000 is a bargain. So the question is, and I think you'll have a bigger impact than you come out with a four door, which you're actually being able to remass markets. 65 grand, I think it was a price degree, as we were shooting for. Anyways, the question that I have was, will you ever be pressured by lobbyists? Because it's got a global impact in terms of all consumption. So will you ever sell out for $10 million to the company and just put it down, shut it down? Or? It's too late now. I mean, just imagine tomorrow, GM comes, I'm with a big ol' bag of money and buys my company, and we all go home and they close it all down. I mean, they are already suffering so badly from having shut down the EV1. They can't anymore. They're cats out of the bag. But our goal is not sell the company. Our goal is to make a real car company out of it. And it's going to be hard, and it's going to take time. And it's going to be a long time before we can make any significant number of cars compared to the millions of cars that get sold worldwide. But it's the only way I know how to get there. Where are we? Yeah, right over here. I had research and development, I guess you do, on Barry Power. And what do you think about the recent patent that was filed for the super capacitor of UXCOT? And are you interested in that? So if you go back and look at the history of electric cars for the last 100 years, for the last 100 years, there's been a magic new battery technology right around the corner any day now. And almost all of those actually never happen. They remind me of bubble memory or something. They just don't happen. Every now and then something does come around. The nickel-middle hydride batteries were one. Lithium ion was the next. Our philosophy is not to try to invent new battery chemistry in our cells. But rather to let the industry do that and use the very best commodity cells are on the market at any given time. Today, the lithium formula batteries are the best. There's a bunch of different kinds. Lithium ion, lithium cobalt like we use. There's lithium manganese, there's lithium iron phosphate and some others. And each of these are better in different kinds of applications. Every time we design a car, we're going to look and see what is out in the market. In fact, we have our feelers into almost every battery company around the world to know where they're going in the labs. When we make our decision for the next car, it'll be based on the best batteries that are actually in production, mass production now. We're enthusiastic that everybody's doing this research. And we love the fact that everybody in San Hill Road now is investing in energy storage technology. It's a great thing. And hopefully that will generate better batteries for our solar future. But we have no religion about supercapacitors or lithium batteries or nickel batteries or whatever. Yeah. Your current roadster is unmistakably laced with the lotus design. It's obvious that lotus has an imprint on it. And how do you go forward differentiate yourself as a brand? So that's a very good question. And if you look at my early, early business plan, actually before 1.0, long before I just dared to show it to anybody, I thought we could actually use a large amount of the lotus body panels. And it became clear to me that if we did that, we would be nothing more than those guys to make the electric the lease. And so we bit the bullet into the entire new body design. The only thing on that car that actually is common to a lotus that you can see is the windscreen and the side mirrors. And even that, it's amazing how much that windscreen makes you see the elicitor even though there's no other body panels that are even remotely similar. But we were lucky to that because the reason we needed to work with something like lotus on that car was we knew we did not have the wherewithal to develop the basic safety systems of the cars ourselves in scratch. We had to start with something that existed. Our next car was started from scratch. We've hired a absolutely world-class stylist to do the design of that car. And he's not starting with trying to wrap around somebody else's guts. Yeah. Are you looking at any other alternative energies to enhance your battery packs, like solar energy, or your fuel cells on the road? Absolutely. I'm doing it myself right now. I'm putting 5 kilowatt's and solar panels on the roof of my house. People have asked, can we put solar panels on the car? And I say that's a little bit like fins on a Cadillac. The decorative looks nice, but doesn't do very much. The amount of energy that hits the roof your car will be driving along just isn't enough to make a big difference. If we got pretty good solar panels and covered the whole top surface, it might increase your driving range by 10 miles, it's not worth it. It's far, far better to leave the panels at home where they can be at the perfect angle and they can store that energy in the perfect storage system called the grid. And then you can pull it back off again at night and charge up. I think that on board not so. Now, the fuel cell thing, I'm actually a huge, what's the word? What's the opposite of a proponent? I think that most of the talk about fuel cells and cars is a long discussion we can have some other time. But I do think that the idea of a plug-in hybrid where you can use plug-in electricity for some amount of your driving and some other fuel source, whether it's gas and or diesel, or whatever, for those long trips, is not a bad idea in the interim. I think that's a good idea for next 10 years, let's say. So no worries, I think the Chevy Volt's not a bad idea. Yeah. All right here. Hey. Oh, there's been. Sorry. Me. Hello, where are you? I'm there. Oh, sorry. I saw the other mic. It's still me. There's been some talk recently of exploding batteries. And I'm wondering, I know from the crash tests, it seems your battery packs have been just a little scratching them. But it seems to me that one explosion and one car turns the Tesla into an exploding Pinto. So you're absolutely right. And gasoline also explodes pretty well, too. And as I've demonstrated a few times. But we've learned over the years how to make our cars not be Pinto's or those Chevy trucks. We've learned how to make the gasoline system safe in a car. And that's the same thing with Tesla. I'll tell you a bit of a story about that. When we started getting the data sheets from the cell manufacturers of made these batteries, they painted a very rosy safety picture. They talked about being able to take a crushing and a piercing overvoltage and this and the other thing. And nothing really bad ever happened. And some of our engineers got more and more suspicious about that. And eventually we said, let's see what happens if. So we took a cell and wrapped it up with a micron wire and sort of put some heat into the thing. And some of them were hit about 190 degrees C. Let me see. There's a word that they use in the rocket industry and expression, an RUD. You might not know that. That's a rapid unscheduled disassembly. We devastated an RUD with that cell. And after our guys went up on the roof of the building and put the pieces back down again, we decided that this was serious. And we stopped the program, the entire program, and made it a requirement that our battery system had to survive a cell catching on fire for whatever reason. So I mean, later on the Sony had to let us go. We were smiling because we've seen that already. We assumed that a cell in our battery pack will catch fire dramatically. And the package designed to absorb the energy of a rapidly disassembling cell in a way that the neighboring cells don't catch fire. So to give you some numbers, Sony has made about 8 billion lithium ion cells so far. And of those, it used to be brighter in here. And of those, they've had eight out-of-the-field actually catch fire in an ugly way. That's a 1.1 billion kind of problem. Divide by 10,000 for how many we have in the car. That's numbers that if it means that your car coast is side of the road, we have to get a tow truck. That's one thing. But if the car burns up, then you've got a disaster. So we've designed the system so that should one of those cells catch fire, what the driver would experience as a check engine light in their car would coast to the side of the road. And it can be repaired. But nothing bad will happen from that. And then we've tested it over and over and over again. There's a company around here called Exponent. It's called failure analysis associates. That turns out their experts in two things is really handy. Their experts in car crashes. They do the safety testing. We didn't use them. But they're one of the companies that does that kind of crash testing. And they are the most likely company to be called when somebody's lithium ion battery laptop catches them fire. They're the ones that come in and do the post-mortem and figure out what the hell went wrong. So we hired them and worked with them very closely to first understand all the safety issues of these batteries and then to validate their design by actually setting a lot of battery packs on fire. Other questions? What is your plan for distribution? And have you considered licensing your technology to other companies? OK, so I'm going to be a little bit, I'm going to tread carefully here on the distribution side. Anybody in this room here is like a car dealer? Are you dad? Here's the thing. The way that cars are sold today are sold through franchises. And in every single state in the country, the automotive franchises are protected by very special class of laws. Here in California, there are automotive franchise laws that apply just to car dealers and nobody else. These were created a long time ago when the only way that Ford or John Motors could sell a car is that guy in a plaid suit that would sell it to your mom or your grandma or whatever. And that was a deal that they cut with the devil. They basically gave away the right to sell the cars forever. The way the laws work, if we ever sell a franchise to anybody, it's all over. You can never take it back. If you own a Ford dealership, you Ford cannot come in to your territory, predefined territory, ever and put another dealership in. Your children have the legal right to inherit that dealership in perpetuity. They can never take it back. They can't buy you out. They can't make overtures to buy you out. They can't mess with your financing. Nothing they can do. About the only way that they can get your dealership back from you is if you commit some felony, then they can come in and take it back. So I didn't understand this. And I got in that homologation phase. I got to read those rules. And I just did it. I don't think I want to do that. So we've decided to sell the cars directly to our customers. And we're opening the stores gradually, slowly as we can afford to around the country, that are that sell the cars and service them. We were setting up a service network to bring our own parts in there. And it's difficult and expensive, but I think it's cheaper and easier than selling into an existing franchise. It's not pretty, but it's what we have to do. So you showed us that the car can really pick up speed really quickly just by pressing the accelerator. And that's, I think, great for technology and for sports cars. But for the average person, I think that's safety concern. Is there anything you've done about that? The car also stops very quickly, first of all. We put very good brakes on it. And it's got very serious sports car suspension. This is one of the joys of working with Lotus. So those guys make the best handling cars on the planet. So the car handles like a dream, stops well, and has tracking control on the kind of safety features we can put into it. If you want to get into a car and wrap around a tree, you can with pretty much any car. And this car will do that for you. We do, right now we offer a software mode on the car that we call valet mode. If you, how many of you guys saw Ferris Beelor's Day off? That will be changed my opinion about valet. And so we have valet mode that you hit a button on the screen. And it limits the torque limits of speed, it limits the range you can drive for the car. You can set it, but you can say, OK, you can drive two miles. You're not going to go more than 30 miles an hour, and you're 0 to 60's can be forget it. We're talking with the idea of having a teenager mode on the car, too, for the same reason. I haven't done it yet, but one could. I think that there isn't trade off on cars. Cars are unlike most of the products that we make. The cars are in fact dangerous. And you have to get over that. This is something that we face every day. That one day, somebody is going to get killed in one of our cars. And we're going to have that day look in the mirror and say, did we do what we could to make that car safe? Because it's going to happen, for sure. Great. Thank you very much. I'm going to have to say it.
