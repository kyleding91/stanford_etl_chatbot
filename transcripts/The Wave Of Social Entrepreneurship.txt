 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader's series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. I am delighted to introduce our guest today. Jeff's Church is an advocate for social responsibility and for stateability around the world. He has a long history of founding many companies, but his most recent venture is a social venture called Nika Water that he co-founded three years ago. And he's going to share some insights today with us on the coming wave of social entrepreneurship. Jeff. Thank you, Tina. Thank you. Hello, everyone. How are you doing? Great. Awesome. Awesome. I want to start with taking you back to my senior year in high school. It's a long time ago. I was playing in a football game. It was the seventh game of my senior year. We had lost every single game in my junior year, and we lost the first six games in my senior year. And I was a very mediocre football player on a really lousy team. And it was late in the game. In this particular game, I actually had a pretty good game. I had caught a touchdown pass, and I had caught a couple other passes. So I was having a pretty good game, and we were actually within kind of striking distance of potentially winning the game. And as we were on the opponent's 10 yard line, and as the quarterback rolled out, I was in the end zone. And I happened to be open, but the quarterback didn't see me. And I had to, in a split second to side, should I raise my hand and let the quarterback know that I was open, or should I, and thereby take the chance that he throws me the ball, and I drop the ball and become the goat? Or should I not raise my hand and let the quarterback have his chances if he gets in the end zone? And my decision, it felt like an eternity in that split second of my calculus. And I ended up making a decision that's kind of haunted me, but then formatively changed me for years. I made the decision not to raise my hand. And the quarterback didn't see me, he ended up getting tackled, and we ended up losing. And I struggled with that so much afterwards. And what really was the reality of it was, I was more afraid of failing. Then I was afraid of being mediocre at that time in my life. I didn't have enough confidence in myself to really step out there and appreciate what I really could do. It was only later that I learned that I had more fear about being mediocre than I did about failing, which is ultimately what pushed me over the entrepreneurial cliff, if you will. The second one that I want to mention is failing at my, getting my life card certificate when I was 16. And I thought I studied, I thought I did the practical exam, I thought I did all that. But I failed miserably on both. I failed on the practical exam and I failed on the test. And for years, again, I agonized over how could I fail a life-guarding test? How could I do something to fail something like that? But when I realized what it did for me, it was one of those formative moments that it taught me the rest of my life that I better out-prepare everything. So today, I'm not necessarily the sharpest guy in the room, but I will outwork anyone in the room. And I learned that kind of the secret to a successful 40-hour work week is to work 80. And that's just how I can do it. I also learned the value of networking. I got a pretty good job out of graduate school because I want to a pretty good graduate school, because I had a pretty good job before that. I got a pretty good job before that because I got a pretty good internship. I got a pretty good internship because I was involved in the accounting society at my school and I hosted the different firms to come into town to meet with the students. And as they were coming in to meet with the students, I realized that, hey, I can network with these people and I can maybe do something good for myself. And I did that and it kind of helped. And the value of networking is just so important, particularly at a younger age. I'll give you one other example of the value of networking. How many of you heard of the economist Jeffrey Sachs? So most people have heard of him. You're far ahead of me. I didn't know who he was five years ago. But as I started on my quest to learn about poverty alleviation and extreme poverty, I kept stumbling across his name when I was googling around and doing web surfing. And one night I decided, you know, one night I found his email on one of the blogs I was reading. And I thought, what the heck? I'm going to email this guy. He'll probably never respond, but I'm going to try. So I emailed him at 11 o'clock at night, got back though the next morning at 7 a.m. There was an email from Jeffrey Sachs. And it said, hey Jeff, nice to meet you. If you can call me at 1010, call me and I love to talk with you. So I decided between 7 and 10, I better research who he was. And thankfully I hadn't done it the night before. I probably never would have emailed him. And I got on the phone with him at 1010 that morning. And we had a nice 20 minute conversation, invited me to New York to meet with him. And he said, I'm sorry Jeff, I got to go. I've got the president of Malawi in my office. And I thought, geez, I really felt awestruck. And my point is, you may call that email stalking, but I do it all the time. I do it with LinkedIn, I do it with email. I probably email 10 people a week that I don't know. And probably nine of them don't respond. But the one that responds tends to sometimes open a door. And sometimes we don't want to do that, but I would really encourage you to kind of push yourself out of your comfort zone and try doing that kind of thing. I wanted to give you a little bit of my experience. I think it's relevant in talking about commercial entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship. I spent four years in public accounting at Ernst & Young, where I really learned what a CPA really means. It means cut, paste, and attach. And that was about the extent of my, I knew I didn't want to be an accountant forever, but I felt like it was a great language of business to really learn. And then I spent 12 years involved in a middle market kind of no name company. And sometimes I think we get our brains, we want to go work for the big consulting firm or the big investment bank or the big brand or whatever. And in reality, sometimes the middle market type companies, you can get really great experience just by working in a middle market business. This was about a three or four hundred million dollar business. And I was able to move around, I think I moved 10 times in 10 years. And I was able to move around and get lots of different general management experience. And it was really a great experience for me. But towards the end of my late 30s, I began to really think, I want to go off on my own. And I want to take that entrepreneurial plunge. I want to do that. My wife, who is a Mediterranean and first generation American, has the risk tolerance of Richard Branson. So she's always pushing, pushing, pushing to kind of do that. But I grew up kind of Midwesternish and I had a very risk of, you know, somewhat risk of a profile. But I knew I kind of wanted to do that. I knew I wanted to do that. And I felt like I was standing on a high board blindfolded, wondering if there was water in the pool beneath me. Knowing that I want to take that plunge, but I just can't quite take that plunge in it because I wasn't sure if there was water in the pool. And then to make matters worse, my mom piled on and she wanted me to do it. And then when your mom wants you to do something, you know it maybe it's a bad idea, right? Because I remember when I played high school football, we lost the game 42 to nothing. And I had a horrible game and I came into the house and she said, well, I thought you played good, honey. So I just wasn't quite there. But you know, one night I was channel surfing late and I came across an interview and it was an interview where it was going around. He was interviewing about 10 people. It's senior citizens. And he was asking them, what did they wish they had done differently in their careers? And every single one of those people said they wish they had taken more business risk. They wish they'd kind of put it out there a little bit further. And the last thing you want to do is get to that stage in your life and feel like, geez, if only I had kind of taken that shot. You know, I'd much rather take the shot and be able to look back and say, hey, I took the shot. It didn't work, but I took the shot. I gave it everything I got. And I realized at that time that I had switched my paradigm from that high school football example of being more afraid of failing. Now I was more afraid of being mediocre than I was of failing. So I worked out a deal with my employer to leave and I spent three months basically working with them on a transition plan. I was running a couple hundred million dollar business and I worked out a deal with them and I felt really good about that deal. I was a tremendous amount of integrity in doing that. I would really encourage any of you to the extent you leave somewhere. You only have your good name in life to really leave as your legacy. And it ended up, as I left, after I left, I wanted to go find a company to buy and build. And there had been a company that we passed on in the company that I was at just before I left. And I was out looking for businesses and I remembered that company. So I went back to the CEO of the company and I said, hey, do you mind if I contact these guys, we passed on them previously. And they said, yeah, no problem. It didn't make sense for us in that particular situation. And that was the company I ended up buying. So really not burning bridges, really doing things right is really so important. I want to give you a little bit of synopsis on the six, I've done six deals, commercial for profit, traditional deals since I went off on my own. And I want to talk a little bit about the things that were common between the good ones and the things that were common between the bad ones. And I had, of the six, four were good, two were really good, not quite as good as instant gram, but they were pretty good. And two were horrific, kind of cratered on the rocks and bad news story. And a couple of the things that are important, the two bad ones, the economic cycle and the timing of the economic cycle, we're both right before a recession. So I bought one right in 1999 and I bought one in 2006. And it's really difficult. And the type that I would do, which were leveraged acquisitions, the type that I would do if the economy turns on you, you don't have a lot of room to maneuver. The second thing is gross margins. If you've got a 30% gross margin, you don't have a lot of room to kind of, Bob and weave if all of a sudden you hit a pothole. If you've got a 60 or 70% gross margin, you've got a lot more room to make a mistake and kind of whether that. You're also tying up a lot less cash and working capital and receivables and inventory. I also learned, you want to share the upside with people, but be really careful of the delusion. I know two people that started businesses and ended up selling them for each for over $100 million and they each ended up with only 5% of the company. Now you might say, and you're right, 5% of $100 million is a lot of money and it is, but there's no reason they shouldn't have had 30 or 40% of those companies. Now what tends to happen is if I'm starting a company and I want to have Johnny come work with me because I know he's got some skill set, it's really easy to say, hey Johnny, come work with me and I'll give you 10% of the company. And Johnny says, okay, I'll come work with you, 10% of the company. Well you kind of forget about that. Well Johnny doesn't forget about that, right? Whereas you could say to Johnny, hey Johnny come work with me. I'll let you share on the upside with me. I'll give you some options. It'll be great. We'll work it that way. And Johnny I'll be thrilled generally to come and work in that. So I really strongly believe in sharing the upside with those that perform and people that are with you, but I also don't believe in this giving it away. And it's really easy, particularly in startups, to be very easy about giving it away. I know people that have given it away actually and then those people didn't even stay with the company. So they left, but they still were vested in the equity that they had. Really understand your partners. The two companies that did not work, I knew in my gut. I just knew at the time I was buying them, deep down that these guys that I was buying their businesses from weren't great characters. They didn't have the integrity that I really needed to have. And when you're buying a business or building a business, integrity is just so important. The integrity of the people that you're working with and what you're seeing and what you're doing. I also believe very strongly in breaking bread with your prospective partner and taking your spouse or your partner or your friend with you and actually meeting with them and their spouse or their partner. There's a lot in a casual setting that can kind of come out and you can interpret things. And if you're a left brain person but your spouse is a right brain person, you'll see things very differently. And I think it's really important to be able to do that in order to really understand the partners that you're working with. We're not around about my early 40s. My wife and I began to think about transitioning from what was a more of a concentration and kind of business success to more of life significance. And we felt like we'd lived a significant life all along but we really wanted to move much more of our concentration over to that. So we began to kind of look around and I thought, do I want to do another deal? Do I want to, and at the end of the day, what are they going to put on my tombstone? Are they going to say, you know, he worked another deal, you know, he multiplied his money X, X, X bit more? No, hopefully not. Hopefully they're going to say, I was a good human being, I was a good parent, I was a good spouse, I made a different, I made a difference in the life of another. And we began to really think about, you know, how do we, you know, create a business where we can transition to that. And we started to study social enterprises and social entrepreneurship, which is what I really want to talk to you about today. And these products actually help save the world. Can something as basic as a bottle of Newman's own salad dressing actually bring joy to a child with a life threatening disease? Can a bottle of water sold here in the United States actually help bring clean water to someone in the developing world? Can a pair of Tom Shoes purchase it in Nordstroms? You know, actually put shoes on someone else's feet in South America. And can something as basic as a ream of office paper, not much more basic than that, right? And that actually provide a meal for a family of five for a week. And the answer is, yes, they can. And they're doing it through a, you know, really interesting model called social entrepreneurship. And I want to talk a little bit about what this model is. There's tremendous overlap between commercial entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship. They're very difficult to pull apart. You know, I do feel like that you can pull them a little bit apart by the mission of the business. Is the mission of the business to really, you know, fulfill a societal challenge, a societal solution, or is the mission of the business to, you know, create value and economic return and that kind of stuff for shareholders. And just as I say that, there's a bunch of, you know, counters that I would say against it. But they're very similar in terms of the implementation of them. And I feel like oftentimes social entrepreneurs screw up because they look at their business as, you know, nine parts cause one part business. And in fact, in the beginning, it's got to be nine parts business, one part cause. Because if the business doesn't stay around long enough because it can't make it, you can't do anything about the cause. So in the early days of a social entrepreneurship, a social enterprise, they're, it's all about making the business successful so that you can deliver whatever kind of give back model you've got. But on the, on the left, we've got the traditional for profit businesses. And you know, they give back tremendous amounts. I'm a large significant free market, you know, pro capitalism, you know, believer. And I believe these businesses give back tremendous amounts of money. But in the end, you know, ideally, I mean, in the end, legally, you know, they're really focused on creating economic return for their shareholders. And they can't be entirely focused on this other, this other model. On the right side, you've got the nonprofits. And you know, to be honest, they focused most of their time on fundraising. And the other person of their time, they spend on development. So they don't really have the time to create, you know, true businesses. And oftentimes, the NGOs aren't necessarily the best business people, you know, in the world. So in the middle here, in the bottom, you've got this hybrid model of social entrepreneurship, social enterprises. And the beauty of this is they can be anything. You know, they can be for profit businesses that are donating, in our case, 100% of its profits or they can be for profit businesses that are donating, you know, 2% or they can be, you know, donating a pair of shoes for every pair of shoes they sell. You know, they can be very different models. There's no right or wrong in that, in my mind anyway. You know, and on the other hand, you can have nonprofits that actually create sister companies. And those sister companies, you know, are for profit entities that maybe are helping lower their admin rate so they can attract more dollars. And I think it's a really exciting model because of that. So who are, you know, these change makers? We all know of the people, you know, like Gandhi and Mandela and Mother Teresa and they truly are larger than life people. But I believe that there's someone else in this room. I believe it's you who also can be a social entrepreneur and can really focus on this type of business. And I think you can find tremendous happiness, fulfillment and economic, you know, return by doing it. See, I believe that ordinary people, just like you and I, can do extraordinary things. And you know, you hear about the Mandela's and all those guys, but they all started out as ordinary people. They just kind of pushed one foot in front of the other and kind of jumped off that, you know, out of their comfort zone and made it happen. And one of the things I think, the more, you know, academic we get, the more intellectual we get, the more education we get, the more we learn all the reasons, you know, that businesses fail. And a lot of them do fail. But in fact, you know, you got to take that step. You know, what we should do is twist that paradigm and say instead of knowing all the reasons that they don't work, we should say, okay, now I know all the reasons that businesses do fail. Let me use those to make sure that my business doesn't fail. I think we have to twist that paradigm. I want to give you an example of two social entrepreneurs that have done incredible things. The first is a guy named Craig Kielberger. Has anybody ever heard of free the children organization? Not many people. It's an organization that Craig, when he was 12 years old, started. Craig was 12 year old kid living in Toronto. He was reading the Sunday paper. And he came across an article of another 12 year old boy who was murdered while protesting against child labor in Indonesia. And he said, Mom, Dad, you know, I got to go protest on Iqba's behalf. And his parents said, well, Craig, you know, kind of two problems. One, we don't have any money in two, you're only 12. And you know, he said, well, I'm going to raise the money. I'm going to find somebody to go with me. I'm going to make it happen. And he did. He did bake sales. He did all kinds of stuff to raise the money to be able to go to Indonesia. He went over to Indonesia, just so happened that the prime minister of Canada happened to be there at the same time. And he heard about this 12 year old Canadian that was there, the two of them connected. And the rest is kind of history. That was 17 years ago. Today he runs an organization that educates 50,000 people in the developing world every single day, just because he took that small step out of his comfort zone to make it happen. The second is an individual named David Perez. You won't have heard of him. You know, he's a friend of mine from San Diego. And when Katrina occurred, you know, David said he came to me a day or two into it and said, Jeff, you know, I'm really dissatisfied. Change is in happening fast enough. We're not getting medical supplies to the people that needed on the ground. And I said, oh, okay. I don't really know what you're going to do. He was a middle class guy, living in San Diego and didn't really have any money. And but he said, I'm going to figure it out. And I said, all right. And three days later, he showed back up on my doorstep. And it looked like he hadn't slept in three days. And in fact, he hadn't slept in three days. And he said, Jeff, I'm going in. And it sounded like a code word to me. Really wasn't sure what going in meant. You know, but he said, I'm going in. I'm going to make it happen. So he took a couple weeks off from his work. And he, you know, by the time it was over, he had been on the phone with Richard Branson. He had been on the phone with Michael Dell. He had been on the phone with Senators and Congressmen. He had been on the phone with people on the ground. He ended up raising enough money and getting in kind donations of people's airplanes to fly 72, 727s into New Orleans, carrying medical supplies. And he ended up taking a full load of people out of New Orleans to San Diego where he relocated them. All because he had enough hootspa. He just kind of put it out there. He had a roletex. He started calling people. He didn't get, he didn't get, he didn't get no as a bad word to him. And I believe that if people like this, and just like you guys, and just like me, we can all do this. I think we're at the beginning of a really powerful and really exciting wave of social entrepreneurship. And unlike a lot of things that are on the horizon that are kind of looming and they're, you know, they're kind of, they're not so good, they're dark clouds on the horizon, this is a really powerful positive thing. And it's a power positive, positive thing because you can really be part of this movement. And I think it's going to be a moon for a long period of time. And it has to do with five principal things. The first is you guys, young people. Young people today, you know, want to be part of something bigger than themselves and they also want to make a buck. And you can do both. You don't want to wait 30 years to, you know, to do that. And you don't have to wait 30 years to it. You can kind of get right at it. The second thing is the internet. The internet, you know, brings these global issues to our laptops, 20, 24, 7. They're coming right out. We can't turn them off. You know, you heard about, you've all heard of Coney 2012 pretty much on the invisible children. You know, I mean, that went viral. There are 80 million people watch that video in one week, you know, because of 17 to 29 year olds texting it, Facebooking it, you know, you know, tweeting it, kind of doing everything, you know, with it. And these issues, they're coming to us and now there's a vehicle to communicate and to inform that didn't exist before. The third thing is also the internet. The internet makes all of us be academic researchers from our laptop. There's no excuse whether it's a new business you're starting, a nonprofit, a for profit, whatever it is, there's no excuse for any of us not to be experts before we put a business plan together, before we talk to an investor, before we do anything like that, because we can get right, we can get incredible amounts of information right from our couch with our laptop. I'm looking at research and bringing a coffee product in from Haiti where we would bring it in, help the local people there donate the profits back to Haiti. And in the period of three days, I was able to talk with USAID people, I was able to get growing reports, I was able to, you know, communicate in ways that I would never have been able to do, you know, 20 years ago. The fourth thing is celebrities. Celebrities are increasingly using their platforms to pontificate for their causes and what's important to them. And when Bono gets up and talks about ending AIDS, you know, millions of people listen. And millions of people listen not only with their hearts, but they open their wallets and they listen that way too. And finally, the fifth thing is my generation, the baby boomers. As the baby boomers are retiring, a lot of them are giving back significant portions of their net worth. You probably heard about what Warren Buffett and Bill Gates are doing, with challenging the billionaire families to give back half of their net worth over their remainder of their lives. I think they're up to 70 families that have agreed to do that. And what's really amazing about that is when that money comes back in, you know, that money just doesn't come in and say, okay, do what you want with it guys. Now these are people that created value, created businesses. They want to hold people accountable. They want, when we look at projects that we want to do, you know, I look at P&L's of the projects. I force them to go through that discipline that, you know, governments just aren't really equipped to be able to do effectively. So I think this whole wave is a really powerful thing. But you might ask, is it really important? And I say heck yes, it's important. And the reason it's important is in part this graph. If you look at this is a 30 year graph of the pink line is the percentage of foreign aid as a percent of gross national product of Africa. And you can see it's rising, rising, rising. And then you can see per capita GDP dropping, dropping, dropping. And you know, they're not only not correlated. They're inversely, you know, correlated. And the point is, governments, it doesn't work when governments give money to other governments. There's corruption, there's issues, there's challenges to get in the way. It's got to be bottom up. It's got to be a hand up versus a hand out. That's really our model. It's got to be people like you and I, you know, getting on our social media and really making it happen, you know, that way. Five years ago, I had that privilege to have that individual Craig Kilberger from free of the children come to our home. And he talked to us about poverty alleviation. And he really, you know, our kids were four kids in high school and middle school. And they were really taken by it. And after he talked to our house, my children came to me and said, you know, mom, dad, we're going to Africa this summer. And I said, well, I don't know how you're going to Africa, you know, this summer. But if you're going, but in my wife and as a good Jewish mom said, if you're going, we're all going. So we all opt and went and we took 20 of us to Kenya and Ethiopia for a month. And we actually built water systems, helped build water systems, helped build schools. And it became a really transformative experience. And I wanted also my kids to understand the difference in relative poverty and absolute poverty. Relative poverty being, I must be poor. I can't afford the latest iPhone. And absolute poverty being, I live on less than a dollar a day. I walk 10K sometimes twice a day, oftentimes to get polluted water. We learned about the water crisis. The water crisis is that 4,500 people die every single day because of a lack of clean water. Everything is basic and basic as that. And that's the size of one large public high school evaporating every single day. And 90% of those people are kids under the age of 5. We learned that half the hospital beds in the developing world are occupied with people who are waterborne and are related diseases. And we learned about the poverty trap. And the poverty trap is that girls can't go to school in most areas because they have to get the water every day for the family. That's their job. And because they get the water every day for the family, they're not going to school. They tend to get married and pregnant at 13 and 14 years old. And then their children are born in the same poverty trap. And it's this vicious trap that they can't get out of. And oftentimes poverty alleviation, it's kind of like a ladder that's just one wrong out of reach. And all people need is just a little boost up to grab that bottom wrong to begin to climb their way out. And while we were there, my 14 year old daughter Nina at the time came to my wife and I and she had a bit of an epiphany and she said, Dad, we really want to do something about this. We'd like to start a business that can kind of help these people in some way. And we thought that was a really great idea. And she got together with our other kids and cousins that were with us and actually came up with the name Nika. Nika means to give in Zulu. And before we launched it, we began to think, I began to think about this quote that I really like a lot, which is, the destiny is not a matter of chance. It's a matter of choice. It's not a thing to be waited for. It's a thing to be achieved. And when destiny knocks on your door, you don't say, hold on a second, I got to comb my hair. You grab it by the throat, you wrestle it to the ground, you stomp all over it, you make it happen. Because you don't know when it's going to come back again. So as we got back to the United States, we began to create Nika. Nika is a bottled water brand in the United States that donates 100% of its profits to back to the developing countries. And as we got into it, we picked water. A lot of people go, ooh, I did pick bottled water. Does the world really need another bottled water company? And as we thought there was something very symbolic about providing clean water or selling water in the United States and providing clean water to others in the developing world. But people really struggle with the eco side of it. So we developed Nika with an eco policy that we believe is kind of best in place, kind of eco-wise for a plastic company. We use recycled plastic to make the product and we're certified carbon neutral with the product. And as we really got into this over the years, what we realized is that it's only costing $20 to bring clean water to someone for a lifetime. $20. I spent 12 at Starbucks the other day. I spent 35 at the movie theater the other day with my family. Now, it's not made to make us feel guilty, but that's made to make us feel like we can make these tough societal solutions. We can solve these issues without having to give up that other stuff. And we thought if we could be a $10 million revenue company, which would mean we'd generate about a million dollars after tax and profits, we could bring clean water to 50,000 people a year. And by doing that, that's kind of one thing and that's one thing that we're motivated on. But what I'm really motivated on is talking with people like yourself. And if a couple of you guys end up doing your own venture that has some kind of give-back component to it, whatever it is. And then if Tom Shoes is doing what it's doing, a Newman zone is doing what it's doing, and somebody else on the other side of the world is doing what they're doing. Now all of a sudden, you add all those up and you've got a sea change of businesses there in one way or another giving back. And when those businesses give back, you can move mountains with it. I have a short video that I'd like to show kind of going through the water crisis, but also as a startup entrepreneurial social venture, it's important to really kind of have some sizzle when you're a small company. You don't have a God's-Zillion dollars to invest in it. I wanted to chat briefly about another topic that's really near and dear to my heart. And I think that's something that's really evolving. It's called conscious consumerism. And I think that there's four forces that are really focused right now on making it so that we as consumers can really choose the products we want to enjoy. By choosing the right products, we can help and society's most challenging issues. And it has to do with four things. The first is the concept of social enterprises. I mean, you're seeing at universities all across the country, coursework being taught now on social entrepreneurship. You're seeing hybrid models where in the past, people would never invest money in a for-profit business that has a give back, a large give back model component to it. You're seeing lots of industry framework beginning to be created. On the right side, you've got the internet. When one in nine people on the planet have Facebook, it's a huge social media opportunity. When there's 200 million tweets a day and 500 million YouTube views a month, you've got this ability just like in the Coney 2012 for things to go viral right away and very quickly. At the bottom, you've got money. You've got the millennials that have $40 billion in discretionary purchasing ability. You've got moms that have become an incredible force not only in the mom blogging communities, but also in the household and controlling over 80% of the purchasing decisions. What do millennials and moms have in common? They really have in common that they're really much more cause oriented than 50-year-old men. Those people all of a sudden, they really want to support causes. On the left side, you've got the consumer. The consumer now, over last year, 40% of consumers said that they actually bought a product because of a cause related aspect to it. That's double what it was in 1993. They also have 80% of consumers saying they want businesses to be more cause oriented. They have over 80% of people saying they would actually buy a more expensive product or actually try a new product, which is even more challenging to get people to do if it was a cause based. All these forces really give us, I think, an obligation as consumers. Whatever we're buying, we should do a little homework on it. We should make sure that it's supporting the right cause. By God if they say they're cause oriented, dig a little deep on it to make sure that they're actually not charlatans that are just saying it to be commercial about it. Go on their websites. When you go on the NECA website and you drill down on where we've donated our money, I have contact information, I have emails, I have telephone numbers. I encourage people to communicate, to call these people and talk to them. Oftentimes I'll drill down on somebody's cause based page and it'll be a dead link. You kind of know there's a problem when it's a dead link, right? But even beyond that, if you're buying something, we as consumers have the ability to control what we buy, there's lots of good products out there. Choose one that's got a good cause to it. These give back brands. You've heard of some of these, I'm sure some of the little or companies on the top. And you probably are wondering why do you have Kruger on there? Why do you have Walmart on there? The reality of it is Kruger, large grocery chain, donates 12% of their pre-tax profits to charities. Walmart, for all the crap that they get, they donate $2.5 billion in product and cash each year. It's not just happening with these trendy entrepreneurial startup brands. It's also happening with these larger brands that are really doing it in a meaningful way. I wanted to leave you with some lessons learned. And these cut largely across all kinds of entrepreneurship, whether it's social or commercial whatever. And the first is begin with the end in mind. How many of you have read the book The Seven Habits by Stephen Covey? That's pretty good. So usually when I talk to college students, no one's ever heard of who Stephen Covey is. So I would really encourage you over the summer. Pick up a copy of that book, read it. It's a great, easy read. It's all practical, common sense. But it puts it in a really great framework. One of the concepts that he talks about is begin with the end in mind. Think about where you want to get to and then work backwards to where you are now and then develop your plan. And anytime I buy a business or build a business, I write the selling memorandum while I'm doing the due diligence to buy it. Why do I do that? Why do that? Because I want to see what holes I have in this business that I have to fill over the next three to five years while I'm building that company. So for example, if I write that plan and I notice that there's no intellectual property, well, and I want to create some sizzle when I sell it, I know I got to build in some intellectual property into that business. The second thing is be transparent with your donations. I mentioned that earlier about, you know, just you got to be fully authentic and transparent with it. The third thing is act boldly with your financial backing. It's kind of like applying to Stanford. You don't want to just give it your old high school try and say, ah, just whatever, whatever, you want to put your best foot forward, right? Or you're not going to get in. That doesn't mean don't tell the truth, but that means just kind of put it out there. People don't want a partner with somebody that the person is kind of a six out of ten. People don't want a partner with people like that. Find like-minded people. This relates more to the give back businesses. In the traditional commercial entrepreneurship, you can create options. You can do that kind of stuff. But if you're really a true give back business, you don't necessarily do that. So what you have to do is make people want to run through walls for you because they're inspired by the cause because they love what you're doing. When we first started Nika, I had a woman or someone come to me and say, you know, that so and so on their Facebook has that they were a co-founder of Nika and they'd come a month or two later. And this person was kind of upset about it. I said, hey, we just hit the lottery. That's great. I want everyone to feel like they're a co-founder of this because the more people that feel like this, the more they're going to want to run through walls to help us, you know, with our brand, to help us achieve our mission which is to end the worldwide, you know, water crisis. So you really want to make people feel like it's everyone's business. The product has to be good and it has to be price competitively. I know that Whole Foods upper management because I talk with them. They love Nika, you know, but when you get down into the trenches, if it doesn't have the inventory turns, if it doesn't have the profit margin for them, you know, those lower level people, frankly, their jobs are to, you know, maximize, you know, asset efficiency and to maximize profit. So they're going to ultimately not keep it on the shelf. Even if the CEO, you know, wants it. I mean, he may overwrite it for a little bit, but eventually, you know, it's not going to do that. So the product's got to have a good value proposition. I know a woman that has a maple syrup, you know, that, you know, it fits everything. It's awesome, except it tastes horrible. You know, well, how many times are you going to buy this maple syrup even once it's got a great cause and it's really helping, you know, her cause? You're not going to buy it that much. It's got to have a good value proposition. Out source as much as you can. Keep your costs variable. You know, human nature is, you know, if I make it all myself, I can, you know, make it for a lower cost because I'm not paying that profit margin to one of my suppliers. Well, the reality of it is if you're just starting something, first of all, you can't afford all the capital equipment or whatever you need to kind of get into that business, but those people that are suppliers, they're probably pretty darn good at it. Even though you're paying them a profit margin, you're probably getting even cheaper than you could have been doing it on your own. And the other thing is, is you start to get bigger and bigger customers as you're scaling your business. And if you're doing it all yourself, you're really not scalable if it's a product because they're not, you have to add more equipment. You have to add more capacity. But if you're outsourcing it, these people often, most of the time, have the capacity. So you can grow right with them. And it's a big, you know, it's a big opportunity with your customers. The eighth thing is learn on someone else's nickel. This doesn't mean screw up on someone else's nickel. But, you know, if you've got the next Instagram, I mean, go for it. I mean, I think that's, that's awesome. But, you know, in reality, it's great if you can kind of learn, you know, get your feet, make a lot of mistakes, you know, for a few years or for some period of time to really learn, you know, what you know, what you need to do when it's really on your own. I make, I probably make 20 mistakes a day. You know, I probably made 50 mistakes a day when I was younger. But my mistakes are less today than they were, you know, 25, 25 years ago. You're going to make mistakes. This doesn't mean puts your passion, you know, on hold. But this may, maybe it means just kind of percolate it for a while while you're, you know, while you're working and getting, and earning some money and creating some, you know, economics and that kind of thing. The ninth thing is oftentimes people quit, you know, when success is right around the corner. And I tell people, look, you know, unless it's systemically flawed, and it's very difficult to tell, but unless it's systemically flawed, keep pushing, keep persevering through it. You know, maybe you should ask your mentor, ask a parent, ask a business person, ask a CEO of another company to kind of check and balance you to make sure that, you know, it is, you know, you are on the right track. But kind of push through that, you know, threshold, you know, to persevere. Find a partner or mentor who balances you. You know, we all are going to be good at, you know, one or two things, but we're not going to be good at five or six things that cut across all functional areas. And most people tend to be more left brain or right brain. And I find it's really important to partner with somebody to compliment you. And this doesn't mean they have to be an equal owner. This doesn't mean they have to be an owner at all. They could be a parent, they could be a professor, they could be a, you know, a friend, they can be a CEO of another company, but partner with somebody else because the minute you go to talk to investors, you know, they're going to start drilling you. And if you're a sales and marketing person, you know, and they start drilling you on cash flow, you know, and you go, huh, huh? I mean, you know, you're done. It's over with that particular investor. So make sure you compliment yourself with somebody that really can pull that stuff out. And the final thing is what I call the rule of twos. And that's that everything takes twice as long and costs twice as much money. It's just human nature and that damn Excel. Excel makes everything really easy because we can make an Excel model like just really dynamite. And in reality, it's a lot harder to hit those models. And I find, you know, it just takes a lot longer, you know, than we think as human nature. So if you can, you know, run your models out for an extra, you know, two years. Run your cash flows out for, you know, double the double your costs. So that you really know the last thing you want to do is run out of money. And the last thing you want to do is run out of money when success is right around the corner because you're going to go out and raise money when you're out of money and talk about delusion. You're going to get wiped out, you know, and then you're going to be really unhappy. So, you know, make sure you get enough capital upfront so that you can kind of weather that storm. So with that, I'll turn it over to some questions. Great. Do you want to? Perfect. Yeah. The video mentioned that you can make under certain profits to those countries. So I wanted to ask that how does it work out for a social enterprise that is that wants to invest in its own business to grow to a certain point. Is it like it goes to a certain point before we think about that number or like how does that work out? And the question is, is you're figuring out how much to donate of your profits? I mean, when do you figure that out in the beginning or as you get further into it? Do you get to a particular size? Like, because some certain price would want to invest in its own growing before they decide that all of those profits should go... It's really up to you. I mean, if you say you're donating a portion of your profits upfront, you've got to be really transparent with it or people that look at you are going to say, I'm not really sure that they're doing this for the right reasons. So I think you have to do that. I mean, if your end goal is to give back, but you really ultimately just really want to create economic return, I mean, I would focus on the economic return, make the business successful, and then over time, add back a component into the giving back. And if you muddy the water with investors, investors typically either want to come in because it's a social venture, they really want to support you with that, or they want to come in because it's an economic return model they're looking at. And if you mix those in and you go to a traditional VC, they're going to say, well, I don't really... That's not what our investors, our limited partners are all about. So they're probably not going to be as interested. So I guess my answer to that question would be, if you were really doing it ultimately that you want to give something back, I would start with probably not giving something back, make it successful, and then when it's successful, you have a lot more flexibility to be able to do what you want to do with it. Yeah. I'm originally a student from South Korea, and I'm very interested in going to North Korea and doing social research projects here. I'm with the leader of Korea on whether or if ever North Korea opens up its doors to the world. How do you suppose that when foreign social entrepreneurs do go to North Korea, how do they fight communist countries of North Korea where military power is absolute and there's high government corruption? And how do you talk to these cities into getting safe funding? So the question is going from South Korea and doing some kind of a social venture in North Korea with a difficult government situation. And I can only tell you, this isn't really the answer you probably want to hear, but I say away from that kind of stuff. We've done six projects and the one project that failed was a project that did in Uganda and it was an orphanage for child soldiers and we built a well for Christian organization. The government came in and took not only the well, but it took the orphanage and it took the kids. It was horrific. And I try to work in agnostic countries where I don't run that risk. I try to work in countries where governments aren't, they actually like what we're doing because they don't have the money or the funds to be able to do that. So I don't really have a great answer for you other than I kind of try to stay away from some of that stuff. And I think VCs are going to be very, very apprehensive about political risk. Yeah. Qurahtunum, I'm a student from India and I spent a couple of summers ago in Durning in Zambia and in the field of work. And one of the really interesting debates that was going on at the time was about the whole issue of aid. When you're, as a social enterprise, is it, I think it's important to distinguish between philanthropy and actually, say, empowering the people there to be able to generate their own revenue and stuff, their own business. What's your take on that? So the question is, is aid and philanthropy and how engaged are you in, you know, with those in the pub and actually making it a self-sustaining thing rather than just pumping it? Brown is just giving money. I mean, actually getting in from the ground up. And I think it's critical that you do grassroots ground up stuff. Any water project that we do, we actually go turn on. And I do that not so much because I'm worried that they're screwing around, but because I really know these executive directors of these NGOs. But I do it because I want to take people from the United States to actually help turn them on because when they become transformed. But I would strongly vote against just writing a check. I mean, they need checks. They need that kind of stuff. But oftentimes, if you write a check, particularly you're writing a check in the United States NGO, a lot of the, a lot of the, that might get, you know, covered in admin expenses of that NGO. So I would really try to, you know, get engaged and not just give money to, you know, causes, but kind of get involved at the ground at, you know, at a ground works level. And I mean, you've heard of three cups of tea, you know, probably, and, you know, there are some issues with, you know, what happened and all that. But, you know, the one of the points I think is really great about three cups of tea is that, you know, as, as Westerners, we just want to go in and, you know, build the bridge. We just want to go in and do that. But in reality, if we don't actually develop relationships with the locals, engage them in what we're doing, have them feel part of it, have them feel ownership. Now, then they feel like, you know, we're just giving them handouts and it's not so much a hand up. I really, it would encourage you to, you know, get engaged, you know, go there, touch and feel it. And you'll be so much more invigorated, you know, buy it. What are your questions in the red back there? Yeah. I'd like to demand you about Ainta and what she did for the Lagerty. My question to you is, when you first acquired your first company, how did you acquire the funding for it? Was it from investors or personal savings or family members? That's a really good question. And so at first job that I mentioned and I went to after, you know, my cut pace and attach experience was a middle market company. Part of the reason I chose that company was because they had just gone through a private equity transaction. So there was a lot of debt, you know, not a lot of equity, you know, going into it and part of me going there was, you know, they allowed me to invest, you know, whatever amounts I could put in, which wasn't a lot. I didn't really have any money. But I went to a bank. It was at a time when banks would be willing to lend. I borrowed $100,000. I was able to take that $100,000, dumped it all into the business. And over that 12 year period, the company did pretty well and it generated enough seed capital for me to go off on my own and, you know, put that money to work alongside, you know, other, you know, partners. And then I worked with banks and private equity firms to come in and take a portion of that business and I put my own, you know, capital into help do that. Yeah. So I kind of have a small worry about what a lot of them said to you guys and that it almost seems too good to be true. Like, your distributors, like Walmart and retailers who are really profiting off these higher margins, like you said, you're benefiting these organizations that you're supported. And then also as an organization, you're also profiting. Do you think there's any unforeseen, I don't know, problems of some sort and they arise because of this. So the question is the type of model that we're doing, you know, is it authentic or people perceiving it? Are we going to have an issue down the road? Even though Nika donates all of its profits and we're selling through retailers that certainly aren't, you know, doing that, you know, as well. And I mean, I think it all comes back to authenticity and transparency. And if we're really authentic and transparent about it, yeah, I mean, some people are going to not believe it, you know, but I don't really care. I mean, you know, because at the end of the day, if I'm doing good in my heart and I'm creating value and I'm doing what I'm saying I'm doing so that I'm not being a Charlotteson and saying it, you know, there are going to be some people that actually, you know, don't believe me and there's lots of people that don't believe that, you know, it's too good to be true. You can't be donating 100% of your profits. And, you know, I say, okay, well, if you don't want to, if that's fine, you know, that's your model. There are, there is a new development of what's called a certified decorporation, you know, it's kind of evolving, it's kind of the equivalent of the fair trade for the coffee, the coffee importation. And it's, it's, there's only about 500 companies that are part of it yet. We're not. I probably will become part of it because I think it will enhance credibility. But basically what it is is you are very transparent about what you're doing and they come in and they audit that transparency. You know, so there's another kind of check and balance if you will with it. So I think you're going to see a shake out over time and you do hear about, you know, people that start businesses, I mean, the breast cancer, you know, pink ribbon. I mean, there are, you know, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, I don't know how many companies that, you know, are, you know, not doing the right thing by it. I mean, they say they're donating $20 of every purchase, but if you read the Verly Fine Print, they have a cap at, you know, $20,000 or something. And yet they're, you know, they're marketing it that way. So I think in the end, this will shake out because you are seeing a movement to it, but it's going to create, it's going to have to have, you know, more, not regulation, but more kind of boundaries, you know, to help it, to help it shake out. Yeah. So you mentioned, like, to be persistent after a few months, but is it there's, when do you know to be with us? So the question is when do you know to give up and not continue to be persistent and not continue to throw good money after bad or your time? It's so hard. I mean, that's why I think it's important to have a mentor. Again, it doesn't have to be a partner, but have a mentor that can check and balance you and that somebody that can, you know, really, you know, test your strategic plan, test where you're at, test, you know, do a SWAT analysis with you. And you can present your SWAT analysis to them, you know, in terms of what you're looking at. And they can say, you know, I think you got a hole here. I don't agree with you here. I think you're unrealistically optimistic here. I think it's going to cost you more money to do, you know, your marketing campaign here than you think. And at the end of the day, I mean, I look at things like data points. So all I ask 25 people, you know, their opinion on, you know, what I'm doing. And I kind of put those, some people think, well, what are you doing? I mean, it's not like a democracy. It's your business, Jeff. And it's not a democracy, but I want to put all those data points up on the wall. And then how I see that, I draw my line. And I draw my line of that data points based on what I'm hearing and based on what I'm interpreting. So I would encourage you to do that. I do think most people quit as a generalization, you know, too early, just as a generalization. But that's purely a generalization. I think sometimes success is kind of right around the corner and you just got to, you know, persevere with it. Yeah. Just a follow up on her question. I was wondering how we can make the social impact sustainable and to make it grow. Because I understand you just can't go into an area and you build something there, right? And you're hoping that it would, you could leave it and it could grow and grow exponentially. That impact could also travel to other areas. But you would, it would be better if it would not be you anymore who's doing that. It would be the community itself that you empowered. And I was wondering if you're also part of not just, not just building the infrastructure for the water, but also empowering the people themselves to look after themselves and to start thinking about ideas and how to improve their own lives. Right. So the question is, I mean, how do you ensure that you got sustainability, you know, in a particular project once you, once you start it? And, you know, first of all, we work with NGOs. We don't, Nika doesn't actually build the wells themselves. We donate to specific wells and specific projects that we do. And we work with a handful of NGOs that we've vetted. And the NGOs that we work with have a holistic approach to poverty alleviation. So they're focused on water, they're focused on healthcare, they're focused on education, they're focused on microfinance. You know, because if you fix the, if you fix the, the body, but you don't fix the water supply, the body's not going to stay fixed. And you really have to, you know, what I do, you have to holistically, you know, solve it. And they also are very focused on community engagement, community involvement and really engaging those communities. I would not encourage anyone just to, you know, write a check for a single, you know, project out there and expect it to stay. Most of the time you find what I find in the developing world is the projects are, you know, left half finished. And you've got, it's the countryside is littered by wells that were started, but because they didn't have that community engagement, they didn't have that community involvement, or they ran out of funds, or they didn't have that holistic bottom-up approach, you know, it wasn't sustainable. So I really think it's important to, you know, make it as sustainable as you can as holistic as you can. Please join me in thanking Jeff Church for this incredible insight. Thank you. Thank you.
