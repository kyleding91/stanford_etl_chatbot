 Who you are defines how you build. This is the OddPattern thought-leaders series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. On this episode, we're joined by George Skangos. George is the former CEO of Biogen and the current president and CEO of VerbioTechnology, a company that is developing new therapies to fight some of the world's most dangerous infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Here's host and Stanford Structural Biology Professor, Jody Pugelice. The thing that touched me most about George is he was a professor at Johns Hopkins, starting out as a professor when I was a student there. Our paths never crossed because I didn't want to get my hands wet with biology. I was too busy doing chemistry and physics at the time. But that leads me to the question of his own life's trajectory and the exceptionally courageous move that he made in the 1980s to move from a cushy academic job into what was then the nascent field of biotechnology. I really just wanted to start off by asking George to maybe tell a little bit about his trajectory and what pushed him to make this jump from academia to biotechnology. And when you started off getting a PhD, I'm sure you had some vision of what it is you wanted to do. And now sitting where you are now, how is that path diverged or met what you dreamed of years ago? Okay, well first of all, let me say thank you to you, Ravi and to Jody for the invitation. I'm really happy to be here today. This should be fun and interactive and so I encourage people to ask questions. Look, I graduated from Cornell. I was a bio major. I worked for a couple of years for a company that manufactured laboratory supplies from microbiology labs. And I realized after a couple of years that I didn't really care if the labs bought our supplies or the supplies from our competitors that they all worked fine. So it really made no difference so that my efforts were, they were pointless, right? What was the point? But I also learned that I loved what was going on inside the labs and that the microbiology labs at Harvard, I was in Boston or some of the large universities there were really doing fascinating things. And so I decided to go back to graduate school without much thought to what I would do after graduate school. So I went through, I became kind of the default career path to stay in academia. So I went on and did a postdoc at Yale. And then after that, you know, joined the faculty at Hopkins. A few years later, my postdoc advisor, who's going to be in Frank Ruddle, came down to give a seminar at Hopkins. I invited him down, came to give a seminar. And at that time I learned he had, he was stepping down as department chair and he was starting a biotech company. And so I became an advisor to that little biotech company. And so once a week I'd get on there, once a month I'd get on the train from Baltimore and travel up to New Haven to spend the day at the company and working on it. In the, at that time when I was a postdoc at in Frank's lab, we had made the first transgenic mouse. And so there are only a few labs in the world at that time that could make transgenic mouse. Now it's everybody can do it, but it was, was new. And so they asked me and I agreed to take a sabbatical here, take a leave, go to the company, set up a facility so that we could custom make disease models that were more closely than mimic human disease. And we did that and I did that. And I was quite taken by the work there, the science, quality, the science was great. It was way more collaborative than it was in my academic experience. I think that's changed over time. And I was really taken mostly by the idea of spending my time doing research for the real purpose of bringing forward drugs that would improve the lives of patients rather than kind of giving lip service to doing that at the end of an NIH grant. So, but I'm still doing. So I stayed. I took a year to close down my lab and, you know, so, but then I stayed. That little company was bought by Bayer, a big pharmaceutical company. And I ended up working a decade for Bayer. And never, ever would have gone directly from Hopkins into a large pharmaceutical company. That was kind of a nathema to me. But kind of my attitudes got laundered through the small biotech company. I spent a decade working for Bayer. I was, you know, head of R&D. I headed up there big. They made a separate business out of protein drugs, recombinant drugs that were also news. So I headed that business for a while. And then in about 10 years later, I became disenchanted or wasn't one day when you become disenchanted. But over time, I became frustrated with the over-reliance on process and how process sometimes comes. It sounds like an entrepreneurial moment. And so I thought this was ridiculous. And I did have a, there was an aha moment when I was at some off-site team building thing. And I just thought this was the most boring ridiculous exercise that had ever been part of. And I looked around and everybody else was into it. And they liked it. So I said, okay, this is not the right place for me. And I went to a little startup, you know. I had called Excel Exists at the time. It was 20 people. It was newly started. I wasn't a founder, but I was there soon after. Stayed there for 14 years. SEO. It took a public, you know, a couple of drugs now in the market. So it's a successful company. And then I went from there to buy it in large. Buy tech company on many billions of revenue now. And that was a really interesting experience. And then, but that was in Boston. My wife, some of the faculty at UCSF. So that was a trans continental relationship we had. And so, you know, every weekend, one of us would get on the plane. But that gets old after a few years. And so I came back to the Bay Area and we started via. And here I am. Which we'll talk about more and more in depth as we go through the interview. But, you know, as during your voyage from academia to industry, were there any individuals in the world of biotech that, you know, were role models for you? And, you know, one of the things that certainly is a hallmark of your career, are these leadership roles that you took up? And, you know, are there certain models of leadership that you learned? From these people or from your own experience? Yeah, there are several people along the way. If you think about who had an influence, me, my postdoc advisor, Frank Brittle. You know, really great human geneticist, great biologist, great human being, lovely families, wives also, presser at Yale, two lovely daughters. So I learned from Frank a lot about science, but a lot about how to have a career. That was quite consuming and still have a family and a normal life. It was a kind name, Stelios Papadonpolis. So Stelios was a banker for a number of banks that were instrumental in funding the biotech industry in its early days. And was instrumental in doing some of the most creative finances that were done. Today they're illegal, but they were illegal at the time. And helped to get the industry off the ground. And I met him. Which wasn't entirely clear that this was going to be a money making operation. There was a lot of business risk around biotechnology. Not at all. It was speculative. A lot of people thought it was crazy that the whole idea was kind of preposterous. And you could never replicate and make in bacteria or in some artificial system proteins that humans made it would be different. But, you know, he was visionary. He, you know, and making the transition from the academia to industry, don't know what industry is like. You know, and you know it only superficially. And you're, you're in a good situation. I know he's, I was in a good situation. So, you know, doing well and no reason to leave other. And so, making that transition and jumping into the unknown, something new and speculative was not an easy one. Another. And that's still the norm. This, that was a courageous jump at the time. Well, yeah, I know my colleagues at Huck and stuff. I was either crazy or greedy or both. And if we fast forward to now, you know, now the biotech industry is a mature, you know, multi-billion trillion dollar industry perhaps. Yeah. You know, what's changed in your view and, you know, and what are some of the remaining challenges? Well, science has changed a lot. I mean, you know, even, like, you know, conceptually what we were doing at exo-excess in the late 90s, early 2000s. It's conceptually the same as a lot of the work we're doing in beer. Now, except at back then, we had to do these genetic analyses in fruit flies and sea elegance and worms. And it would take six months to do an experiment today. You can do them directly in a main system with CRISPR and get more and more and more relevant information in three weeks. And so the, and that's a combination of advances in the, you know, in biology and, you know, CRISPR and Jennifer Downman, everyone in mobile, President Charlotte Gate. And in data sciences because you generate dreams of data and you have to be able to make sense of it and parse through it. And there's too much to do in your head. So those two things have changed. There have been successes. You know, in the early days, it was easy things. It was insulin. And just fact is that you normally made it now could be made and just never easy. And as the understanding biology has gone on, things have gotten worse. This kid, you can do more challenging things. And there have been successes. So that means money has poured. You know, you have access to level of resources now that was unheard of a decade ago. So let's talk about the science and perhaps some of the business challenges around what you're doing right now, which I think the audience will enjoy hearing about immensely topical, which is your company, Vier. You know, what, what are some of the challenges you face there and maybe given overview of what the company is doing right now and why is so exciting. And I think we thought about Vier at the beginning there, there was, you know, we're focused on infectious diseases. And you know, to start a company focused on infectious diseases is certainly counter to the prevailing views of the industry. Much of the farm industry has either reduced the reference and infectious disease or gotten out completely just shuttered it. Not to us, you can't make money in infectious diseases. And really that's because of antibiotics. And you know, I mean, probably read we desperately knew antibiotics to treat resistant bacteria. The reason we need them so much and nobody's working on them is you really can't make money that if you succeed and make a new antibiotic, it is reserved for last line use. Because physicians are appropriately concerned that overusing it will result in the development of resistance to that one too. So they want to save it for when it's truly needed. And so it's a low volume product. And because of the way how the antibiotics are prescribed and treated, the price is capped. So it's a low priced product. And it's an acute product. You take it for a few days or a couple weeks and then you're done. And the next time you use get sick, there's no brand loyalty. You don't come back to that one. You take whatever you get prescribed for your next one. And so all of those things combined to make antibiotics a terrible business model. And there were biotech companies that made very good antibiotics that went bankrupt, even though they had approved drugs. And so on the other hand, a billiard in the Bay Area has tens of billions of dollars of revenue treating viral diseases, treating HIV, hepatitis C. hepatitis C is also acute. You take their drug for a short period of time, you're cured of hepatitis C. The irrational part is the healthcare system is willing to pay $30,000 to rid you of hepatitis C, but they're not willing to pay $4,000 to rid you of an antibiotic resistant bacteria that will kill you. It's not rational, but it's the way the healthcare system is. But because so many of the companies had backed out, we saw need a huge infectious disease problems. And antibiotic resistant bacteria, one flu, tens of thousands of people die from flu every year. Hepatitis B, which infects to almost 300 million people around the world, TV infects a couple billion people around the world. So there's a huge public health need. And for the right indications, also a tremendous amount of money to be made if we were to be successful. So we went all in on infectious diseases. Our goal was to be the biotech company focused on infectious diseases and be able to compete head to head with whatever large companies were still in the running. We raised a lot of money, we raised almost $600 million initially. That's unusual, I think maybe the audience has an appreciation that's an enormous war chest. It's in order magnitude more than most startups get. These days a little more, maybe $100 million, but it was $50 or $60 million. There's still a lot of money, right? The idea was to go make some acquisitions, signs of deals, hire in a really good company group of people. And go forward really aggressively, roll up other assets in the biotech industry that were underfunded, under exploited, and become the leading biotech company infectious diseases. So it was pretty aggressive plan. And we were on our way, we had really interesting programs and flu and hepatitis B. We had a program with the Gates Foundation to make a vaccine for HIV and TB. And so we're doing interesting things. And then COVID came. And so we had some assets and some ways to approach COVID. And I met with January 5th when our chief scientific officer, our Ganym Skip version, came to me and said, this is the big one. This is going to be a huge impact and we should work on this. And so we started really early and pretty aggressively. And for a company like ours, we made some big bets because we're not a huge company. We didn't want to stop the other programs. We had to add this to them, which means we had a staff up, hire more people, spend more money. We're bringing forward antibodies, which now fortunately look like they're going to work. But we had to make hundreds of millions of dollars of commitments for manufacturing contracts in the future. And those are take or pay. So you pay for them whether or not your product succeeds and you need them or not. So that's a huge, almost existential gamble for a company like ours. I mean, I don't we wouldn't have made it if we thought it was truly existential, but it was closed. And so now we've been focused on COVID as well as those other two. And obviously COVID's getting all the attention these days. Maybe you can comment a little more broadly for the audience about the spectrum of therapies and approaches that are being taken by the industry to COVID. And sure what the outlook looks like. Yeah, start with vaccines. And they seem to get most of the news these days. A lot of different approaches, Moderna and then Pfizer together with a company called BioNTech German company on developing RNA based vaccines probably near and dear to your heart. That's that's a new technology has not been tried on a large scale basis before. You know, the early data, I would say, are kind of encouraging, but not certainly not conclusive. And we'll see, you know, there are each and rolling for vaccine trials. You've got to enroll tens of thousands of patients. So there, I think they're targets for 30 or 40,000 patients. And we'll see how well they work. J and J and AstraZeneca, AstraZeneca working with Oxford University are developing vaccines based on adenovirus. They have different strains of adenovirus. My view is J and J has the more promising of the two, but that's just, I mean, maybe a bias more than based on any hard, hard data. And then there are companies, GSK and Sonofi are two really good vaccine companies working together on a more traditional vaccine. So protein with an adjuvant going. So those are going, I, the early data, I would say are somewhat encouraging. They do generate antibody responses, whether it's enough antibodies, the right kind of antibodies don't know how long the antibody response lasts. We don't know whether it works in all age groups, all forces of population. We don't know. And people tend to think of vaccines like a panacea, you'd get it and it's like, you know, smallpox when you're a kid or something. If you get it, you're immune. Well, that's one extreme. The other example is not even extreme. It might be flute where you know, you get it. And on average, the vaccine reduces transmission of flu by about 40%. And less than that in the elderly and the people who need it most. So we'll see where the vaccines go. Hopefully I, for all of our sinks, I hope they work really well. I think it's unlikely they'll work sufficiently well in all segments of population and will need other approaches. So literally and we and AstraZeneca are bringing forward antibodies. I'm really published actually really interesting data this morning to say they're anybody's work. And there are anybody's again, very small numbers still. But in their placebo group, I think it was 2.9% of patients. These are patients early in their COVID course, so they're not hospitalized. 2.9% were hospitalized in the placebo group and the treated group 0.9%. So we call it from 3 to 1 to 2 thirds reduction. Huge error bars around that number because the numbers are so small, but still pretty compelling that the antibodies are providing benefit for those patients. You know, we're generally on has some data. And over the course of the next few months, you know, everybody will have enough data to know to what extent the antibodies are working. But I think the early signs are that they're going to be. It's from happening at a remarkably fast timescale and you know, you have a role as a CEO of a company, but you're also in a leadership role for the biotech industry at large through an organization called Bio. Can you maybe comment a little bit how you know, how you wear those multiple hats and that kind of thing? Sure. Well, look, my primary responsibility is VR. That's my day job. And I have to make sure that our programs are going forward rapidly. And we don't miss any beats here. So far, so good. We're on our way. You know, we went just to give you an example. We started this. I said in January 5th saying we should find an antibody that is effective. And that entered clinical trials in August. So, you know, we found it. We had a manufactured. We got the regulatory approval. Everything is in seven months. That's a two to three year process in normal times. So incredibly accelerated. Lily and Regenerate did the same. And we signed a car. We know we're working together with JSK on this. We have a collaboration with them. And we had a collaboration around COVID from the initial phone call I had with Hal Baron is head of R&D at JSK. Until we had assigned agreement was three weeks. That never has. Am I all my years? I've never had an agreement signed in three weeks. You know, if three months is fast. And so COVID is brought. So COVID has changed the rules. Right. Because it is a pandemic. There's a huge people are dying every day. And this is a good place to ask a broader question because many of our audiences are engineers and, you know, the drug development is a biotechnologies of very different type of activity. Maybe some of your thoughts about the differences in the in biotech versus kind of traditional tech companies and maybe some of the opportunities for the smart young kids to go out and change the world. Look, I think but look biotech is so exciting because it's a mixture of these days of science, medicine of data sciences, biophysics. And you need to bring all that together. And, and they all plan each other and they all compliment each other. We have an amazing data sciences group. And they're actually based on the same Diego incredible insight that we get and they get it. You know, MIT runs these structural biology competitions. So they give you a learning set of compounds to say here is the activity of these compounds on this arguments. And then they give you another set of compounds to say now you learn from these and tell us which of these others are going to have the most effect and then they run competitions to see you can do that. We've entered to we won one and we're second to the other. So we're doing okay. And, but it's amazing. The insights we you know we think now we have gene expression patterns that can predict which patients will have bad outcomes to COVID or flu. And then we're just based on the expression of lymphoid cells. Yeah, I mean, this is a remarkable remarkable steps forward the technologies that are available. So the data sciences are incredible. The, you know, in the biology is amazed in the genetics. Yeah, you're talking about it already, but you know within the companies that you've led in a creating that cauldron of creativity and innovation, which is so essential to any entrepreneurial exercise. Now what kind of approaches have you taken to ensure that? I mean, that seems essential ingredient. So look, I think you need to write people. I think the success of companies like ours is really dependent on the people. You need people who have a little bit of an iconoclastic attitude, who are, let's say arrogant enough to think they can succeed where everybody else has failed, but humble enough to know that that probably won't happen. And so yeah, these kind of conflicting characteristics you need in the people and the organization. And so the selection of the right people is absolutely critical. And you know, a lot of people who are comfortable in larger companies are just not the right people, even if they have all the right expertise that you need. Absolutely. So you need that. You need a sense of, to instill a sense of urgency and you have to motivate people. Like people don't come to work every day thinking, geez, I'm excited to go to work because if we do a good job, we'll make a lot of our money, a lot of money for investors who are already wealthy. That is not something that gets me out of bed in the morning. You need the motivation has to be I'm excited to go to work because if we succeed, we're going to improve the lives of a lot of people. And I think personally, because we have the ability to do that, we have the responsibility to do that. And so, if so many people are suffering. And so, you know, I've had discussions with the boards along the years, you know, because there are certain people who believe that the function of a CEO is only to increase the value of the stock and do well by shareholders. I personally don't want to be part of a company that does that and has that as their motive operating. I think that's actually irresponsible. And of course, you have shareholders, of course, you have responsibilities to them. And you have to generate a return. And if you don't do that, you won't be CEO forever. It's not that you can't do that, but you can't do that as your sole focus. We have responsibilities to patients, we have responsibilities to our employees, we have responsibilities to the community, to the environment. I mean, we have to operate in socially responsible ways. And so, the nice thing to me about the biotech industry is that its focus is on improving the world, on improving the lives of people who are suffering in one way or the other. And so, if we succeed, then we have accomplished an important social good at the same time. If we do it thoughtfully, we can return a substantial return to ourselves and our investors. So, I think it's a, you know, you asked me at the beginning what I thought about my career. I never thought about this, but I can't envision having ended up in a better place. It's a remarkable story and a remarkable voyage. And I think, you know, certainly resonates with me and even more so, I'm sure resonates with the students in the class that are part of the generation that I think really do want to make a difference and change the world. And, you know, are looking for avenues to do that. And, you know, you're a shining example of that. And, you know, we're all rooting for your success. Not just financially, but in terms of your clinical trials and the success against not just coronavirus, but the next waves of infectious diseases that are sure to hit us. I'll ask one last question, which is, you know, what does the future of biotech hold? You know, where do you see the field going over the next 20 years? And no one's going to hold you to your predictions. Look, it's incredible. You know, if you think about the progress that we've made over the last 20 years, and you extrapolate that forward, it's just incredible. But I think extrapolating in forward isn't sufficient because the pace at which we're advancing is accelerating. So I have to take this, the second derivative, actually, you know, to think. And that's really hard to imagine. But I think we'll be able to already start to be able to manipulate genes. We understand the genetic basis of disease, to intervene, to find ways to intervene safely. I mean, nobody intervenes now in, like, changing genomes. Yeah. Yeah, changing genome with CRISPR, or you can do a lot of... There's still some safety concerns, those are not adequately addressed yet. And then, of course, there are a lot of ethical concerns that people have as well. But over time, we'll figure out how to do that safely. And change a gene that gives you a predisposition to atherosclerosis or Alzheimer's or whatever. To avoid those, minimize those. And so I think the combination of genetics and, you know, you can't figure all this out just by laboratory experiments. A lot of it has to be guided computationally. It's just, it's amazing. You know, understanding brain circuits, being able to intervene in psychiatric issues, depression. Yeah, I think neurological diseases are a huge, huge... Yeah, so an area of opportunity. And also the aging population in the world, in all areas that will need focus. And if you think about now, or we, you know, a clinic, we can tell you if you were to... Like, you know, we take a blood sample today and tell you, if you get COVID, you are or you are not going to have a bad outcome. You know, if that were a simple diagnostic test that could be run by hospital, I'd rather than a really complicated test. That would be huge. But then you could do your clinical trials only in those people are going to have bad outcomes. So you would save money because you're not treating a lot of people who don't need your treatment. You, I think, is highly ethical to do that because, you know, every drug has side effects. And if no, and people aren't going to benefit or they don't need it, but you expose them to this side effects anyway, that's not really an ethical thing to do. And just for the audience, that's a term called pharmacogenomics, trying to understand how your genetic makeup affects your response to drugs, which is, of course, a super exciting area of research. And one that involves lots of computation and lots of measurements and lots of analysis. The opportunities are immense. So I think all that's going to change. So, you know, the one thing that could get in the way, not the one thing, but, you know, we have to keep funding the industry well. It has to keep providing a return to investors. So they, you know, keep funding it. You know, I don't think this is a discussion on drug prices, but there are certain solutions to drug prices that would crush that. And there are other solutions that wouldn't. So it's not an insoluble problem, but some of the knee-jerk reactions, I think, would just crush it. So, you know, as long as we have the right social environment, I think, you know, the, you know, students who are now in school can expect to have longer, healthier lives than we have. And we already have longer, healthier lives than my parents have. So, yeah. It's been remarkable. George, thank you so much. Maybe we'll open this up to some questions in the Q&A. So the first question is, you know, how valuable has your technical PhD been while leading a biotechnology firm? You know, and if you knew you would end up there, would you have still gone and gotten a PhD? And maybe I'll add to this, you know, how do you learn your business skills? Well, I know that's a personal question for me. Yeah. I enjoy getting a PhD. I enjoy the science. I enjoy the R&D, and it does help running the company. We are R&D-based company. So I don't have to be the best scientist in our organization, and I'm not. But I have to know it enough to know who is, right? To ask the right questions and be able to manage it. And so much of the success of our company is based on the quality of the science that we do and the science and medicine as well. So yes, it's been helpful. You do a CEO have to manage obviously the entire company. Many of disciplines you don't have any personal experience in. Manufacturing. And for me, commercial. You know, human resource, all the people issues, finance. And so you just, you know, I've learned that kind of biosmosis. I didn't do an MBA. And you know, when I work for Bear Large Pharmac, one of the benefits of that is they send you to training courses if they think you have some potential. So, you know, it did some mini MBAs and things like that. But those aren't really that. I mean, they're pretty superficial. And so basically learn things as you go. And you get some exposure. Yeah, ask some questions and you learn my experience with most of this stuff is the principles are not that difficult. Right? So, you know, the concept of a NPV. Very straightforward. It's very simple concept. Sitting down to do one, not that complicated, but it takes some learning. But what's crucial for that is the assumptions that you put into it. And so being able to learn enough to say, okay, this is entirely dependent on the assumptions that go into it. Let's question those assumptions. And the rest is math. Then, you know, kind of going back to first principles, you get through a lot of things. So, you know, you kind of have a lot of problems with the research that you're not going to have any formal training in. There's a related question, which I think you've already answered, which is how can people who don't have PhDs be involved in the commercialization of research? Well, we need people who are involved in the commercialization. The company needs, I mean, we even, we don't have any products to sell yet. As you have to start planning for how to commercialize things well in advance of when you actually have them. You have to start, you have to understand the markets. I think one of the key things for companies I've taught for a long time is you have to solve problems that actually exist, not that you think exist. And that's not only scientific problems and, you know, technical issues. It's commercial issues, you know, is there a need for this? How would it be used? Are there some flaws in your thinking? So, even if you're technically successful, no one's going to use it. And so, you need to understand those issues. So, you need people who understand the market, who can interact with the prescribers and the physicians and the health plans, who are going to pay for this and Medicare and other agencies to understand whether what's important to them. George, without naming names, could you, can you give it an example over, you know, the last 30 years or so of an example of that where a product was developed, of which there was no use, because there wasn't the commercialization plan. Oh, there have been many. And it, well, I give you the recent one. It's not that there's no use, like the PCSK9 inhibitors. These are new drugs that are really potent in reducing LDL cholesterol, reducing cholesterol. So, for people who are not adequately controlled on that, and so they can be a life saver. And so, there are two or three of us now on the market. They are really good drugs, but they were priced at a level where all of the payers said, no, thank you. We're not paying for this. The benefit to our patients does not merit that cost. And so, they're actually used very little. And they are potentially life-saving drugs. And so, that was an error not in the product, but in how to, how to, how to price it into the marketplace. Gilead, when they introduced their hep-scene treatment. This is a treatment that cured hepatitis C, like 98 or 99% cure rate. And I think the one or two percent of people just aren't compliant. We have to take pill every day for a period of time. And they charged, you know, I think initially they charged $40,000 for that treatment. Thank God, so much grief for that. Very good, a lot of grief. And they charged it. It was, you know, basically it was $1,000 in pill, right? Because you had to take pill once a day and you think, just divide it up as a thousand. So, people looked at the pills and said $1,000 per dollar pill. So, when you actually do their cost-benefit relationship, they saved more money to the health care system by writing cancer and liver cirrhosis, menacos. But it was the cosmetics, so they didn't deal with that. And they did it well. Most of those patients are unmiticated. And they didn't talk with the state Medicaid agencies and prepare them. So, they all had their budgets just completely ruined. And so, they pushed back. So, there are ways that you need to prepare the market to interact with payers that are crucial to the success of the product. George, can I ask you two quick questions before we get cut up? Which I think are good ones. One is, you know, who is a CEO or industry leader that you look up to besides yourself? Ken Frazier. Ken is the CEO of Merck. He is, I think, incredibly capable, decent, thoughtful, and has done an amazing job leading Merck to be a really innovative company. So, you know, I got to work with him back when I was at Biogen. And I have a huge amount of respect for Ken. So, he's at the top of my list. And then, I guess the final question that I'll go through is, what's your advice for someone looking to enter the biotech in industries and undergrad? Do you think that focusing on honing bio knowledge, bio undergraduate or graduate studies is important to do for entering industry? Or do you do, do you recommend entering the industry in college itself by internships? Look, I think you should do what you're passionate about and what you enjoy. Because my experience is it's when you do that that you do the best. And so, achieve excellence to the extent that you can in a field that's of interest to you. So many different fields are relevant to biotech companies, biology, commercial, finance, legal, you know, technical manufacturing, data sciences, so many ways to get involved in the industry. Pick what you like and pick where you want, where you have some passion and where you don't mind and actually enjoy spending 67 to 8 hours a week working at it.
