 You were listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader's Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. I was really lucky and I'm very lucky to still know him. He was a little lucky known when he was a student here. And that was just a little while ago. He was in the Computer Science Department and he had that job that many of you probably heard about. But you know in 106A, in the Computer Science 101, there's the section leaders, the TAs, and then there's the coordinator in a class for those TAs. That coordinator is a very special position. So that's when I first met John because he held that position in the late 90s. Maybe early 90s. And then I had the luck. Every once in a while, professors allowed to be on a board of directors. So he started a company as the CEO of that company called Reactivity. And I was on that board for a while. So I got to see him in action as an entrepreneur and CEO. And then to fast forward, he's now at Graylock, one of the top venture capital firms in the entire world doing a really, really good job there. So we're so glad that he's here. He's on his way to the basketball game tonight. But he stopped by to talk with us. So let's give John a big homecoming welcome. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. So this is highly stressful to get up in front of you right and talk. It's been a little while since I've done this. So I'll do the best I can. The, I guess I should mention, you know in Thomas on my board, he, the first thing you did when you first started talking about is like, well, are you guys, I'm trying to figure out, are you guys assholes or not? Because life's too short to work with assholes. And so that was the first conversation we talked about when he was talking about being on the board. And then the first, the first official board meeting we had after we took money from Excel, got an impeter fendon and Mitch K. Poor, Mitch, Mitch was there and Tom came in and I think Mitch said, Tom, the last time I saw you was on the board meeting for this incredibly defunct company. I'm like, oh, so the last collaboration they had done was a company that had gone out of business. But it, it worked better than that. Yeah. Tom did all right. So one of the first things you do when you're trying to figure out a talk is you, you're trying to figure out a title. And I thought about this a long time. I thought about a lot of, I've rejected many titles. So this is the title I decided to give. How do you give a job like mine? So it's a, it's a reference. So one of my favorite authors has got named Kurt Vonnegut. And he gave many talks during his career. They were all named how to get a job like mine where he would give, he would say, this is the talk I'm going to give and he would get up and talk about whatever he wanted to talk about. He never talked about how to get a job like his. The one time he said, people should use fewer semicolon's, that's about all he did in terms of that. But I liked it because Kurt, Kurt was interesting. He built a career that didn't look like anybody else's career. In a funny way, like a lot of the things that Kurt Vonnegut wrote, it's kind of humorous and absurd on the surface, but there was a real truth to it because what he was, I think my point of view is that what he's really saying is like the way to get a job like mine, it's like, well, I'm just me. Be who you are and try to figure that out. And then don't try to be anybody else and don't try to get anybody else's job. Just be, just be the guy you are. And so that's why I wanted to call it like that. And I was actually reminded of it because of Aaron Swartz, who I didn't meet but made a big difference for a lot of people on the internet. When he killed himself a couple of weeks ago under indictment from the federal government, he's, what's a long story, but he's been a freedom, an information freedom person for a long time. And he gave a non-ironic talk called How to Get a Job Like Mine About Three or Four Years ago, and that's what I was reminded when I was thinking about this talk. So it's sort of an homage to Kurt Vonnegut and Aaron Swartz. So I'll do the TLDR. So I know what TLDR is. So all the computer scientists in the room, TLDR is too long didn't read. So it's when you, when you're in the comments and like kind of tech or charticle or something like that said, well, this article is really long. So I didn't really read it, but here's what I think anyway. So I'll just give you the TLDR. So the TLDR, there's three rules that I live. And what I'm going to do today is I'm going to talk a little bit about how I think about the world. And I'll talk about my path from sitting in a chair pretty much like these chairs, all that not as nice 20 years ago, through being an engineer and an entrepreneur and a CEO and a VC. And then I'll talk a little bit about what we do at Greylock and how we think about things and a little bit about what I think the future holds. So I have three rules and it's kind of the frame, the framing. Here's the first thing. Make things and a lot of them. You make things as long as you can, be a maker. The best thing about Stanford is it teaches you how to do things and put products into the world. And the people that I interact with, the people that I like being with now, the people who really can see things and be product people and can make things themselves. The second two rules actually both came from Tom Cosnick and I'll talk about it in just a second. And they've stuck with me for 20 years now. These are not quite his words. These are read Hoffman's words. What Tom said, when I was, Tom Cosnick said, when I was just coming out of Stanford in 1995, is he said, you need to figure out the people who you want to be on your team. You need to look around at the 23 year olds, 24 year olds who are coming out of Stanford now and in Silicon Valley now and figure out the ones you want to work with and play with and collaborate with because 20 years from now you're going to be running Silicon Valley. And that really stuck with me and it affected the way I think. And it affected the way even that my interactions with Reed, so I'm a partner with Reed Hoffman who found it linked in a gray lock, he and I have collaborated in a number of ways. His version of it is find your tribe. Figure out who's on your side. Figure out who's not on your side and be super clear about it. And invest in the people who are on your tribe always. It's not a static thing, so keep renewing and keep bringing people in but really, really invest in it. And so I think I can't say this super strongly enough, but the people who you work with are just about everything. I'll focus on recruiting and collaboration through my whole talk. And what you'll see is that we've some of the same people in, even though I work with new people all the time, we've some of the same people and the same influences like Tom Causdink and Tom Piers through my whole talk. It matters. It's everything I think. And the third thing is something that Tom says, do what makes your soul sing. And what he meant is that do stuff that speaks to you. So changing the world is hard. Mostly people don't want change. Mostly the status quo is the status quo because people are kind of comfortable with it. And it's easier to keep it the way it is than to change it. Being an entrepreneur is super hard. Nobody wants Uber except for Uber at the beginning. Nobody wants to communicate in 140 characters sound bites except for Avon Bizz when they started it. And so you have to make the world the way it is. They're vested interests that want to keep the world how it was. And so because it's hard and because it's constantly hard and because people are telling you you're moron and why things won't work over and over and over again. It's important to do things that really speak to you and feed your soul and help you grow over time. And I think that we forget about growth a lot of times. I think we now say, well, you're 20 or 22 and you dropped out of school and you should be able to run a multi-billion dollar company. And I think I say that kind of tongue in cheek but I submit to you that many people believe it. But I think we forget that growth is human and growth is key. And so finding things that make your soul sing that speak to you and you love and that grow you as a person over time is the thing. Those are my rules. That's it. Everything else is a detail. So here's some background. This is seventh grade. That's me. This is our computer club in Las Vegas. So seventh grade and that's my friend Adam. This is, nobody's going to remember this but this is a pet. This is a Commodore pet computer or maybe the one before the pet. This is a floppy disk drive. It's got special, because it had two floppy disk spaces and that was a printer. And I guess we had one computer for the club. I don't totally remember it. But Adam and I played a lot of Zork together. Nobody knows what that is. It was an adventure game. There was not a lot of pictures and a lot of texts. But we did that a lot. And then we split. I moved and he moved. And it was interesting because later we kind of reconnected over the web. And it turns out that he did the same work that I did in school. So he became sort of obsessed with how people use computers and how the sociological impact. And so he started doing computer design and computer interaction just like I did. I think a lot of that goes all the way back to what we were interested in seventh grade. So most often when asked to identify what I am by training is I say I'm a Stanford engineer. How many people are engineers in the room? Yeah. So I've sat in your seat and I've fallen asleep in your seat once or twice. And I'll tell you a story about that in a second. So I did a BS in computer systems. There's like half the B and half computer science. And I did a MS in computer science. And I did something called HCI with Schema computer interaction with the very, very early days of this. And I'll tell a story about that in a second too. The best, Tom mentioned this, but the best decision I probably ever made, the best work decision I've ever made was to be a section leader in Stanford. And the reason, I was at a D school class this morning. And one of the quotes that they made is the job of the job of the leaders to create other leaders. And going through that in CS198 and helping people learn how to teach other amazing students in Stanford was such a fundamental experience for me that had changed how I thought about everything really. And it turns out that in practice, you can see this network blossoming everywhere in Silicon Valley. Marissa Meyer from Yahoo who was a section leader. Brett Taylor, the former CTO of Facebook, Mike Shreve for the VP Engineering of Facebook. All these people are section leaders. And the lineage is an extremely impressive one. And I think it all goes back to think about how to create other leaders and how to teach other teachers. So that was the best work that I've ever made, Barnum. My most embarrassing moment that I'm willing to talk about on film was in CS547 in about 1993 when I fell asleep when this guy from Switzerland, and Robert Kelly who brought this ridiculous box, there's this big black box that's called the next computer which is where Steve Jobs went after Apple. And he did this demo or this thing and called a webpage. And I fell asleep while I was doing it. And it was in skilling auditorium and I just didn't get it because I saw pictures and texts and click, click, click, click, click, click some links and there's some other things. And I said, well, this, I fell asleep. And then I woke up and everybody was leaving. And so anyway, after that I rallied and so I did better. The thing that I read, the thing that changed my life in my, all my career, you know, when I came in to Stanford, I was really interested in the kind of stuff that John Hennessey was doing. The, and I'll talk about computer architecture, about how to make computers go fast, fast, fast. And then I had a couple of mentors at internships that I was at at Sun, which is not kind of where you think about HCI coming from, but also here at Stanford. And there was a guy, a guy in my dorm is Sean White, who will be, I'll talk about through this piece, through the conversation today. And Sean kept telling me I should do this thing called HCI. Sean was Terry, one of Terry went to grads, very first grad students in design. At a time, we were just trying to figure out what the difference in design was in human factors and usability. And Sean said, you've got to do this, you'll love it. And I was resistant, really resistant. I was like, no, no, I'm a computer architecture guy. I'm going to do multi-core instruction sets in Silicon. And obviously I just really wasn't interested in HCI. And then I read this piece by guy Mitch K. And Mitch is the founder of Lotus. He was one of the first people that really successfully commercialized the spreadsheet. And he wrote this piece called a software design manifesto. And what he said is that software needs architects, just like buildings need architects. I think we think about this, I think it's obvious now, but it was obvious in 1991. And it's interesting, because I was just reading it today. And what he said in 1991 is that the revolution hasn't succeeded. And what started is this very human counterculture thing to give PCs to people. That was a revolutionary idea in the 80s. And what he said is, well, shit, this has become the mainstream. Now computers are defining us instead of us defining computers. And when I read this bold thing, he could have written this today. And he could have written about mobile instead of computers and phones instead of computers. And what he could have said is like, the revolution hasn't yet succeeded because in spite of the amazing progress and the amazing work that we're doing with these things, we're still not fundamentally human in our interaction with technology. And again, that's a thread that's led all the way through my career. And I think we're finally waking up to it. I think Steve coming back to Apple finally woke up the world about how important design, how important human factors is to have more importantly, how important a thing about technology in context could be and how powerful it could be. So, you know, it's changed my life and eventually, well, I'll come back to that in a second. I do want to come and call it Chulji Software out of Stanford. And as a VC, there's a funny thing that happens, which is if you come pitch me, like, there's a hide, I believe there's a high degree of likelihood that I can tell you where your first job was, if it was at Google or Apple or Amazon. And it's because when you, the first place you go out of school tends to imprint you. And you, so Google, they tend to have a very, very sort of, let's AB test kind of attitude. You know, Apple tends to have a very, very slow design point of view. Zingga was like Google AB testing, but like times 10. And you tend to really, really take the lessons of the first place you work through your whole career. Chulji, the key was recruiting. All they cared about was getting awesome, awesome people. And Trilji wasn't a successful company ultimately. I mean, it's still around, it's saying okay, but thank God I went there because recruiting is so central and so core. Whether you're a startup or a growing company now, and that's been another lesson. So I think that picking your first company, whether, and even whether you pick, choose to start up or not, is a key key decision. Choosing a start, Joe Kraus, the founder of Excite, and a friend, he's a partner at Google Ventures now. He likes to say you learn more from successful companies than you do from failures. If going off and doing your own thing that fails, you learn a lot. But you don't always learn the right things. And then going to a company that's successful is like a rocket ship. And you know, a guy like Matt Kohler is a good example. So Matt joined Reed, as he was starting LinkedIn. And he saw so many things going right at LinkedIn. And then he went to, he joined Zach at Facebook. And now he's a partner at benchmark. But I think seeing the right, seeing good examples of the right kind of scaling, the right kind of organization building is huge. I mean, failing is okay too, but it's not as good as winning. So then I went to Apple where I had been as an intern. I learned how to play with technology. And I was in a part of Apple that we were looking at education, we were looking at playfulness, we were looking at children. And that was fun. Because I started learning about how to tackle big problems of small solutions. And it was when Steve came back. And the happy thing for me is that Steve really didn't like my group very much. And so he started firing everyone. Which caused my group to die and a lot of people that I cared about to leave. And it helped me leave to start my own company. And I was kind of grateful for that. But there are some interesting Steve job stories. And the one I'll tell you is that he came back at a time when the market cap of Apple was about approximately equal to the cash we had on hand. And nobody remembers this. And it sounds ridiculous. It's the time when Microsoft was dominant. Sun was incredible. Sun looked like Sun was going to buy Apple. And I know none of you remember this. But it looked like Apple was dead. And Steve came back because Apple acquired next and then he took over. And nobody believed in it. And I remember this town hall in a room for ATG for the Advanced Technology Group. And a room about this size and Steve was up on stage. And in the press the day before, the press that asked Michael Dell, who started Dell computer, what Apple should do. It's like, well, shit, I think they should give the money back to the shareholders and shut the thing down. So obviously he's got some points now given the things that Dell's going through. And how Apple's done since then. But you know, so Steve gave this big talk about how they're going to reinvent Apple. And somebody asked him, what do you think about what Michael Dell said? And Steve paused and he said, well, fuck Michael Dell. And on no joke, he said, fuck that guy. And so he said, you know what we're going to do? We're going to reinvent the company. Yeah, I'm sorry. I know it's broadcast down. I am who I am. Eight seconds delay or something. We should pause and give me an eight second delay. It's going to happen again. So anyway, so Steve said, you know what? We're going to build a great company. We're going to reinvent the world. And anybody who believes me, let's get moving. If you don't believe that happened, then get the hell out. And this was an amazing active leadership because it was so clear who was in and who was out. And I'll tell you, people in the room would have followed Steve everywhere. And anywhere, just about anywhere. Now, it turns out me and my friends left. And we're happy with that decision, although economically it probably would have been better to stick around. We've all done OK. But what an active leadership by a guy who nobody believed in at the time. Nobody believed it. So after that, I left. And I started my company called Reactivity. And I don't know what to say about Reactivity. I'll tell you, being a founder is such a complex set of things. We started it in my kitchen with my mentor from Apple and my best friend from Stanford, who was a section leader. And then one of the people who went through the HCI program with me is Stanford. And I still can't process it exactly. I'm very, very proud of what we built. We eventually sold it to Cisco a few years later. But again, I think the recruiting and mentors and connections was the thing. We got Mitch K. Port, invest in us from Excel. I've collaborated on him in a number of things. And he was the way I eventually got to Mozilla. There's another guy from Excel named Peter Fenn, who's now a partner at Benchmark. And Peter stayed on the board longer than I did. It's longer than I lasted at the company. So I was there for seven years. Peter lasted two more years beyond that. And as I see so many founders now, think about venture investing or getting that A around as a transaction. I just need to get this done as fast as I can and get the money in the bank and move on. It's such a crazy point of view from my perspective. Because you're going to be with these people for years. They're going to affect the way you think. You're going to affect the way they think. You're going to have up times, down times, you're going to yell at each other. You're going to go through happy times. And it's really, really careful. As important, how to choose your investors as it is, how to choose your management team. You can fire your management team. You can't fire your investors. And so I don't know. I was very, very lucky. Because I didn't really understand how far reaching a decision it was when I took money from Mitch and Peter. It worked out very, very well for us, emotionally and in its business as well. And then the best accident of my career that I joined Mozilla. So in 2005, I was going through this period where I was trying to figure out what to do. And I thought I was going to do venture. And I just couldn't find the right venture firm for me then. And I accidentally, because of Mitch, I actually got sort of involved with the Mozilla people. And Mozilla at the time had just launched Firefox about three or four months earlier. They had just signed a deal with Google that made it economically viable. It was an open source nonprofit, which is not exactly what you're looking for when you're doing a job search. But I couldn't escape it. I felt this incredibly strong gravitational pull to go work on the browser. Because the web felt so important and so under pressure at the time. And again, you won't remember this. But I'll show you why that's important. So this is what it looked like just before I got there. And again, you're not going to remember this. So Microsoft was dominant, dominant dominant, 96% of the computers in the world. I see all I see out here is Max. It wasn't the case in 2004. 96% of the computers in the world that people used for Windows. And all of them, all of them used Internet Explorer. So those are bad. There's such a finished chapter that Microsoft took their Internet Explorer team. And they said, you guys are not working on Internet Explorer anymore. Mission accomplished. And they put them all in Silverlight, which is, as you know, is going to be huge. This was a mistake that Microsoft made. It took them years and years and years to come back from. And I would argue that it really opened the door for a quick downfall for Microsoft. Four years later, in 2008, we were about a quarter market share. 9% is operand safari and so on and stuff. And then now, this is IE, about 55% depending on how you count. This is Chrome and this is Firefox. Again, depending on how you count. And this is some other stuff, safari and safari and opera. And if you include mobile, the world changes quite dramatically. And I'll show that in just a second. But from most of those point of view, this is what we wanted. Like, we didn't want the same as this, but orange. We wanted robust. We probably could be happy with the beliefs that are smaller. But this is what we wanted. We wanted a robust competitive market where you had people innovating and trying to be good for consumers. Because we thought that was our mission of a nonprofit. And I feel like in large part, we made that happen. It's more to talk about how we made it happen. Because we were this funky, odd, open source thing that nobody much understood. And I'll tell you, I think it took Microsoft for two years to figure out what the hell we were doing. And I say that because we weren't trying to be them. We weren't going to trade shows. We weren't doing deals with Dell. We weren't doing any of this shit. What we were doing is we were trying to find the biggest community we could and make them all owners. Make as many people responsible for translation and code and distribution and user interface as we could. And I show this picture. This is a picture of the internet a while ago. It was smaller than. And what the internet especially is called, this system called chaotic systems. And chaotic systems are sort of half chaos and half order. But they're roughly, they're kind of, they're multi-nodal systems where you have multi-nodal authority and no center of gravity. And so that's what the internet is and that's what Mozilla is in many ways. So we had people who were responsible and we really gave them responsibility whether they worked for us or not. And it was just, we competed asymmetrically. We were open source. They didn't understand, Microsoft didn't understand what to do with that. How can you compete if you give your source code away? We were community driven. We were nonprofit. Like, now it turns out that Mozilla makes many hundreds of millions of dollars a year now. And we profit a significant portion of that. So nonprofit is more of a mission statement than it is a balance sheet statement. We're a pretty, we're a pretty successful nonprofit. And I'm sort of obsessed with nonprofits and sustainability, which is why I'm involved in code for Americans and other nonprofits now. We didn't try to be them. I think that's true too. I was talking to some people at the school this morning. And the success, the most interesting successful companies that scale Facebook, LinkedIn, Pandora, and any of these, I think they're all different. And so they're not all afraid to rethink back to first principles how to run the company. Google doesn't run like Apple in the slightest, but they're both interesting, meaningful companies. And so I think a lot of times you get caught up with how do we act like a professional management team or how do we act like an establishment company? I think the most interesting companies don't do that. The most interesting companies think about, well, who are we and how will we be successful in that context? What do we need to add to be different than who we are now? And then ultimately we involve millions. Millions and millions of nodes and millions of people. And we try to help have everybody like a political movement feel like we needed them to be successful. And I think that's the key, I think, to a lot of community projects, which is you have to be successful enough that people can see promise, but fragile enough that they think they need that you need their help. And the example I'll show my political in is just briefly. In 2008, I made phone calls for the Obama campaign. I called a bunch of people on election day in Western Pennsylvania, which was illuminating. And I told them they should get out to vote. And I did it because I thought it was a thing worth doing and I thought Obama might not win if I didn't go call. And that sounds ridiculous, but I think that's the key. I think nobody wants to go join a thing where they don't need you. And so you need to have a project that has promise, but still needs you. I think that's central. So Mozilla was a pretty happy accident for me. And then about two years ago, this month, I joined a firm called Greylock Partners. And I'll do just a quick version. Greylock's one of the oldest VC firms for a billion dollar fund. We're on our 13th fund now. There's eight of us who are active investors. We've all operated six of us have founded companies. Two people have founded one of them founded a company while he's at Greylock. It's called Workday, which one of the most successful IPOs this year. Another one founded it before he got to Greylock called LinkedIn, which is a pretty meaningful company too. And so we all have operated at scale, which means, you know, we've all been around very, very special ramps, very, very special companies. And so we all are able to help. We all love product, but we all have the sense to leave things alone when they're working. And really have the entrepreneurs, the genius the entrepreneur blow it out. But I think we can all help when they struggle. Software only, enterprise software, consumer internet, all stages, I think I've written a 50,000 art check and a 30 million dollar check. That presents its own challenges. It's a big, a big spectrum of things you're able to do. This is who we are. I mean over the past 24 months, we've had a ton of exits. And the exits are interesting, but it's all worked and my partners did, you know, five, 10 years ago in the downturn. I think the more interesting work is the one and two percent companies are doing the garage now, who will show up on this chart when I'm back in a few years maybe. This mostly will look like any other VC will put up, but I'll give some color on it for a second in a second. Great products, great teams. And when I say get all the way to the finish line, what I mean is you're not looking for recognition, you're looking for a, make a big, fundamental, durable company. And there just aren't very many of those, and I'll illustrate that in just a second. And then we kind of obsess about distribution. Probably more than any other firm, we're focused on distribution. Because whether it's enterprise software consumer, the key is how do you get enough people to give a damn about your product and use it? That's a simple question and a really brutally hard question to answer. So we care about distribution and I'll highlight that in a second. So very large, very durable companies. So just to be getting the internet, give or take the web 1995, so maybe 17 years ago, how many consumer internet companies, which is where I focus, do you suppose they're on the public markets that are worth more than a billion dollars? Do you think it's 50 or 100 or 10 or anybody have any guesses? 50. 50. It's more than 10, but it's not for many more than 10. The answer is 24. So, but if you really parse this out, 24 is not a very big number. 15 years, 24 companies. And so, because, like, look, I'll show you my calendar a second. So I meet about 300 to 400 companies every year. And what I'm telling you is that one and a half companies a year between 1995 and now are worth more than a billion dollars on the public markets. That's crazy because I don't even see most of the companies. I see some fraction of consumer internet companies at 350, 400 companies. So here are the 24. It's kind of interesting. I actually don't know what Vista print does. Like, you know, Ann says, what's that? Is this good? No, thank you. You know, we're lucky to be involved in some of them. So how many of these do you think are worth more than 10 billion dollars? Because every firm will tell you they want to invest in multi-billion dollar companies. They're rice counting. It's not half. Seven. That's it. So this list, I submit. So this is the consumer internet, not the other things. The enterprise, which has a number of companies, there's little companies like Apple and others that are pretty big on the hardware side. But this is the seven consumer internet companies that are 10 billion or more public market cap independent companies now. So it's worth looking at those and understanding what's special about them and understanding what's similar and what's different. From our point of view, everyone except for maybe price line, maybe Yahoo, you get serious network defects, serious distribution advantages as you get bigger and bigger to scale. We tend to be obsessed with things that have in baked in network advantages because it lets you get big quickly and lets you be robust for a long time. eBay. I mean, eBay's gone through so many challenges. Yahoo, too, but they're built in distribution effects. They've kept them alive for a long time and now they're both in a period of re-imension. So let me give you a brief aside of virality, which is probably the most overused term that I hear. Most people say, well, our product is totally viral. What they mean is, people are going to love their products so much, they're going to talk about it to their friends. For us, that's not viral. For us, the specific and actual definition of viral is it's useful for me to get all of you on the system because that makes me want to go turn all of you into users. So photo sharing is something that was photo taking on the iPhone. So you first got your camera, photo taking wasn't viral in any way, it wasn't network effect, you'd take your picture, then it'd sell in your hard drive. What Instagram did, what Kevin and Mikey did, is they created a system where for me to get value, I had to turn all of you guys into Instagram users. That's viral and that's a special kind of network characteristic. Anything else is basically word-of-mouth, maybe network effects, but virality is a really special thing and the thing I like about this definition, which came from read, is it's really actionable. It really starts to get you to think. It's like, oh, I'm using this in a single player mode, I'm thinking about this as a one-person product. But now, how do I think about it if I want to use it with my wife or my dad or my cousin or my classmate? That's a really powerful way to unlock on the consumer internet, this idea of network effects, network spread. So here's the bottom line, that everybody's going to tell you they want to invest in the multi-billion dollar companies. And I guess I should say, too, that venture capital is not all the same. It's very different funds, different things. For us, and maybe a handful of others, what we look for is the Facebook style returns, the LinkedIn style returns, big, big, durable companies that are going to be fundamental in landscape changing. What that means is, as a matter of course, you make a lot of mistakes because it's your appearance through a glass darkly. But this is what we try to do. It almost never happens. 24 times on the consumer internet in the last 15 years. And there's a few more that got bought like Instagram and YouTube, but in a few more on the sidelines like Square and some others that are looking pretty good. But when you do it, you change everything. So my profile, some quick observations about VC life. This is my heat map of my calendar from 2012. And so the red days are days when I had eight or more meetings. And the orange days are days when I had five or six, so kind of lighter days. And then the yellow days maybe had two or three meetings. And the other reason June looks like that is because my wife and I had our second child, so I try to take fewer meetings that month. In truth, I didn't take any meetings. I was probably like going to the gym and stuff like that. So here's the thing. I didn't really understand this when I was an entrepreneur. And so I'm trying to communicate to as many people as I can. Venture capitalist, all they do all day is they try to find the best entrepreneurs they can and they try to respond to as many entrepreneurs as they can. The best one is try to be helpful and add value. What that means is you might, a lot of VCs will see 400, 300 companies a year. And most VCs invest in two or three companies a year. That's 1%. I mean, do you say 99 times? Do you say, no, no, you're not for me. Which as a maker, it's a hard thing to do. As a guy who comes in, like, what you're doing is everybody's coming in and they're pitching you what the future is going to be. They can see it. It's already finished for them. The best entrepreneurs can see the future. And what you're doing is you say, okay, like I get this, I get that you see, can see the future. It's just not for me. And so sometimes it's a very hard thing because sometimes you're saying because you don't believe it. Sometimes you're saying it so you don't like it. Sometimes you're saying it for any variety of reasons. But saying 99 knows for every one yes, that's a tough ratio. It's useful to understand it. Contest switching is brutal. So you can have, like, even in just the consumer internet, this is why we specialize a little bit. You might see a photo sharing app and a, you know, you could see a lot of photo sharing apps. But you'll see a lot of different things in the course of just one day. And you'll probably be helping your portfolio companies at the same time. And you'll be trying to think about how to help your partners and everything. So it's a lot of context switching. And as a result, time is everything. So since you're only doing one or two new companies a year, it really is key. Like, you might just be busy. So, you know, we passed on Tumblr on Pinterest twice in 2011. The first time we did it, because we just didn't think it was going to get big, which turned out to be not true. In the second time we did it, it was just hard for us to run after it, because I was in the middle of finishing up investment in Tumblr. So Tumblr was kind of related and we couldn't really pay attention to it. And so, you know, it went by in a way that we couldn't really, I couldn't really aggressively pursue. So timing really, really is everything. And then here's the thing that I think nobody really kind of internalizes. Like, we're all super, super quirky and super idiosyncratic, just like any other collection of humans. So every firm's different, every person's different. And you really have to understand who the person is that you're talking to. Not all I want to pitch Excel or Greylock or Sequoia. So very, very idiosyncratic. We all make decisions differently. We all prosecute things differently. We all think about things differently. This is what happened in my first 24 months. I've done five investments. Citrus Lane, e-commerce for moms, ClearSlide. We're trying to sort of a business app. We're trying to kill WebEx for salespeople. Tumblr Dropbox and Instagram, you probably know. You know, one thing, this worth mentioning, Citrus Lane was a Mayfield fellow named Mariah Finley. He started that company, CS major and master's student. ClearSlide was a guy named Al Lieb, who's a computer scientist from Stanford, who started EVI. Now he's the CEO. Tumblr was a guy named David Carp, who dropped out of high school in ninth grade in New York and taught himself how to code. Dropbox is Drew, MIT computer scientist, and Instagram is Kevin and Mikey, Symbolic Systems majors from Stanford. So I like makers. I like people who are passionate about product, who make things, who really are desperate to build things that people love. And for me, that's been most fruitful. It's been a look in places, engineering school is design schools. That's where I hunt more often than not. And it's not to say you can't be like that as an MBA. A lot of MBAs get tweaked when I say that. I think anybody can be a great product person, as long as you have the passion and the ability to follow up in the details on product and make them great. So that's my first 24 months. So we'll see. Instagram is slightly funky investment, because we wired the money on Thursday and Kevin sent me mail on Sunday. So they were getting acquired. That was unusual. So here's the future. I'll give you three charts and then we'll open up for questions. This is the whole thing. This is where I spend all my day thinking about. This is the internet. In the past five years, it's grown a lot. So almost doubled. And it's useful and instructive to see where it's growing. I think most of the many of the interesting communication apps like Lion and Cacao were seeing come out of Asia. North America is pretty well saturated. I think and hope is a citizen of the earth that we're going to see more and more growth at a Latin American Africa. This is pretty meaningful. This is a bit of an eye chart. But what it is is between 1975 and 2011. Oh, by the way, this is Asimco. Asimco, you should all read this blog. He's going to read a conference today, but he writes some of the most thoughtful stuff about how devices are proliferating in the world. Everybody should read it. What this says is in a logarithmic scale, thousands of units per year between 1975 and 2011, what do we ship? And so what you can see is like, well, here's a TRS80, which again, I guess I'm an old guy. So TRS80, I remember. Here's the next. Steve wasn't always successful. Here's the Commodore 64, which is awesome. The Mac and Taj that you let yellow line, the PCs, this big line. But what I want you to notice is this period here, nothing was happening. The PC and the Mac, I'll show it to you in a better way in just a minute. But now everything's happening. We're seeing a Cambrian explosion of devices and screens and sensors, everything's in play right now. The other way I'll show it to you is this way. So this chart I call the Dark Ages of Computing. So the blue is Windows. So from 1987 till recently, Windows dominated. So as I was putting this together yesterday, I'm like, man, this is what I'm going to look like, the Dark Ages. It looked like we fell off the map. Innovation stopped. It was dominated by just Microsoft. And the snarky part of me says, innovation at Microsoft and that period is probably an oxymoron. But it wasn't a good time. You had this little bit of Mac and Taj, but Mac and Taj wasn't a very good time either. We were going to get bought for the amount of cash we had, right? This sucked. It sucked, sucked, sucked. But now it doesn't. So this is 2011 and it's getting better. So now you've got, I read to me the other day, that for the first time in probably 20 years, more than 50% of emails were read, not without look. And it's because it's on your phone. It's because it's in your tablets and phone and on your TVs. This is going to change everything. For the first time, we've got this incredibly high energy explosion. I think things are in chaos. So the question to you guys is there's white space. So we don't know yet whether we'll go into this dark ages where one of these dominates for another 20 years. I hope not. And I kind of don't think so because I think that the amount of our lives, we are mediating through mobile, through computing generally, is getting higher and higher and higher. So my views were exiting the dark ages. Everything's in chaos. Everything is a promise. There's going to be a bunch of funny starts. There's going to be a bunch of things that they grow and get big and disappear off the face of the earth. Just like the Cambrian explosion, pre-Cambrian explosion or like the Renaissance. We'll have lots and lots and lots of ideas. And this is the time we're living in now. So the question for you guys is what will you put there? And I think this is the essence of entrepreneurship, which is like, well, I see that map. I see how it sucked before, but I'm going to draw it my way now. And so I'll tell you that's the most exciting chart in the whole time that I've been in and around computing. So I'm going to do recap, three simple rules, make things. You'll make a lot of mistakes. The more you make, the more you'll get right. Find your tribe, choose to work with people you care about, and you can live with and you want to collaborate for a long time. And then do what makes you so sing. And then I'm going to give one good. So I'm going to give a gratuitous Jim Harbock picture of wearing Stanford gear. So the thing I like about Harbock, he's a little nutty. But I like him better. This is my favorite Harbock picture because it was after the USC game where we may have gone for two when we were at a USC by maybe 30 points. And Pete Carroll goes, what's your deal? And Jim Harbock goes, what's your deal? And then they run off field. Anyway, so I like Tarbaugh. But he's got this thing that he took the 49ers from his family. And he asked people, who's got it better than us? And so I would just say, you guys all sitting here at Stanford. At Stanford, it a place where the computer science department's strong where you've got many, many, not just one or two entrepreneurship professors, but people running whole programs. The university run by an entrepreneur and an engineer in the middle of capital, mentors, entrepreneurs, companies. There's nobody that's got better than you people do now. And so I would just say that there's nobody that's in a better position to change the world now than there's ever been really. So I think with that, I think we'll go to Q&A and then we'll go from there. Is that okay? Thank you. So, questions? Sure. Your list of 24 had what I think might be your first-market companies. And one, not all the list that you've identified, Skype, one of the early voids. Oh, yeah. That's correct. And when I look at them, is where they're first-market challenges that kept them up for this or the management issues or funding outfades? Oh, so the question is, well, there are a bunch of first-market companies that show up and disappear. And I guess I don't know. I haven't done any analysis on why that happened. One thing that's worth mentioning is that, well, we did a Mozilla was attacking an incumbent market, which was pretty static at a time. And that's a different thing than what say Instagram did, which was on a mobile. You've got green feel and you're trying to go as fast as you can. So it's pretty important to understand the field that you're playing on and you're right that you look back historically. What I did was mostly illustrator say, look, building a company is hard. And so- Recruiting after probably is sort of point on that. Yeah, once you get big, once you get public recruiting gets brutal. And I think that's true now that it's been ever. Next question? Sure. You mentioned that you invest only from one of every hundred companies that you see. So what I was thinking is that it might create some mindset in you that you might become very negative towards investments. So do you use any tools or are there some things that you've stated before you get into a meeting so you don't fall into that trap or be overall negative? Yeah. So the question is, if you say no 99 times, doesn't that make you a little bit negative? And isn't that created a jaded or cynicism trap? And I think that's true. I'll tell you, when you say no 99 times, it doesn't mean you're not interested in 99 of the meetings. So almost every meeting is interesting. Almost every meeting you can learn something from. And I think every meeting, somebody is sacrificing much of their lives to make this feature that they can see true. And so I think it's our job not to be jaded. And I think that if you get jaded too much and if you find yourself there, you sort of shake yourself and try to get better. And if you can't shake yourself in it, you shouldn't do investing anymore as my view. So I'm the new guy. I'm two years into this. I'm not jaded yet. And I'll tell you that you have one meeting with an entrepreneur in a year that turns into an awesome working relationship the last for years or decades. That's enough. Next question? Sure. Okay. What's the biggest reason that you turn down people? Do you look more at the potential in the idea or is it the potential in the person? The question is, what's the reason I turn down companies, I guess? Is it the lack of potential in the idea or lack of potential in the person? And I don't know. Look, after an hour meeting, I don't know anything about you really. And that's one of the things you got to understand as a VC is like you're doing lots and lots and lots of one hour meetings. And you're not doing very in-depth things. So what you're trying to figure out is people you're interested in learning more about over time. I would say there are bars that you have to get over in terms of market size, distribution characteristics, product quality, demonstration that the person knows how to make things. And then I think you just try to figure out whether it's the one for you or not. Like a lot of things I turned down just because it's not, it doesn't resonate with me. I think they'll do really well, it just doesn't, it's not for me. The ones, I think it's easier to say why you like things. When you say I'm going to invest, it's because you believe in the person and you believe in the market and you believe in the product. And when those two things come together, that's the key. So it's easier to say what the positive characteristics are than the negative for me. Sure. Why did you choose to become a VC? Looking back at being an engineer, CEO, and entrepreneur, what do you think you like most? So the question is why did I decide to be a VC? Sorry. And then, which I meant to answer in the presentation, then the second question was which job I liked the most or what role? I decided to be a VC because I thought I could be good at it. And I thought I would like it. That seems like kind of obvious, right? I thought I could like it because I could be good at it. Fundamentally, I've had a really good time building ventures and building management teams. Scaling Mozilla was probably the most fun thing I've ever done. I like working with great people and great entrepreneurs. And it's not more complicated than that. This felt like something that I could be really good at and have a really good time at. As far as roles, I don't know. I think my own journey is I've always tried to find things that I could be world class at. So I've always tried to find things that I could make the biggest difference in the world and be, I don't know, one of the top 5, 10, 20 people in the world at it, which I'm clearly not as a VC, I'm new. And when I came out of Stanford, I was an HCI. Well, when I was undergrad, I was a programmer. And I realized really quickly that I could never be a world class programmer. And I could find other people to be programmers, but I wanted to be a designer. So I wouldn't be a designer. It was really clear, really fast, that I was not ever going to be a world class designer. I could be good at it. I would never be a top 20 designer in the world. But I thought I could be that for organization. And so when I came out of Stanford, I started managing a group of trilogy and I started managing people at Apple and started my own company. And I felt that organizationally, I feel some components at. And I say that kind of in a specific way, because I really feel like, as soon as you feel like you know things, like you start to be kind of stupid. And I feel like organizations and ventures and particulars are learning process that's continual. So everything's new. So I don't know. You know, I'm two years into this job. So tell me it takes a few years to figure out what to do, what your style is, and it's a few years after that to figure out whether your style is any good or not. I like to make it shorter than that, so that's what I'm trying to work on. But I don't know. I like all the jobs I have, and they're all frustrating too. You know? Can you comment on work like balance and your experience of working with women's CEOs and how they navigate it? That's your question. This feels like a complex question. So the question is, can I comment on work life balance, but it seems to be like the question you're actually answering is asking is the other part about women's CEOs and the challenges and how they've navigated. So how do I answer this? There are not enough women entrepreneurs. There are not enough women's CEOs. There are not enough women executives. There are not enough women scientists. There are not women in the workplace generally. I think it's a brutal problem. I think that it starts very early, but I think that's not the only problem. I think that the expectations are on families and caregiving is also another problem. We're going, I have a seven-year-old son, but also a six-month-old son. I look at my wife who's had to take a pause from the workplace because we've prioritized that work for her now. I think challenging. Challenging no way around it. I found it. I'm a Mariahs board. Mariah is a citrus lane. She's got two small kids and she's amazing. She works really hard and she really prioritizes her family. I couldn't quite tell you how she does that. I'm also on the boards of two nonprofits that have female leaders, Mitchell Baker, Mozilla and Jen Palca. It code for America. And they're incredible. Just full-stop incredible. So I don't know how to answer that except that we need more. We need more people thinking about it. It is a hard problem that I don't know how to solve at a micro level other than to just keep trying. Other questions? I said, fine. How will you define sports entrepreneurship and what do you think about the stroll in the merging markets? I want to find social entrepreneurship and how do I think about its role in emerging markets. I think entrepreneurship, full-stop is like having a view of how the world needs to be or will be and then making it happen that way. Social entrepreneurship, I think in my view, is like how do you do that in a way that creates a social outcome as a top line, as opposed to an economic outcome as a top line. This is what we did in Mozilla. The goal was not to make a lot of money. The goal was to make the internet open in a way in a time we thought it was not. Code for America is to make citizenship better and to help more of us be citizens. I think that we're going to see more and more of these because the internet's driving down costs to start. Technology costs and the cost to find people who are like-minded and have a similar vision of the world to you, it's going to almost a zero. You get, or it's just like Kiva and Code for America and others. Distribution costs are almost a zero now too. The thing I'm obsessed with is how do you fund social enterprises or not-for-profit enterprises? How do you fund them in the market? Which is why I'm so proud of what we did in Mozilla, which is we used search and some other things to fund this nonprofit mission. I think that's totally possible because you're driving costs to zero. I don't know much about the emerging developing world to be honest with you. We did a lot of work there and we had a lot of adoption with Firefox and Latin America and Africa. I don't know. I think we're probably going to learn some things about how people deploy wireless networks and how people live their lives on mobile phones from developing nations pretty quickly. So I guess I'm hopeful. The basic equation though is driving costs down to zero to start these things. Then you can start, which means you don't need as much sort of voracious growth to run the things over time. Other question? Sure. When I saw on the slide about how do you see a mention that there's a lot of context switches? So how do you stake it up there through all those context switches? Yeah. The question is, how do I stake productive through context switches? And shit, I don't know. I find it depends on the day. Some days are better than others. And I'll tell you, when I was an operating executive, I would come home and my wife would ask me what I did and I'd say, well, we did this and this and this and this amazing thing. And she asked me what I did now. And most days, I have to look at my calendar. Say, I'm not sure. Because the 8 a.m. meeting was eight contexts ago. And so it's a tough challenge. So I think that the thing that I struggle with the most and the thing that I find other interesting investors struggle with the most is like, how do you do that? How do you, number one, how do you live in your outbox more than your inbox? So how do you decide, like an entrepreneur, how do you decide what the effect you want the world to be? And how do you decide what the interesting things are and how do you go after them as opposed to being reactive to everybody else who wants your time? But the trick is like, how do you do that and still remain accessible and responsive to many, many people who want your help? So I would tell you that I think everybody good struggles with this. And I don't have a good answer yet. Sure. My question is just about how you said you want to find your tribe. And what I was wondering is, is how you go about figuring out what types of people those are for you personally? And when you do find them, how do you know that they're the people that you want to be around and continue to build their relationship? Yeah, that's a good question. I didn't anticipate. So how do you find your tribe and how you figure out who's in and who you want to be around and if it's worth it? I don't know. Coming to Stanford was a pretty good start. And one of the more and buffets got this quote, I think that it's like what you try to find people to work with is people who have integrity, energy, and intelligence because if they don't have the first one, the other two will kill you. And so it's like without integrity, intelligence and energy will totally screw you up, right? And so there's some baseline thing. You just have to figure out where your integrity line is and all this stuff and what fundamental values are important to you. Beyond that, I think you got to try hard to put yourself in a situation that are hard. And I haven't ever given this talk, but I've got a title for a talk I want to give some time, which is called on the virtues of getting your ass kicked. And what I'll tell you is that I've got my ass kicked so many times. And when I got to Stanford, I was going to be a physics major until I got like a C plus in physics 63, right? And it was so clear that I was not able to cope with those guys. When I was a CS-198, the thing I'd say was the most important decision I ever made. Well, they turned me down the first quarter I applied. They turned me down the first quarter and then I applied to be the coordinator. They turned me down the first two quarters. And then the third time I applied, I got to be a coordinator. The first time I looked to be a VC, I didn't really find the right thing. The first time I started a company, I didn't really find the right thing. You know, I've got partners read who go from thing to thing and success to success. That's never been my experience. And I don't know. I think that if you are really aggressive and try to put yourself into hard situations where the people around you kick your ass all the time. So being at a table in our partnership, it's a murder's role. So people invested in creative, the biggest SaaS companies in the world, the biggest networking companies in the world, Facebook, so billions of dollars in returns. And I'm the new guy with five investments and we'll see how it goes. It's an intimidating table to sit at. And then it's intimidating to say things. You do the best you can. And then people say, well, that's kind of the dumbest thing I've heard all day. And you know, nobody's, it's clear. Nobody at Graylux ever said that to me, although I'm pretty sure they thought it. But the, you know, if it's only the dumbest thing today, that's fine. Because then you'll learn and you'll get better. So that's what I would say. It's just like, be clear on your integrity and then put yourself in a situation that are hard, hard, hard. Sure. So your white space chart looks a lot like the banking system. Where it's not been disrupted so long, long, long time. And I just want to give you all the disrupting banking and what's open value can do to as you look at the on-screen. So the question is the chart, the, the, the, the dominant chart looks a lot like the banking industry, which is not kind of disrupted at all. You know, how do I think about the banking industry and opportunities there? And I don't know. Like Instagram Dropbox Tumblr, that's my kind of thing. How do you tell stories to each other? The banking industry, I'm interested in because I think that, but I think every, every system we use is about to get blown up. I mean, you think about how different, like five or six years ago, like we weren't using YouTube every day, we weren't using Facebook every day, we didn't have phones, we didn't get, you know, when you're out and about and your seven year old son asks what the difference between Kit Fisto and, you know, Cad Bain is and Clone Wars, like you didn't have an iPhone to pull out and like look it up on Google, right? And now I know what's in between every Pokemon card ever. So I would say that everything's changed so quickly, but I think we're still at the very, very, very beginning. So I would just say every system that doesn't look like a native mobile real-time system, it's all going to get busted up. There's opportunity everywhere. So I don't have very good banking answers in that. My partner Reed probably would, given his experience at PayPal. But things are hard, banking's hard, but it'll, it'll blow up. Sure, one more question. I was just wondering, I'll say my mom, buddy, mom, already an entrepreneur. How would I approach you and, I mean, not you, just a bench cat rule. And what does the, I mean, is it a gut feeling that you're investing in, you hear, hear me out, say, taking hours or so. At the end of the day, you said it's something that has to collect the vision, the long-term vision, plus you said it was distribution. At the end of the day, something has to collect the gut or the power to the brain. Two questions, then. One is how do you approach, and this best way to approach is by somebody who I've worked with. Every VC responds best to people they've worked with. And it's not, it's not a big, it's not a big test to figure out who's in my network now and the day I've linked in on Facebook. That's the best way to come in. Or, you know, to, to meet some of these things, but in general, it's through it, through it, through it, personally, we know. And the other thing is about how do you know whether it's brain or gut. And I guess a question, a story I forgot to tell, now I'll tell this, and we'll finish up. Is the reason I decided to join Mozilla is I got invited to a meeting with the founders at Yahoo, where we were meeting Jerry Yang. And it was an hour long meeting and Jerry shows up 45 minutes late. We were kind of totally out of thumbs with some of the people who worked for them. And he starts, in 2005, he starts to yell at us. Yel, yell, yell, because he was so pissed that Yahoo users would download far from Fox and become Google users. You're so angry. And I, before that meeting, I was kind of on the fence where whether to join Mozilla or not. But it was in the middle of while he was yelling at us. And look, I don't know Jerry at all. I mean, he's yelling me a couple of times. But, and I'm, he's supposed to be a very, very nice guy. And I guess he probably bought one of these billion or something. But the, but it was while he was yelling at us. I said, well, if you can get a billionaire to yell, to yell at you, you're probably going to pretty good, you're probably nosing around a pretty good space. So that's, that's the key. Like you're trying to figure out whether you love the product, whether you're going to get people to yell at you because it's a, it's a good big space. And whether there's a, a bit of a, a passionate chemistry and, like anything else. Okay. Thank you very much.
