 You were listening to the DFJ entrepreneurial thought leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Today we have a special guest, we have Ed Katnill from Pixar, so he's the president of Pixar and also the president of Dixie Dixie. I knew that. Disney Animation, Dixie's a little different company. What we're here today is to talk about a book. But Disney does use a lot of cups. Disney does use a lot of cups, they do. I would imagine to talk about his new book, Creativity Incorporated. Just to give just a little by way of introduction and also to give a plug, I just said this to Tina Sealy who's sitting over there somewhere. I really do think this is the most useful and interesting creativity book I've ever read. Note that I wrote one, so I'm putting it ahead of one of my books. The reason it's so interesting, in addition to the fact that it's very well done and Ed and I were just talking about the very compulsive process by which he and his editors went through to make a great book. He's just kind of no matching Ed's sort of life in his path, which we're going to talk about. Of course, Pixar. And then on top of that, he leaves together all these sort of ideas about things that you can do to build a more innovative and creative company. So that's what we're going to talk about and use Pixar as the background. Just one little comment that I thought was sort of amusing. I was lucky to be one of among 40 people who were given an early version of the book to read and give comments. And this is sort of a hint, I think, Ed's personality and style is that so having being sort of like a management person, I've read and commented on a lot of business books, especially once by successful senior executives. And after reading the first draft, I guess this is the second draft, one of my comments to Ed was not enough narcissism, which I didn't think was ever possible. And what I meant was I didn't want him to be more of an egomaniac was I wanted to hear more about how he was feeling and thinking and what his reasoning was. And then just having spent the last couple of days rereading the book again, I think he really has done a magnificent job of bringing in his perspective without real narcissism. It's just your perspective. So without further ado, let's start getting to questions. So in rereading the book, one of the things that still strikes me is that as a young boy you were sort of fascinated with Disney films. But then you did this weird thing, you went off and went in another direction and got a PhD in computer science. Ed did an amazing thing, this hand, was that your dissertation? No, it was a class project. It was a class project to describe what the hand was. Well, by chance I happened to be at the Foundation School for Computer Graphics. And I took a class and everybody was supposed to make something and there's some software they had. Now this time everything was made out of polygons or quadric services. And that was it. And they didn't show enough promise. And so I thought what I would do is digitize my left hand. I made a plaster, a pair of smold of it. And I learned later that you should either shave your hand or put the Vaseline on the back. And then I carefully digitized this and then I made a little movie of it. And it was shown at the computer graph, excuse me, the ACM conference because there was no cigarette at that time back in 1972. And it was only those of us who actually ignored the existing software and wrote our own that stayed in computer graphics. So to me, I think that story started diagnosing and maybe we could talk a little bit more about that. The next thing I wanted to get to is this amazing experience you had at the New York Institute of Technology. So there's sort of your boyhood dream of being sort of a graphics person and then you kind of move into computer science. So maybe you could talk a little bit about how you thought about bringing those things together and how that's sort of affected what happened subsequently. Well for the, I grew up in the 50s. So my parents, I didn't know this at the time because we were just growing up to say, from neighborhood, it was only years later, look back and thought, oh, they just went through depression and World War II. And now we were in this bubble of the 50s and the two iconic figures at that time were what there's me and Albert Einstein. So I wanted to be an animator and I watched Walt every Sunday night and explained things and I read about it and I did a lot of drawing. He was fairly good at drawing. And I liked math and physics and when I got out of high school, I realized that I had no idea what the path was to get to be an animator because there were no school for it. So I switched over into physics and I got my undergraduate degree in physics and I got a second undergraduate degree in computer science where I was going to study computer languages at the time. But I returned to school and this is during the height of the Vietnam War so it was important to be in school. My draft number was 30. That may not, it probably doesn't mean much to people nowadays but it meant an awful lot then. And I was at this great school and when I took this course, I recognized that the art and the technology side could come together and while the images were very crude at the time and there was no way you could say this could go on any entertainment thing, there was the potential there. So I worked on solving problems of trying to make it so that the images looked good enough to go into a feature film and when I got my doctor's degree, I went out with the goal of creating the first computer I made a film. And my prediction at the time was that it would take 10 years for us to solve the problems. I was wrong. It took 20. So you're optimistic. So in between, one of the most amazing stories in the books to me is you got this job offer from this guy at the New York Institute of Technology and this guy and maybe you can talk with the guy's name Alex Sherr. And Alex Sherr. And so one of my favorite part to read this in the book is that his word salad, so he would say things like our vision will speed up time eventually deleting it, things like this. So this guy apparently was quite a character. So once you describe a little bit about this early attempt to solve this problem, sort of amazing. Well, it was really cool for me just coming out with this vision was here was a man who ran this college on Long Island and he wanted to be the New Walt Disney. Now he never said he wanted to be the Walt Disney. What he said every day was he didn't want to be the New Walt Disney. But he was willing to fund it. And at that time I was in charge of this brand new lab and hiring people and Alvere Smith who graduated from here was actually my second hire there. And it was this amazing opportunity and there was a man that was willing to fund it. But at that time I did not want to be a manager. So I had some theories about how to manage so that I could get some really good smart people in there and how them be so highly self motivated that I wouldn't need to manage him and I could do my interesting work. And so five years later I was hired away by George Lucas and we had actually a pretty great group and had made a lot of right decisions. I remember at the time looking back thinking okay when I came here I had some ideas about how to manage and one third of them were an absolute clock. They just were bad ideas or naive and two thirds of them actually were pretty good. And I felt going forward into Lucasfilm now where there was this incredible opportunity that the ratio would probably be the same. The reason I say like one third, two thirds because most people have heard the 80-20 rule in 90-10 rule. And actually I think the problem is those kind of delude you because they make you think you're better than you are. I think you're better off saying you know I'm probably wrong more than I think I am. So let me look forward. Let's talk a little bit about the Lucas Day's next. And then onto a Steve Buying Pixar. But one thing that really struck me, we were just talking about a minute ago, was how open you were. So you did a whole bunch of things that almost sound like a modern open source to sort of build the knowledge around making computer animated films. So how did you come to that decision and how did it help and the like? Because we look how close and how paranoid the companies are, including one Steve Jobs founded, for example, but it's sort of an interesting decision that entrepreneurs, a lot of entrepreneurs in the group would have to make whether to be open or whether to be close. Well I came out of the University environment which is very open. So I was inspired by that and I would say it was at the time I knew it was an extraordinary environment and the way that we share things with each other. So it not came out with this idea of making a film and I wasn't the only one around who wanted to do that. And I was aware because it was actually a really small field. We're talking about a handful of people here and they wanted to get there first. They're very competitive with their ideas and so they did not want to share their discoveries. And at this time, SIGGRAPH, the computer graphics community, was brand new. What my belief at the time was that we were so far away from what we needed that the ideas that were current today would get completely bypassed. So we published everything and the rationale was that if we publish everything we're more likely to attract the best people. So we began to accumulate people that not only shared in the vision but they were very good because they liked the idea of sharing. We were rewarded because we only get these people but we were participating in a bigger community. And today most of my friends are still in this community. And I really highly value them. We get together all the time. And Steve never actually tried to prevent us from doing it. Even when Steve was there, we always publish and to this day we still do. In fact the last couple of years the papers coming out of Disney and Pixar have been the single biggest block of papers in many institutions. So you've maintained that openness despite jobs, infamous sort of secrecy at Apple. He was okay with you operating. He never applied it to us. He said, you do it my way. So let's move on and talk. So you mentioned you got hired by George Lucas when he was sort of at the height of early star wars fame. Tell us a little bit about what you learned and what happened in the early days with Lucas. And then tell us about how you almost got bought by General Motors which is I think sort of an interesting plot twist. Really surprised me when I read it. So George had just made Star Wars in 1977 and he was working on a second film in the power strikes back. And he was going to take a big risk with it because as you know it ends with a cliffhanger. He believed that the technology of the time is one of the things that helped Star Wars stand apart. I mean he obviously believes in the story but he had the best people working with optomechanics which he needed for doing blue screen matting and those kinds of things. So he was the only person in the industry that was willing to fund bringing high technology into film. So we hired me to bring in expertise in digital audio, video editing and computer graphics. So we then got together and I had learned something about managers. I got somebody over each group and instead of trying to have a flat structure. I got Andy Moore who came here from Stanford and Alvi went in the graphics and Ralph Guggenheim over video editing and we just start plowing head with full support from George and it was exciting. It was rewarding. We were also off to the side that as well they had these really good filmmakers there. It was clear to me that what we were doing was completely and utterly irrelevant to what they were doing. But it's George's money and he spent it the way he wanted. So that was kind of the attitude. So we're off to the side visually doing things there and... So you had two pretty good early sugar daddy's actually if you look back. Pretty good. Well that was actually... I count Arpa, not called DARPA, as a person. And Arpa's way of running at that time I thought it was enlightened. I think they went downhill after that and I think they're back on a better track. But they're funding of students across the United States with very low bureaucracy I believed was brilliant. And at the time I knew it was great. That's right I loved the model. And then there was Alex Schorer's a sugar daddy but he knew nothing about filmmaking. And then there was George Lucas who had just made Star Wars and then of course the next two were phenomenal successes. So it was an amazing adventure with exciting people and all these... So it was great until it wasn't, right? Well in this case George and his wife got separated and George wanted to maintain the control of the company so she got the cash and he got the company. And so they were then cash poor. And at that time it was the decision was made to sell us. We had built some hardware that we had designed. So we were going to use that as a basis for the business. And we brought in VCs and we put together a fairly difficult deal to sell. But in the end it was Phillips Medical and General Motors who came through and were willing to buy the company for... To give $15 million to George and give $15 million to us to get us going. And it was within one week of signing when within General Motors the EDS part, the Ross Pearl holdovers and the cars people got into a war with each other and it brought all the deals to a halt and so ours fell apart. But you were very close. But what this was is so they were to film company, you were selling a piece of computer hardware, right? Yes, what was it? What's called the Pixar image computer? It was made to composite images together but it was 4K resolution film, so a very high resolution, really fast for that. But it turns out that it was also very good for image processing. So we had, as it started the company, a lot of orders from three-letter agencies around Washington, D.C. where the box would be delivered and we'd never hear from them again. And then in the medical industry where we did the first volume imaging and then we entered into a contract with Disney to color the cells. So that hardware we built and we had to learn how to manufacture. So when Steve bought us, I'm now the president, I know nothing about being the president of the company. I don't know anything about manufacturing or sales or marketing. There wasn't anybody in the group that did. So why did Steve buy you guys? That's not exactly endorsement the last couple of seconds. Well, no, no, actually, I mean, I know. The thing was Steve had worked with consumer products before but he never worked with a high end product so he had no instinct for the marketing, pricing, selling or manufacturing of high end product. So basically none of us were. But when he bought you, was he buying a computer, a hardware company or was he buying a movie company, I guess, it's sort of the question, what did he think he was buying? Well, we were still years away from it even being practical. Okay. So he was buying the people. Okay. Now what happened was after he, we first met him when he was Apple, then he disappeared for some strange reason. And then he, which we learn about a month later. And then he reappeared and he wanted to buy us to use the foundation for this new computer company. So we declined. So then he went and got the new computer company was next. Yeah. Well, he then went and got some people. Okay. And that then became next. Okay. And after he formed next, I ran into him as a graph which by coincidence was in San Francisco. So we walked the floor and he still wanted to buy us as a group. But now it was to be what we wanted to be. So we then ended in negotiations which itself was an interesting long story. We won't go there. But it resulted in him acquiring us from. So so far, I don't see much sign of an organizational strategy. Are you somebody believes this is a side, but it's really do you believe in organizational strategy after going through? Because we haven't gotten to the story about how Pixar, Emerge from Kim, a film company. Like what's your view of a sort of long term planning and organizational strategy? Well, at the time I didn't, I mean, other than the fact that you know I was reading a lot of books to try to figure it out, but I couldn't actually connect with them. It's like surfing. You got to be at the right place to cast the wave. Well, I was never at the right place. So you were just tumbling around there in the ocean. But in terms of strategy, you know, we, in one sense you could say yes, we had a business plan and we didn't so forth. But I believe and I'd say this is very early on is that for all the planning, it's like when the reality hits, I'm going to adapt the reality. So those plans quickly went out the window for a variety of reasons, either because we had miscalled it or we didn't know what we were doing. It was just a variety of reasons there. But in all case, we're, we kept rethinking and trying to adapt to what was there. So you were, they call it sort of improvisation, our colleague on Cathy Eisenhardt always talks about how a lot of times that you improvise and respond to what's in front of you and the plan goes out the window constantly. So let's talk a little bit about the early, you're still doing that. Talk about sort of the early days. What did you do before you became a film company? Because there's a, how many years from the time that Steve bought you to the point where you were sure you were a film company? Because that went on for a while. He acquired us in, in 86, beginning of 86. And we entered into our contract with Disney to make Toy Story in 91. Okay. All right. So that's basically, it was five years. And in the five years, we had to go from nothing to hiring the people, figuring out manufacturing, which was an intense and very educational experience in a surprising way to me. And I learned something about which was just affected my outlook. But we weren't big enough to keep creating new hardware to actually keep up with the wave that was happening in the whole industry as a whole. And so our business plan basically did not work and then we had to figure out how to gracefully get out without screwing our customers. Our customers was Disney. And I'm looking at this saying, okay, while we're kind of doing okay here, I mean, we're a little underwater, so that's kind of okay, it's not all about okay. But you can see where it was going. It was going more underwater. So how do we get out from this? And so a guy called me and who's running some of the company, who's acquiring all of the image processing companies, figured that if you got all the different products and can sell it into one company, you'd have a sustainable business. So he called up and said, you'd be willing to sell your hardware business. And I said, well, let me think about it, click. Yes! So call it back the next day and say, yeah, we will do this. And so we sold it for a million dollars. And the thing was, I knew that they would never pay the million dollars. And the reason we did it was they would keep manufacturing the box for Disney while we were rewriting the software to go on to Silicon Graphics box. All right. And it turns out they did fine. They lost it for several years. But ultimately, which we knew, they were doomed. But it's... So that's an argument for selling something for nothing and it's still the right thing to do, it's sort of an interesting thing. Yeah, we were trying to protect them. And Steve was okay with that. Because I mean, the book was... And Steve tried to sell the... By the way, Steve tried to sell the company to Microsoft and Silicon Graphics sort of in between. Yeah, and Alias there. So, oh yeah. So that was... It was a very unusual time. First of all, we were losing a lot of money. And so by the time we were... We had done with this, Steve was $54 million in the whole. So that puts us in an unusual circumstance because you logically was saying... And this was before Steve Jobs was really rich. This was like a substantial portion of his net worth at that time, as I understand it. Yeah, I think the biography said he was worth $100 million at the time, which I don't think was true. I think it was probably double that, but he never said. But $54 million out of anyone on him is a significant chunk. So it was very difficult for him. And so he would sell, but what he would do when he would try to sell, like to Microsoft, he would... He asked for this number, which is outrageously high, and they came back with a really big number, but it wasn't the number he asked for. So I'm thinking, well, it's over with. I know it's too big of a whole first Steve. So they will compromise in the middle. Steve wouldn't compromise. And this happened three times. So I finally realized he's actually not trying to sell us. He's trying to validate whether or not we're worth something. And as soon as somebody says they're worth something, well, he's not going to let them have us. So we've done the heart of business. We started selling software. We started making commercials. And because of our... One, we had maintained a superb relationship with Disney through all this. And because we had one awards with the shorts, because we're John directed these shorts, and we're making very good commercials, that we were in a situation where Disney now having these 40 marketable films thought there was a big appetite for animation. So they took a gamble on Nightmare Before Christmas. And they thought, well, that's kind of idiosyncratic. Computer graphics is probably just as weird as a stop motion, but we'll take a gamble on it. And the term they used, it was boutique animation. So we ended into a contract in 1991 to make that story. For a story. And that was your first... So when you were talking a little bit about what you learned and what happened during the making of the first toy story, because I hear a little bit about that. And then one thing that's sort of interesting that I'd forgotten until just today when I was rereading it, that Steve decided to do the IPO before the movie didn't came out. Was that correct? Yes. So sort of amazing. So you still had made no money at all? Yeah, yeah. We made no money. So this isn't the way it's supposed to work. They tell me in your venture capital classes. So it's sort of an amazing story. So and this is where Steve was showing his brilliance. Now, around this time, next is kind of not working out so well. And I've got a good relationship with Steve, but on all of the stuff, but we didn't want him there full time. He was really good part time. Because he faced Howard, and he let us, excuse me, I keep reigning. Yeah. It's from the table, we'll be fine. So we're out trying to figure out how to make this movie. And we were a group though that had been through failures together. So we'd all experienced that. And it was really difficult to figure this out. We made a lot of misestimates, and the first versions didn't work very well. As we got closer, it became apparent that we were onto something really big. Now I have to say, John Lasseter, I believe, right from the minute that this is going to be gigantic. But from Disney's point of view, it was a boutique film. So they didn't put any consumer products behind it, because they didn't see it being anything. But as we got into the last year, it was now apparent it was big. And so Steve said, OK, now we are going to revolutionize this industry. But we're also in a position where, because we've got the experience here, not only do we have the first film out, we will probably have the second film out before anybody else can get into this. But the deal that we had with Disney, frankly, was not a very good deal. We got like three to five percent of the profit or something like that. So it was not very good. So Steve called John and me together and he said, OK, our deal lasts for three pictures. And at the end, we're on our own. Michael Eisner will realize as soon as this film is successful that he will have just created his biggest nightmare. So he will not want the contract to end. So when the film comes out, he will renegotiate. And when we renegotiate, I want 50 percent of the profits. But if we get 50 percent of the profits, that means we have to put up 50 percent of the money. So in order for us to put a 50 percent of the money, we have to have the money in the bank. Therefore, we should go public. So John are saying, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This is a little early here. Let's prove our worth first, but Steve being Steve had a compelling way about him. So we put on the road show. We went out and showed pieces of the movie. But what he told people, as we went on the road show, so I went out with our CFO went with us, Lawrence Lee and Steve. And as we went out, the argument was that the company will go public one week after the movie opens. So you will see that we're changing the industry. And so that's the prep. So the movie comes out. It opens huge. It gets incredible reviews. And then the next week we go public. And it was the biggest IPO of the year. It was bigger than Netscape. Incredible. It was an incredible thing. So since you mentioned Steve, at some point we should get this. One of my favorite parts of the book is in the book at various time touches. So you work with Steve 26 years, you said. And there's also a chapter at the end that's specifically about Steve. One of my favorite parts was you describe how you basically learned how to argue with him without going crazy. So I thought that was quite interesting. Maybe you could describe a little bit about how your relationship evolved and how you learned to... Yeah. So as we started with Steve, Steve had a reputation, which everybody knows because it's part of the public. I mean, I think people talk a lot about it. And I want to... Later, address some of that. But I did ask Steve to begin with. I said, so what happens or how do you work if somebody doesn't agree with you? And he said, well, I just explain it to them until they understand. So I go back to my colleagues and explain this and they all have this nervous laugh. Now, the thing you should understand is, in all the 26 years of Steve, Steve and I never had one of these loud verbal arguments. And it's not in my nature to do that. So I never actually had an argument to see. But we did disagree fairly frequently about things. And the way it worked was I discovered was that I would say something to him and he would immediately shoot it down because he could think faster than I could. So we end the conversation and I would then wait a week and usually, the user is on the telephone. I'd call him up and I'd give my counter argument to what he had said. I'd need to immediately shoot it down. So I'd wait another week. Sometimes this went on for months. But in the end, one of three things happened. About a third of the time he said, oh, I get it. You're right. And that was the end of it. And there was another third of the time in which he'd say, you know, actually, I think he is right. The other third of the time where we didn't reach consensus, he just let me do it my way. Never say anything more about it. So that worked out. But it's pretty interesting because I mean, I was really struck with ad and I don't think we'll have a lot of time to talk about it at the end. But also, you have an argument that especially later in his life, he sort of was misunderstood in terms of just the negativity part glossed over the fact that he got more mature and emotionally sensitive with age. Yeah, for me, it was an important thing is that you heard about Steve and those early days and things and the way he interacted with people. And I was there for that and saw about as it applied in our particular environment. And I saw a lot of cases where Steve overreached or like he would go for a home run and he would get the home run like he would lose the game. And what people didn't understand is Steve was so incredibly smart that he was learning from those mistakes. He was learning that certain kinds of overreaching get in the way. And by the time we got to dealing with Disney, he was going for a 50-50 partnership. The way he delivered hard news changed with people and he became an empathetic person. And again, there were difficult decisions and the way Steve delivered the news changed dramatically. Basically, most of the people who saw this change in Steve then stayed with him for the rest of his life. So that arc in Steve is unreported. And the reason it's missed is when reporters or anybody that's going to write about Steve calls to ask us, well, Steve is still alive. I'm not going to say I kind of lie, Steve, to a person I don't know. And none of these people would. So the change in Steve, which to me was very dramatic, is not publicly known. And so that's well described in the last sort of the addendum to the book or whatever. So we've got about 10 minutes before we open up to question. What I'd like to do now is we've sort of talked a lot about what it took to sort of get to Pixar kind of through the first film and not in the IPO. But a lot of the book, and to me some of those interesting parts of the book are the way that Pixar operates as a routinely creative organization. So maybe there's a couple of different topics you could discuss. One is, once you talk a little bit about the brain trust, because to me, that's a fascinating part of the film. And think a little bit about how that might apply to other kinds of organizations too. Well, the brain trust is something we happened on accidentally. John was the director, and he had four people around him who were very focused and funny and really driven, and they were passionate about the film itself. So they would have intense discussions, but it was never personal. And they basically went through three films together. And this was so successful that as other people were coming up, we would add them to this thing and then understand and start to call it the brain trust. So there was something about having colleagues giving notes to each other that worked really well. So we tried to apply the principle to other groups, like with our technical groups and others, and we found that it didn't work as well. So then we had to go back and look at it and say, okay, what's actually going on here that's making this group work better than just a collection of smart people, which is for a lot of people, brain trust means, oh, you get your smart people together and you room you discuss it. So that's not what I mean. So one of the things we realized is that the brain trust had no authority. They could not tell the director what to do. So when somebody else was directing, and now John is a member of it, he could not tell him what to do. I couldn't tell him what to do. Steve couldn't tell him what to do. And the consequence of that is that the director, the person responsible, was not coming into the room in a defensive posture knowing that this group could screw him over. So it changed the dynamics. But then we had to pay attention to a lot of elements of the dynamics because in our case, we need a lot of deep candor about what works and what doesn't work. And what we found in this true most places is there are good reasons why most people hold back and they don't say what they think. They don't want to embarrass themselves. They don't want to embarrass other people. They want to look good in front of other people. They might want to grandstand. They're all sorts of personal, emotional reasons that get in the way frequently. And most of them, I should admit that they're there. So our view was that as the managers was not to actually examine the idea at the time. It was to sit back and examine the dynamics of the room because if the dynamics were working, they're going to solve the problem. So rather than me get caught up in the problem, I wanted to look and say, okay, that's the same with they think. And the result is we've got this group which on the whole has done completely remarkable things. It doesn't work. It doesn't work. It collapses. And every once in a while, magic happens. But by setting that up and paying attention to it, we've got something where on the whole it does, it's how the remarkable body of work. So one of the things I do when I teach is I actually show a little film that Brad Bird actually told me about first, it's the extra material of the Incredibles and it's his team fighting over various things and really constructive conflict. And when I show it to executive audiences, which I do all the time, they say that's great at our organization that would never work. So you have any, can it actually work someplace other than Pixar? Okay. So, I know where I have time here. Here's the, I have a lot of views about a very things from failure and risk and so forth and which I believe very strongly in. I can read the book if they want to read more. But with all that theory, I was also very aware that I am also suddenly to delusion just as other people can be or are. So we could be successful for reasons that we don't see because we're all together and we don't fully acknowledge what somebody contributes. But eight years ago, Disney came in and bought Pixar. And at that time, they asked John and me to run Disney Animation. So we made the decision that we were going to keep these two studios completely separate. That is, they're not allowed to do any production work for each other whatsoever. So now we had a group that was failing and demoralized and led poorly. So there were these great films of the 90s, basically it was four. They were cultural changing, Little Mermaid allowed and being the beast and then Lion King. And then it went downhill. So we walk in and basically the process people have taken over. And since process is important, they're thinking about how to lower costs and get everything running smoothly and so forth. And they can, I mean, bad film after bad film. So for us, it's like, well, often you actually get to take your principles and apply them to an entirely different group of people. And I knew almost nobody there. So we determined to turn them around. So we work with them. We taught the principles. It took a while. The fact is all the stuff sounds good. But like a lot of things, it's sound good. They depend upon trust and trust is something that takes a while to earn. And usually what it means is you have to go through some screw ups together and some failures in mess ups and then still be there for each other. And when you're there for each other, then you begin to trust each other and then begin to apply the principles. Now they've made six films since we've been there. All six have been critical successes. And we dramatically altered everything from top to bottom and the way they thought about it and the principles and the philosophy. And then finally they had the big commercial success which was Tangled, which is the biggest film since Lion King. Then Record Ralph was a big success and then Frozen just became the highest grossing animated film in history. So here's the key thing. It's largely the same people who were there when they were failing. And the things that couldn't do in terms of being honest or candid with each other or figuring out how they thought about problems and failures. Like those same people learned those things and they altered their behavior. They are a different group of people together. And it's actually an amazing and gratifying to go through. And the other thing is it has, because they kept them separate, like nobody could say, they couldn't say Pixar rescue them. And likewise, did they bail out Pixar because we kept them separate. But they evolved into having very different personalities. The brain trust, they just have a completely different mindset. They're both extraordinary. Like the best groups that I know of and they're very different from each other. So the brain trust is, as I recall from the book, there's a brain trust. And you pulled out the people who actually knew nothing about making films, for example. That was one of the kind of changes you make as I remember. Yeah, when you got there, they had, above the director, they had three levels of people who were giving mandatory notes. None of them would ever made a film before. So that's the first thing to go. You're the director, okay, you don't listen to any of their notes. You don't have to take our notes either. And that was rather shocking thing for them. But we had to go through some training. So what we did was we brought them up to watch a Pixar session, but we didn't allow them to say anything. It's kind of strange, really. It was actually very effective. So the next day, we all went down and looked at a Disney movie, and our brain trust is there watching, and they didn't say anything. But the brain trust, according to the producer, gave the best notes they had ever given. That is just seeing how it worked altered their behavior. So there's a thousand things in the book. About two or three minutes, I want to do a quick one. I'm going to do a quick one that I want to ask you, the Tina Ceele question. So the quick one is my favorite chapter. I especially recommend it's got this kind of weird name, the hungry beast and the ugly baby. So just to give us a little taste, can you give us just a minute or two of what you mean by the hungry beast and the ugly baby? Because I think it's essential for managing innovation. Okay, so it's a term I heard used at Disney, but it's used in other industries also. And that is the bulk of your people are working on your products. It's a creative, active thing. And it's where the group that generates your revenue, but it's also where your costs are. So I don't mean it's the hungry beast in a derogatory sense, but it's like it's this beast that's got to be fed, or think like the news or newspapers, right? You've got to feed this thing. So up front, we have to generate new ideas. What happens a lot of companies is after the founders go away or move on or get hit by cars or whatever happens to founders. Then the most organized people are the ones who run the beast. So they put those people over the whole thing. And they bring the values to the upfront process, which is okay, let's go on schedule, let's get this, because we've got to feed this beast here. Our issue, and I think this is true in most places, is the very nature of what we're doing at the front. It's fundamentally different than we're running the beast. We're doing something which is unknown. We're in wild territory. We don't know what's going to happen. And what we first do, or if I think of movies, people think making the movie sounds exciting. And it is exciting, but there's an imagination of what it must be like. It's sort of like having this beautiful baby, and the baby grows up to be this beautiful movie star. But what do you do if the baby is ugly? And that is our reality. Is that the new ideas are fragile. They don't look good. They take protection. You cannot judge them at that point. You can see how well the team is working together, but you can't judge the ideas. Now, so we have to go from that stage to somehow with engagement with that beast. And this is a long process. But the normal thing that happens is people screw up the front end. Now the Tina's sealant question, and then get your questions ready. So Tina, where's Tina? That's our somewhere. Anyhow, she's way in the back. Tina wrote a great book. What I wish I knew when I was 20, so I'm going to ask you the Tina's sealant question. So if you could go back to your 20s, you had quite a bit of experience. I think you saw your early management sort of jobs. What advice would you give yourself that you wish you knew then? OK, so this is, and I was asked this by a 20 year old, and this road trip here. And I hadn't been asking before. So here's the difficult I've got. Is I've seen so many people who, income is at various stages. They believe they need to know what's right, and they can't listen to the advice. So a lot of you have heard of the term cognitive bias. Confirmation bias. Confirmation bias. It's confirmation bias. I think confirmation bias actually is not strong enough of an implication of what it is. Most of us have filters which take the words that we hear and frequently turn them into the opposite of what they mean. It's not even selecting. It actually is warping them into something which is wrong. So then the question is, OK, could I have said anything to myself at 20 years, when I was 20 years, that would have made a difference? And honest to God, I don't know. Because I sometimes talk with people and I tell them things there. And actually even with the book, I go through some examples in the book of things which are important. And I'll say, here's something. But the train of thought is that that thing which I thought was powerful. I later learned meant nothing. OK, so one of them is like story is king. Like in our business, story is king. And we believe that. We gave it to, or we said it. But then I realized that every studio said that whether or not they were producing works of art or complete other pieces of draft. All right, so the phrase didn't actually have any meaning. So my logic is going to go to the next stage after that. But what I found was on a lot of the websites, people would refer to that as, oh, thank goodness you said that because that's really what I believe. And kind of missing the deeper point is that sometimes those things that are true don't actually alter our behavior. And that's why I find it really hard to say, what would I say to myself? When I have the opportunity to talk to some people and I find that some get it and some don't. So the question is, am I this sort of person who would have gotten it? Or maybe listen. Well, what to give some subtitles and then we'll get to the questions. Randy Commissar, actually in ETL a few years ago you can find the video. Basically made the argument that it's that is great is it would be to learn from other people's failures. They just don't have the same emotional impact you got to have your own failures to really move forward. Which is I think it's sort of part of what you're saying actually. Well, it is. Other than having lived this, I don't know what to do. But I do believe that along the way because of the mentors and people I worked with, there was a view about mistakes and failure and trying things which did inform me. And having that philosophical view about how the world changes, how what interdependence actually means, and the full implication of that, as well as, and this would be devised to like the first conclusions are almost always wrong. And so are the second and the third. And to this day we're still finding things that we had concluded long ago actually are incorrect. In some cases they were incorrect then and we didn't realize it because we had overcome it because of other means. In some cases they were correct then and they are not long correct. Okay, so we've got 10 minutes. We should move to questions. Lots of hands here. So yes, I guess I should repeat them because you guys are going to have, so yes, talk loud. So in addition to creating these fantastic movies, I infer from the book that you've established this remarkable cycle in which rapid advances in technology enable these new creative works that then feedback to accelerate the advances in technology, computer graphics in this case. And I'm curious whether it's getting any cheaper to establish cycles like this between new technologies and new kinds of creative works or whether it's actually just more and more expensive now. Well, I basically probably more expensive. But the one thing to note about that is that the underlying technical base that is the hardware continues to change, the underlying software base to changing and our expert expertise level on the workflow is changing. There is nothing stable about it. And the reason you want to think about this loop between the artistic and the technical which I think it applies in a lot of areas is a mechanism to deal through the instability of that. And that instability is where we want to be. All right, someone else. I'll go in the back. Yeah, I like the back. Yeah. Can you speak a little bit about the values between the art and the technology of Pixar? Can you talk more about the potential of the art and the technology of the art and the technology of the art? Well, the issue of showcasing the science would actually never be a point of conflict between the two. For me, the issue is, and I know this is true with a lot of companies because companies now are all realized and they have to involve technology. But for most people, they're trying to bring it in. A lot of them, they don't do it very successfully. And for me, the model is that you know you're an integrated company if you can't draw a line between the technical and the creative. Okay. All right. And I would say in Pixar and Disney is there is no line between the two. So that kind of conflict actually, if you were to talk about that within that, that particular comment wouldn't make any sense. There are people who are pure technical and people who are pure artists, but then they span this range. But whatever we work on, and there are certain disagreements about a variety of things, but it would never be about showcasing technology over the art. Okay. Somebody, right there. And another talk you mentioned that something really important is that while an organizational hierarchy might be necessary, it's good to avoid a communication hierarchy. One of the tricky things about this is, you know, even if I'm in the middle room at Pixar and I know I could email you, that doesn't necessarily mean that I will. So I'm curious to know what other manifestations there are, what other effects are crew after you've established that there's no communication hierarchy. Well, okay. So we say this to all new employees. Now, the fact is, because of people's emotional responses, then I know full well that there are certain things that I won't say or they won't say things to me. And I also know that a manager that says some level in the company has got objectives and goals, and when you're in tight budget or schedule, which is sort of the reality of our lives at all times, then you will give off body language, which is that don't do anything to disrupt it. So while this is a principle to strive for, there are deep, human personal emotions which get in the way all the time. So the reason we're talking about this is not to say, oh, what you're going to have is a structure-free information thing. That ain't going to happen. But it means that you want that because you need the truth to come from anywhere and to be able to come out of order. So that means that you are continually, you've got a sycophine, is that what you say? I can't say it. The sycophine is a task of continually rolling this up there because there are always the tendencies to go back and to have the communication follow the organizational structure. So the trick is to realize it's always going on even if you're doing a pretty good job of rooting it out. It keeps creeping back in. That's an endless job. All right. Let's see. We're on the way in the back with a hand. Yeah. Thank you. What do you think is the best about what we do is that what best is has we learned about the Internet? Well, the... I mean, teamwork is one of the things everybody says, well, it's good to work in teams. So I want to go beyond the obvious is to say that what we learn to look for is just whether or not that magic is happening in the team. Like when the team is clicking together. And so we go through phases. Like you put a group together. It's good to have some people who have already worked together. If they've all worked together before, then actually you've got a closed group, which is an opening. If there are too many new people there, they may go over the rails. So you actually want to balance if new people coming in. That's your upfront risk is how much new versus experience do you have within a group. Then you have to work things out there. And sometimes the groups click and they move along quite well. But a lot of times there are problems. And now you've got this problem. If there are problems, do people immediately raise their hands and have a problem? Well, it's kind of the responsibility for the group to work things out. And they feel like it's going out of school to go immediately up the ladder to say there's a problem here. But in the other hand, sometimes there are problems that will think it. So you've got this fuzzy thing where problems should be worked out in the group, but sometimes they're not. So what you need are people who are candid, have enough experience to say, I want to raise a flag. So it's not blowing a whistle. It's not calling it a halt. It's just saying, I think this isn't working as well as it should. So you get a couple flags and say, okay, let's try some tweaking. So we will do tweaking. And most of the time the tweaking, which sometimes is adding a person or taking a person out, is enough for the team to click in the place. Sometimes that doesn't work. And then we have massive failures and restarts. So we span the range there. But the only time we know is on work is when you actually feel that team working together. I'll wait to the right. Yeah. Can you see this industry in next five to ten years? Well, since our films take five or six years to make, then the five year parts, the easier one. We even have them scheduled out. But when I talk about the stability of it, obviously, the mechanisms for distribution are changing. There are three different kinds of long format storytelling. There's obviously some very good long form television. There's the live action model for making films. And then there's the model that we use at Disney at Pixar. And we're embedded in an industry which is both changing the way we deliver. And because it's going global means that there is a, we're bringing in connections with the other parts of Disney in the outside world. So it is trying to make the storytelling work. So that's the changing part. The thing that still is the same is the storytelling is not just entertainment. It is the way we communicate with each other. The way we talk with our children, we read to them, we tell stories, we read stories in the newspaper. We've got articles, books, storytelling. It is our way of teaching and talking with each other. So that's always going to be there, even though some of the form will change. So we're trying to be flexible enough to adapt to the things that are happening. But believe we have a model based upon the way we as humans act. And last question. Yeah, right here. At Pixar in particular, where do you enjoy spending most of your time in the management sector or in the creative, more of the storytelling and the animation and everything that goes along with that? Or the technical research development, like the open sub-divs and all the projects there. Where do you find yourself enjoying the most? Well, the first thing to know is for me managing is a creative act. And I define creativity to be very broad. It isn't just what some people think in terms of the artistic side. That it is problem-solving. And that our central problem is to try to remove barriers to that. And in addressing the barriers and the blocks and things that get in the way, then one has to think about the human nature that we've got and our differences and things that happen in other people that are very difficult for me to discern. And I find that very fascinating. So that takes most of my time. So early in my career, I was very technically focused. And now I'm very focused on what I think is a complex, difficult problem. And it is how we address these hidden problems to get in our way of problem-solving. So we're at the end. Just a sort of closing comment. I think in Ed's answers, you're seeing that you don't get glib management consultant or PR person responses. He thinks very deeply about the stuff that he does. Much more deeply, frankly, than most business people are consulting people I know. And that's one reason that I found the book so fascinating from the very beginning. And it really does reflect the sort of deep thought that you've seen from Ed here. So thank you so much for joining us, Ed. And thank you everybody for joining us. Thank you. Thank you very much.
