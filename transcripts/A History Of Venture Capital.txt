 You are listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Today we have an awesome guest, Spencer Ante. Spencer comes to us from Business Week where he's an editor. He's had a terrific career in journalism already. He's worked at the street.com, which I'd love to hear any Jim Kramer stories if you have them. Wired, the New York Times among many other publications that he's written for. Spencer's latest book, or his current book, that caused us to invite him to Stanford, was Creative Capital. And so the story of George Dorey and the Birth of Venture Capital as an industry. Spencer's going to talk a little bit about his book and his research. And we probably should acknowledge or admit in advance that you actually went to Cal at one point in your career. So in advance we forgive you. So please help me welcome Spencer to Stanford. Thanks Michael. It's great to be at Stanford. I'm honored and really thrilled to be here because I think Stanford over the last 20 years has really become the world's pre-minute university for innovation. Or what I would call entrepreneurial science and technology. You think about all the great companies that have come out of Stanford in the last few decades. Cisco, Yahoo, Google, to name a few of the more prominent ones. Most of you know that probably because that's probably one of the reasons why you wanted to come to school here. So I'm pleased to be speaking here because of the connections also between Stanford and the guy I wrote about in my book, George Doreo. Doreo in a sense pioneered the entrepreneurial economy. That's why I wanted to write this book was because I felt that he was this leader or the profit of the start of nation that we all live in today. And in a sense he handed the ball off to the West Coast. And that entrepreneurial economy obviously was taken to new heights and new levels in Silicon Valley. So in fact, the last part of my book, I chronicle the rise of Silicon Valley. And the instrumental role that Frederick Turman, who some of you may know, was a legendary Stanford professor and provost, who was really like the key player in the creation of Silicon Valley. And I think Turman and Doreo were kindred spirits in a lot of ways. And Turman essentially stole the playbook that was pioneered at MIT and adopted it to Northern California. And I think that playbook had one sort of central feature, which was that, you know, creating university. That excels in the sciences and technology and forges a beneficial and close relationship between the academic world and the commercial world. And, you know, I was talking to one Stanford professor recently, Reggie Mawani, and we were talking about this and he said, the way he put it was, the university does not look down on commercial aspirations. And I think he nailed it there. And, you know, I think not only does this benefit the economy, but it also benefits the school because the things that he's picking up on outside of the world. And, you know, he's picking up on outside, he incorporates back into the classroom and it's a sort of osmosis thing that goes on. It's mutually beneficial. So, what is my book about? Some of you may have picked it up. I'm sure most of you haven't. The thesis of the book is that in the second half of the 20th century, the US experienced a profound transformation in which our society was dominated by large corporations such as US steel, standard oil, general motors. It shifted to a nation driven by a more nimble venture capital back, startups such as, you know, digital climate cooperation, Intel, Starbucks, Google, countless others. And the person who led that transformation more than anyone individual, I argue, my book was George Dorio. So, that's why I wrote the book. Dorio had a lot of great little catchphrases that he coined over the years, sort of Nietzschean aphorisms. This is actually one of my more favorite ones. It's a little early in the day to be talking about whiskey, but it's a good advice to keep in mind. You know, in 1946, most people think venture capital was created in the West Coast, but it actually wasn't. It was created on the East Coast and it was created after World War II. And Dorio became the president of American Research and Development Corporation, which was one of the first venture capital firms. It wasn't the only venture capital firm. There were actually a few others. The Rockefellers had a firm, J.H. Whitney. But what distinguished Dorio was that he was the first guy to start raising money from non-family sources. I.E. who was raising money from, you know, more than just wealthy families. And this was really significant because it greatly expanded the amount of capital that entrepreneurs could tap into. And so, in a sense, you know, and I argue, it's a mockertized, a very clubby world, and benefits us all. Of course, there was a lot of skepticism about this back in the day. Now we all tell you for granted. But the famous inventor, Charles Kettering, predicted that ARD would go bust within five years. But Dorio proved him wrong over the next, you know, three decades. ARD financed over a hundred companies on its existence, many of which became huge successes in their fields. Companies nurtured by ARD include digital equipment cooperation. It's the most successful investment. But also a number of other great companies such as Cordis, the medical device maker, and the technology manufacturing company Tyredine. So, I came to see Dorio is, in a sense, the leader of a social movement that, you know, and he exerted his influence through his, not only his venture capital firm, but he was a very public figure. You know, a lot of venture capital firms stay a very private, a very secretive. But Dorio wanted to, you know, he saw the benefits of being more public about what they were doing because he was trying to create a movement of entrepreneurs, not only in the United States, but across the world. And he did this through his writings, his speeches, through the annual meetings of ARD, which was sort of like the first high tech trade shows. He would invite people in the public to come in and they would show off all their companies and, you know, created a lot of interest in the media. And, you know, as one investment banker from Lehman Brothers said, Dorio was very important because he was the first person to believe there's a future in financing entrepreneurs in an organized way. So, you know, most of the people who come to speak here are entrepreneurs or leaders of business. I come here as an author, historian, journalist, and who's covered technology for the last 15 years or so. And so what I want to do is just offer a historical perspective on this entrepreneurial economy and give you a sense for, you know, where this incredible ecosystem comes from, and, you know, maybe more importantly, how we can keep it going for the next 50 years. You know, because I'm sure you guys are picking up on all this. Who's graduating this year? How's the job market? Who's got jobs? Okay. Right. So, this is affecting all of you. As you all clearly well know, there's a lot of fear. There's a lot of uncertainty in our economy. You know, it's the greatest recession since World War II, maybe even since the Great Depression people say, our animal spirits are repressed. We have to find a way to revive them. And, you know, how are we going to do that? You know, there's a cover story in this weekend's New York Times magazine that's basically said Silicon Valley was dead. Or at least I wouldn't be able to create enough jobs to help get us out of the recession. I completely disagree with that. I'm actually, I have a contrarian view. I'm pretty optimistic about what's going on. And I think the Valley will play a cue role in helping us get out of this. And like it always has in the past. And I hope, you know, my remarks explain why. So, one thing I want to do is just give it like a brief reading or two from the book. And then I'm just going to sort of expound on I think the significance of what the themes of the book and how it relates to today. So, a lot of people are talking about the Great Depression today. And so, there's actually a whole chapter on my book on the Great Depression. I just want to read you a brief excerpt from that because I think it really says a lot about what we're going through today. In his 1933 inauguration speech, Franklin Delano Roosevelt famously told the nation, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Thanks to Roosevelt's firm leadership, the US was no longer in the fear of dissolving its revolutionary energy. But although unemployment had declined in the economy, advanced steadily throughout Roosevelt's first two terms, the new deal felt to completely pull the US out of the Depression. The median job was, this is not right, during the new deal was what? And it went to, yes, unemployment rate during the Depression. That was the low point. The median was about 17%. And interestingly, until the United States entered World War II, it never fell below 14%. So, there was really high unemployment throughout the entire Great Depression, you know, despite the new deal. The country was in the grip of fear, but it was fear of a different sort. It was a profound fear to take economic risks. The crash of 29 inflicted deep scars on the psyche of the nation. Scars that were not healed and it's left to the war. For Americans, we were afraid to deposit money in a bank. They were surely in no mood to invest in securities or any other venture that wasn't as solid as Mahan in Bedrock. Despite all the pauses of the new deal, and there were many, Depressionary Tax Policies had the unintended consequence of creating a riskless economy. The string of tax acts and new taxes extinguished the Asian sparks of innovation. The revenue act of 32, one of the largest tax increases in American history, double the estate tax, increased corporate taxes, raised taxes on high incomes. There was another tax act of 35 and another in 37. So, you know, by 1937, this had become a really serious problem. And the investment banker as the whole financial community woke up to it in one conference in 1936, the president of MIT, Carl Compton, said, government regulation has been directed almost entirely at the curbing of exploitation and has generally ignored and sometimes even penalize attempts toward technical progress. The result of this was that more and more money was flowing into conservative investment trusts to insurance companies, pension funds. And by 1938, one professor of finance at NYU remarked, if investors throughout the land, large and small, were feigning from purchasing unseasoned securities of a young industry, and refused to take risk, where will new industries obtain capital, and would not such a development slow down the progress of the country? So, segue into 38 and 39, and there was a bunch of industrials and financiers in New England who, you know, became obsessed with fixing this problem. And they formed a thing called the New England Council, and the purpose of the New England Council was to improve the economic conditions for New England. And so, there was a growing awareness within New England's universities and the research community and the research labs that they were a valuable asset that could set the region apart from the rest of the country. Of course, MIT was the most valuable asset. So, the New England Council met, and they formed this one committee, it's called the New Products Committee. Convened its first meeting to discuss the results of research, one part of the committee concluded that, although capital existed for New Ventures, there was a need for an organization and a technique to appraise opportunities for specific enterprises. George Dureo, who was part of this committee, said the great need is for technical analysis of situations in order that venture capital may proceed with the reasonable delivery of insurance. So, these guys formed this committee and then history through our mentioned their plans. They were all set to finance these companies and on May 10th, Germany invaded Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands. And they all realized that, you know, this is not going to happen. The United States was facing a grave of risk, global fascism. She needed to devote all her energies to fighting the war. Still, the experience of this council and related ventures taught these pioneers a one important lesson, which was, it might not be a good idea to have a company with only a small enough money to find and study projects and then to pass the hat around for more money. A company should have its own capital they concluded. That way, it would be insulated from events outside of its control. So, I just wanted to share that one little thing with you because I just think it shows a few things. One is that the government, you know, can play a big role in either stimulating or repressing innovation. And I think we're seeing that again today. During the depression, obviously, the government, I don't think, did a great job of stimulating entrepreneurship. And to a sense that made sense. They were bigger, fished or fry. They were trying to get the economy back on its feet. And the focus was on bigness, you know, big government agencies, big government funding. And they really overlooked the importance of the small. Now, the war happened and the ironic thing, and one of the things that I concluded in my book that I thought was pre-engined was that, in a sense, World War II delayed the formation of the start-up nation. But in another sense, it was better for it in the long run because what happened during World War II, I argue, was that George Dorio in particular learned how to become a venture capitalist during World War II. And I know some of you might say, well, how does big government learn how to become a venture capitalist? Well, what happened was, is Dorio became a Brigadier General in the American Army. And he was in charge of research and development in the quartermaster core. And the quartermaster core is part of the army that basically provides all the soldiers with the equipment, the gear, everything the soldier wears or takes out into the battlefield is made by the quartermaster. And what Dorio realizes is that, funding a war, our equipment is from World War I, and we need to develop new equipment in order to defeat the Nazis. And so he organized, he had a sort of a radical idea, which was that, let's apply science and technology to war. So he organized a lot of the research labs in America, and he sort of got them to work with them and develop a lot of technologies that, you know, for example, bulletproof armor, flak jackets, that was actually invented by Dorio during World War II because they were trying to figure out a way to protect pilots who were getting all this flak from Nazi gunfire. And, you know, there's dozens and dozens of products that Dorio sort of oversaw the creation of during World War II. And he was like a venture capitalist. He had a couple billion dollars in the government. He brought together scientists and engineers and business people, and they created all these great things that solved the needs of various people. And, you know, end of the war, you know, a lot of people came out of the war, and they were like, the big question was, how do we get the economy going? How do we get the economy to a peacetime economy? Because the entire economy had to be taken over by, you know, the war production machine. So, this is a picture of Dorio. He was actually, he did a lot of things, and he did a lot of things really well. Before he was in the army, he was a professor at Harvard Business School, and they used to call him the doctor of sick businesses because during the depression, he would be get hired by all these companies to become a director or consultant, or even a president. He was the president of a metal company during the Great Depression. And so, that was another key factor that helped him become a venture capitalist because he saw, you know, he lived through, you know, the shitstorm. He lived through the worst depression that our country had ever seen. And so, he learned a lot how to deal with adversity. He learned a lot how to, you know, all the problems that a business could ever see, you would see during the Great Depression. And so, that benefit him enormously after the war because, in a lot of ways, venture capital is just, it's the art of dealing with adversity. It's the art of dealing with problems and solving problems. And, you know, he often said that every single one of the companies that they financed, had a near death experience at least one time. And, you know, and you see that over and over again, venture capital. So, after the war, these people in New England were like, let's revive this idea. We need it more than ever. They came together and they founded American Research and Development. And, you know, their whole idea was get the economy back on its feet and let's try to convince some of these conservative investment companies to give us money. So, they went out and they raised, guess, how much was the first venture capital fund? How much money was raised in the first venture capital fund? Anyone? 5,000? 5,000? It wasn't that small. 5,000 at close. Okay, they tried to raise like 8 million. They ended up raising like 3.5. And, they raised money from Syracuse University, Rice University, MIT, a couple of insurance companies, a couple of endowment. And, you know, and that's really stayed the same. That's where most venture capital companies raised their money from today. Those kinds of institutions. So, there's one other, one or two other things is one interesting passage, as I just want to share with you. And, one of them concerns really, you know, the venture capital business, as you all know, is it's based on home runs. You know, you have like 20 companies in your invest in, you know, 5, 5 or 10 of them, you know, go out of business. Another 5, do okay. Two do pretty well. And, maybe there's one home run. And, it's that one home run that, you know, makes the fund. It makes everyone money and keeps, you know, the sort of virtuous cycle going. And, for Dorio, you know, they figured this out. And, and what I argue, the first venture capital home run, the first home run of the entrepreneurial economy, was happened under American Research Development, and it was digital equipment corporation. And, digital equipment corporation was really, you know, the thing that lit the fire of everyone who was, who was trying to figure out, is this thing going to really work? Well, they put $70,000 into it. And, when it went public later on, it was worth 70,000% more than what they put into it. So, it ended up being worth a couple hundred million dollars for a $70,000 investment. And, that was the first time that anyone had approved, you can make a lot of money investing in these risky companies. You know, just small amounts of money. And, you know, you can just create enormous wealth. So, that was significant. And, I'll just share with you one little passage from that. The annual meetings of ARD were always festive affairs. Over the last 20 years, Dorio had transformed a normally sedate event into a three-ring circus, where entrepreneurs can network, trade ideas, and show off their wares to hundreds of stockholders, friends, and phony members of the press. But, ARD's gathering in 1966 was an unusually raucous occasion. The pressures have been growing on Dorio to address problems of the US Securities and Exchange Commission and to take public its rising-star digital equipment, a Massachusetts startup that spearheaded the market for many computers. The SEC had begun to question a number of ARD's practices, including the issuance of stock auctions to officers, and the seemingly rich valuations that ARD placed on the small private companies that financed. On the meetings first day, Dorio took on the SEC highlighting the rigorous process by which ARD sought to value these young companies. Our valuations, when securities and earners are not traded, are worked out very carefully, he said, with a great desire to give stockholders an idea of trends, but also an obligation not to give false hopes. It was a convincing argument, but one investor did not buy it. Otto Hirschman, who owned a hundred, excuse me, 14,600 shares of ARD stocks stood up and criticized the company's management for the first time in its history. He argued that ARD treated its stockholders unfairly by undervaluing the company and not paying out enough indivitance. A new board of directors should be elected to better represent the interests of all stockholders declared Hirschman. The stocks were the 150 bucks of share he said if we had another board. Had Dorio confided in Hirschman his future plans, the activists and investors probably would have never attacked the ARD board for Dorio was laying the groundwork for a stock offering that would delight Hirschman and other shareholders like no other IPO had done before, digital equipment. In the fall of 65, Dorio had already secured an underwriter on a Chukton, New York, he persuaded Longstreet Hinton, loved that name, and ARD director who was executive vice president of the Morgan Guarantee Trust Company to buy 20% of the offering with his valuable promise, Lehman Brothers President Robert Lehman agreed to take digital public. The task for taking the public fell to a 31 year old junior banker named Arnold Crowell. Quote, no one at Lehman had the slightest interest in doing an offering for a mini computer. No one knew what a mini computer was. There was a prejudice that IBM was the only company that would ever do good. It was a throw away and it was thrown at me. ARD had helped digital and countless ways since its inception. Dorio invested money in digital with no one understood the importance of committing computers. He stocked the board with ARD staffers, helped guide its business, rejected many take over offers for his prococious child, and he himself became the chief mentor of Ken Olson, the company's founder and president. Dorio's orchestration of the IPO was the crowning achievement that perfectly symbolized his philosophy. He believed in building companies for the long haul, not flipping them for a quick profit. In now, nine long years after its first investment in digital, Dorio decided it was time for digital's coming out party. Arnold Crowell, the banker, grabbed the ball, no one wanted it, ran up to the headquarters, burned it into the company. Olson stood in the background and Dorio orchestrated the whole process, articulating the value of the company, to the staff of Lehman Brothers. Crowell recommended the offering, the biggest concern was competition from IBM, but digital exacts and Dorio were convinced that big blue could have moved quickly enough to catch up to digital's innovative banjo engineers. Quote, I came away with the feeling that the company would be able to make its internal projections which were very high. The IPO was green-lighted. As the summer drew to a close, it was time for ARD's sender, well, to put on a grueless slipper on August 19, 1966, Lehman led an $8 million offering to sell digital shares under the ticker DEC. It easily sold out. In nine years, ARD's $70,000 investment had skyrocketed in value by a factor of $500 at that time to $38 million, validating Dorio's vision and improving the short-sightedness of the SEC. But there was no celebration inside of the wool mill that served as digital headquarters. Quote, I don't think anyone viewed it as a way to get rich quick, said Winston-Hendel, a digital exec. It was a quiet sense of enthusiasm and pride. After the IPO, digital offered stock options to a water group of employees, many of them took advantage of that. But the shares got dragged down by the following stock market, bottoming out at about $17 after one public at $22. Quote, some of the people tried to give the options back, said Ted Johnson, people felt they've been had. If you sold, you were an idiot because the stock market recovered. And as digital shares began to rise, more and more people grew intrigued by the fairytale. True analysts realized digital was sitting on the gold mine, the company's PDPA computer sold for $18,000, $1,000 to cost of an IBM mainframe. Market exploded, tens of thousands of machines were sold to labs and industrial companies. By March of 67, digital shares topped 50 bucks over the summer, they went over 80, in September, they cost $100. In October, just as Otto Hirschman had hoped, AirD stock reached a record high of $152. It's stake in digital was now worth $200,000. Digital was the VC's energy's first home run. Quote, I'd say it was a sea change in the attitudes towards venture capital investing, said one idea of the executive. It had really never been phenomenal and during success. For clots like Ken Olsen could do it, why cut an eye? Digital blew up on the restrictions that anyone had ever applied to entrepreneurial ventures. It was really mind-blowing. You could take such a small amount of money and get ownership of a company. That was worth at one time more than IBM, in a fairly short period of time. Dorial was very important, said one investment banker because he was the first one to believe there was a future in financing entrepreneurs in an organized way. I just wanted to show that story because it really symbolizes this guy's philosophy, which I think is starting to come back in Vogue right now. We've had the situation where it was the easy money. Money was so, it was like capital was flowing like crazy. Now capital is one of the scariest resources around and people are desperate to get their hands on it. Some of the lessons I think we can learn from this, it's too late to follow this advice. One of the things that Dorial always said was raise money when you don't need it. Because when you need it, you're at least probable to get it. But think about that during the next downturn because I'm sure there will be another one before your career is over. Another lesson, go big. One of the big insights of Dorial was the riskiest part of the investment spectrum is often the most rewarding, not from just a monetary point of view, but from a psychic income point of view. I'm not saying investors should focus purely on early stage ventures, but I think today many VCs have become too cautious. They're not really venture capitalists. They're like caretakers, they're like pension fund managers in a sense. And I think that's a problem. Another thing which is hard to do in these times, but I think it's important is stay optimistic. Dorial often said one of the assets we have and one of the reasons people want to work with us is because we can cope with adversity. We understand that every good and worthwhile thing in this world is the struggle. One has to learn how to live with problems, accept them as opportunities to handle them more successfully and more competitively than other people would. Be patient, I mentioned that before. This is more important than ever since we're not in the boomerror mentality. Digital took nine years to take public. That's going to become, that is the norm right now actually. It might even become longer. So get used to it. But at the same time, a lot of people think this is a bad thing. I don't necessarily agree with that. If you're building a company for the long haul, if you're building something to value that fulfills the needs and desires of consumers or businesses, you're going to get a payoff. Dorial always said financial returns are the byproduct of hard labor and not the end goal. And I think that's a really big insight. The upside of that of course is if you continue to build a company of value, when the capital markets do open again, your exit's going to be larger. So it's not a zero sum game. It's also why, you know, and you never hear this today, but he referred to companies as his children. Dorial actually didn't have any children himself, so I think he sort of projected some of those desires or parenting on the entrepreneurs that he worked with. Sometimes the entrepreneurs didn't like that. Sometimes they did. But I think it says a lot about how much he cared about these companies. When you have a child, you don't ask what return you can expect from your child. Of course you have hopes. You hope your child become the president of the United States, but that's not very probable. I want these guys and these ladies to do at stand in the well in their field if they do the rewards will come. But if a man is good and loyal, it is not a chief of so-called good or a return. I'm going to stay with him. Some people don't become geniuses until after 24, he said. If I were to speculate the question of return would apply, but I don't consider myself a speculator in my dash of the word constructive. I am building men and companies. Dorial landed on the cover of business week in 1949. Happy to say that our magazine saw the importance of venture capital 50 years ago. This is one of my favorite quotes. He had a big ego, but he was also really humble in a lot of ways. I think this speaks to the humility of him that wherever he worked, whatever he did, when he was in the harbor, when he was in the military, when he was in venture capital, he always bucked the sort of profiling system. During World War II, everyone thought the US army was on the verge of defeating the Nazis. Then the battle of the bulge happened and the war went on for another 12 to 18 months. Dorial knew that was going to happen. He was getting orders from the president Eisenhower, cut back in production. The war is coming to an end. We need to convert the economy to peacetime economy. Dorial fought that. He controlled people. He finnegoed people. He kept the production of shoes and coal with their uniforms and things going. When the battle of the bulge happened, these guys had saved people from dying essentially. People would have gotten frostbite. They would have died. I think that's a really interesting character trait to have. I just want to finish on my talk by talking about more recent history. One of the key questions I ask in my book, and I think this is one of the key questions of everything in the history of the economy. Why did Silicon Valley take over leadership of the technology industry in the 1970s? I'm just going to read one little more brief thing. From that. Today, many financiers and entrepreneurs assume the West Coast always dominated the VC business. They simply don't realize industry was pioneered by ARD and a few other firms in the Northeast. The rise of the West was far from predestined and was not even obvious to the industry's move as the checkers moved in 30 years ago. So why did Silicon Valley take over? Part of the answer I argue is in geography and history. In pre-World War II America, the Northeast enjoyed regional advantage based on its technological and financial superiority. MIT was the top science technology university. Harvard Business School was the leader in business education. New York was obviously the financial capital of the world. So you put all those ingredients together. It gives you a long way towards explaining why the Northeast was the leader in entrepreneurial technology. Also, after World War II, the regional advantage was increased because Boston became the epicenter of military research and development. Other than the Manhattan Project, I would argue MIT around the two most important government research labs in the mid-20th century. One was the radiation lab, which invented radar. The other was the Lincoln lab, founded in 1951, which was funding from DOD. That was the lab that actually gave birth to digital climate cooperation because Ken Olson was an engineer at the Lincoln lab who developed the technology for the computer while working for the government. In the 1960s, the West Coast began to take over the tech industry, a hospitable climate and a greater acceptance of ethnic diversity certainly gave the West an edge in attracting creative talent. Higher education was the key, though. The University of California and California Institute of Technology by then again to reputation for cutting-edge research and science and engineering. Much of the credit for the creation of the value, though, goes to Frederick Turmin, the provost and professor of engineering. So, we had world-class universities. You had a budding commercial track record with companies like Ulyt Packard and Ampac, that were coming out of the value at that time. The region was poised to take over the tech industry. All it needed was what? Money. You need money to get to grow a business. In 1958, William Draper, co-founded Draper Gathre and Anderson, and now he's the first West Coast veteran firm of prominence, but he retired only after eight years. Then another person you probably heard of Arthur Rock, set up his own firm in 1961. They did great. They made a lot of money. But, you know, they dissolved their partnership. One of the great things they did was found intel. And it's a funny story that says rock. I got a call from Robert Nois one day in 1968. He said, gee, maybe Gordon and I want to leave Fairchild Semekindacter and go into a business for ourselves. We talked about it for a while. I'll ask them how much money they needed. They said, $2.5 million. Given the sterling reputation of Nois and Gordon and more, Rock was able to easily raise $2.5 million. He also wrote their business plan. People knew Nois, people knew more. They were anxious to invest. But, they dissolved their partnership. So, if the West Coast was going to really take over the VC and tech industry and needed more, a bigger pool of capital venture firms, well, what happened? All these firms started popping up in the late 60s and early 70s. Gid Meyers, part of the Mayfield Fund, co-founded in 1969, said the entire VC community at that time, quote, we meet at the Mark Hopkins Hotel for lunch. It was about 20 people. It was very small. In the early 70s, the movement I argued reached critical mass when all these partnerships sprouted up. Besides Mayfield, there was Sutterhill Ventures. There was institutional venture associates start in 1970. And I would say among all these firms that sprouted up, there were two in particular that distinguished themselves in the PAC. Who were they? I mean, Clienter Perkins, I think, was one of them. They raised their first venture fund. So, the first venture fund was $3.5 million in 1946. How big was Clienter Perkins' first venture fund? 100 million? 15? $8 million. So, you know, it's like 30 years later and they only raised a fund that was like, you know, twice as big as, you know, the first one. So, there's still not a lot of money coming into venture capital. The creation of KP represented the culmination of 20 years of Silicon Valley Evolution, illuminating the importance of the region's deep-rooted networks. Clienter was, Eugene Clienter was an alumnus of Fairchild, which was the mother of all Silicon Valley spin-offs. And Tom Perkins was a HP executive, which was the first tech startup. The second firm, I would argue, is Sequoia Capital. And I actually just came from Sequoia Capital, where I met Mike Morts today, and they're still going strong. Sequoia was founded in 1972 by Don Valentine. It was actually in New Yorker. He was a young, a young person, a graduate of Fordham, caught the California bug, ended up working for numbers, successful firms like Fairchild. Don Valentine said, quote, it was clear to me while I was living in the right part of the world, I never had to cross the Mississippi because of the microposs processor revolution. Sequoia, under Don Valentine, realized the game-changing nature of the micropossessor, and he funded a whole string of companies that capitalized on that. The two most prominent ones were Apple Computer, and Atari, which created the video game industry. And the other interesting thing about Clienter Perkins was that, apart from the micropossessor, there was another revolution that happened during the 1970s. And that was the creation of the biotechnology industry, which really Clienter Perkins deserves quite a four. Quick story about the biotech industry, the first company of importance was actually Genentech. Genentech was an interesting story because it shows you the boldness of the vision that they had, and it also shows you the incredible hurdles that they had to jump over in order to pull this off. So the story goes that Clienter Perkins was on the verge of creating another spectacular industry, one that would prove the value and an importance of VC to the mainstream of America. In 1974, Perkins hired this new guy named Robert Swanson. He was a 27-year-old MIT grad and had an MBA from Sloan School. In his first year with KAP, Swanson handled various deals, none of them worked out well. One deal in particular with a company called CEDIS, Strain Relations with the firm's small staff. They killed that deal. They were trying to convince the guys as CEDIS to tackle the more ambitious challenge of splicing genes, a new frontier of medical technology. CEDIS rejected the idea, feeling that it would take too long before the technology could be perfected. So KAP said, Swanson, we love you, but you got to find a new job. We have nothing for you to do here. CEDIS wants to, their name is on the door. Clienter Perkins, I was clearly very much the junior partner. They said, you can continue to have a desk and a telephone until you find what you're going to do. There was nothing like that to give you motivation. CEDIS wants to, he refused to leave. He wanted to dive headfirst into biotechnology. If he could get something going in the area Perkins told him, I'd back you. I said to myself, this is really important. It wouldn't be wonderful if you could use microorganisms to make genetically modified products. And why can't that be done today, CEDIS? He started cold calling people to learn all he could about the field. One name stuck in his car, Herbert Boyer, a 40-year-old biochemistry biophysics professor at UCSF, who developed an ingenious technique to engineer drugs by splicing DNA from one organism into the genes of another. In 76 of January, Swanson dropped by Boyer's lab and retreated to a nearby bar to hash out their ideas. Boyer told Swanson that the commercialization of the technique would take 10 years of basic research. But Swanson kept pressing him, speed it up. Think of ways to speed it up. Persistence paid off on April 7. They each put $500 into the tail and incorporated genetic. It was a lot of money for Swanson, who was still jobless and surviving on an unemployment check of $410 a month. Quote, my half of an apartment in Pacific Heights was $250. My least payment on the Dots in 240Z was $110. And the rest was peanut butter sandwiches and an occasional movie. Sounds like your life, right? One month later, after Swanson raised some additional money for the company, K.P. invited Boyer to make a presentation. I was very impressed with them, said Perkins. He had thought through the whole thing. The Perkins was unearned by the tremendous risk. He would only go along. They found a way to take out some risk from an adventure, a classic technique pioneered by ARD. Perkins came up with the answer. Genentech would subcontract the initial research, so the company would not have to put a multi-million dollar bill to set up its own laboratory. K.P. bought a 25% stake in Genentech for 100 grand. The investment paid for the proof of concept experiment to synthesize the first gene. Genentech's ultimate goal was to synthesize human insulin, but Boyer and the researchers convinced Swanson start with something simpler. Just a simple hormone. By the fall of 1977, Genentech had hired three institutions to do the research, they figured out how to clone this samosa-tin gene. The accomplishment Able Swanson to raise more money to make insulin. Quote, the day we announced the gene was the headline in San Francisco examiners as Perkins, that woke up the world to what we now call a genetic engineering. In 78, Genentech scientists cloned human insulin. Following the company manufactured human growth hormone in 1980, Genentech held the first IPO of a biotech company and raised 35 million. Stock shut up from $35 to 88 on its first day of trading, one of the biggest one-day pops ever. Quote, biotech technology jumpstarted the public's fascination with a VC set Frederick Frank a former banker at Lemur Brothers and director of the Salk Institute who took public money to this company. Yet cover articles on the new world of molecular biology became an investment of passion. People realize that can not only do well but also help. That's when the public really became involved in VC. The IPO, I argue, was important for one other reason. It cemented the valley's reputation for being the dominant force and technology adventure capital. It's interesting because when you think about the conventional wisdom of the 1970s is what? It was a horrible time for the economy, right? We invented a new term in fact to come up with how bad it was. It was called stagflation. It was a combination of high inflation and deflation. But in my alternative history of the 70s, what I think you find is that there was a recession, there was stagflation. But it laid the groundwork for the boom in the 80s. These radical things that happened during the 70s, the creation of the personal computer, the creation of the video game industry, the creation of biotechnology. All these things were like rocket fuel to the economy in the 1980s. That brings us to today. Like I said, there's a lot of pessimism about what's going on today. It's a quite capital. One of them was successful firms. They had this presentation and I'm sure a lot of you heard about. It's at RIP good times. It was a very depressing message in a lot of ways. But I just talked to Mike and he's actually quite optimistic about things believe or not. Why is that? I think the value is going to continue to remain strong in the service of the economy. If you look at the fundamentals, nothing has really changed. The universities are still the best in the world. We still have the largest bench of entrepreneurial talent in the world. Of course that's changing, but we're still pre-eminent. The VC industry, even though funding and getting harder is capital, still has an enormous amount of money. There's an incredible amount of dry powder out there. 30 or 40 billion dollars, which is more than enough to fund thousands of companies. The newest factor that you can underestimate going back to what I talked about before is the role of government. Government is starting to enact policies that will help revive our animal spirits. Under Obama we're increasing investment in basic research. We're increasing investment in science and technology and infrastructure. Hopefully he'll keep tax as well. We don't know yet, but it looks like it's going to be okay for now. Hopefully he'll avoid protectionist trade measures. That's never good for the economy. I just leave you with one thought, which is that great companies can be built during bad times. You should all be thinking about that right now. It doesn't feel like there's a reason to be optimistic, but you should really think about it in a different way. The most successful investment that Dorio ever made, as I said, digital equipment, that was made during the recession of 1957. There's another recession in 1960 and 1961. That was actually the most active year in ARD's history. They invested in 15 companies that year. I'm hopeful that we'll get our mojo back. We're at the crossroads, not to put a lot of pressure on all of you, but a lot of it's up to you to help bring it back. Hopefully you guys come up with the great ideas and the great technologies. You're going to create these great companies that are, you know, get us back and bring back the good times. Good luck with that and thanks for having me to talk here. I appreciate it. I know we have at least two questions that were pre-arranged in the front row. Are you ready? No, not ready. Any more time? No, still here. We'll have a substitute for you. Yes, sir. I think that it will be there. There's no question that there's a globalization of not only the entire economy, but venture capital is part of that globalization. Like I said, I just talked to Mike Moritz today. He went to China eight times last year. I mean, most people don't go anywhere eight times. Yeah, he went to China eight times last year. A lot of the money is flowing into China, into India, into other emerging markets. One of the great things that George Joyel realized, he said, creative ability knows no boundaries. So it's up to us, the venture capital industry, to seek out that creativity wherever it is and try to capitalize it and to help these emerging nations, you know, become full-fledged members of the global economy. Because it will help us too. It will create markets where it will end up purchasing products from our economy. And I think it will be mutually beneficial for the most part. I asked the folks with questions just to speak up really nice and loud and the venture you would like to be just a question that everybody can hear. You might the remark that most of these things become kind of like engine sound managers. And I would actually argue that the series A is now the background of finance for our company. So given what you've seen in the history of start venture capital, what advice would you give to these days today in coming to the roots of venture capital? So the question is what advice would you give to VCs today to help them return to the roots of venture capital? I think in a lot of ways this is happening already. I think some of the most interesting things going on in the investment world today. I'm focusing on what I would call microcap investing. What is microcap investing? It's basically the idea that you don't need a $500 million fund to be successful. In fact, a lot of the more interesting funds today are raising anywhere from 20 million to 100 million, like first round capital, as an interesting example, they raise $125 million fund. They're doing Steve Stagefield. They're investing $500,000 in companies. And it's smart because the big guys, as you probably know, a lot of the economics of the industry don't work for making investment anymore because they don't move the needle. So that's opening up opportunities for some of these newer guys. And I think to me that's where the innovation is happening. It's funny because it's ironic because venture capital is all about promoting innovation. But in a lot of ways, the venture capital industry is not very innovative in terms of itself. It's kind of like following the same things that have been going on for decades. And now it's like they can't afford to do that anymore. I think the venture capital industry is in a sort of crossroads where they have to reinvent the industry. And I think the microcap thing will be part of that. You mentioned that you think you're $30, $40 billion for right-catters sitting in the ground of venture capital. It sounds like a lot of money, but then when you listen to how much the stimulus package all that is getting involved, it's kind of a lot smaller. I was wondering how much that figure would have been in the same five years ago. The amount of money that's uninvested but raised. It probably wouldn't be that much different. Probably it would be, you know, the venture capital history has been on a steady growth path in terms of the amount of money that's been raised in the last five or six years. But this year obviously, it's the first year that's falling since 2003 or 2002. So I think last year, $30 billion was raised. In this year, I think $27 or $28 billion was raised. But obviously new money is going out the door all the time. So it would probably be another $10 or $15 billion less. But to your point about the stimulus, the stimulus is obviously it's a different animal. I mean, you're talking about giving a shot on the arm to the entire United States economy, which is $13 trillion. So you're going to need a really big number to make that happen. But my basic point though is that in terms of innovation, innovation doesn't require a whole ton of money. It's more about the ideas and the people and the execution. That's more important. Well, do you get the sense that these things, I mean, with this money, the waiting for something to happen, the waiting for the market to do something? I don't know what they're waiting for. I think you know what they're waiting for. They're waiting for things to go back to normal, right? Which I think is a mistake because I don't think when we get out of this, it's not going to be the same. There's going to be a new normal, right? The new normal is not going to be pre-revenue companies doing $3 million around getting $300 million dollar valuations. It just, you know, it doesn't make sense. It never made sense. It only makes sense when there's a glut of capital. And we're not going to have a glut of capital for a long time. So I think a lot of people are waiting for things to return back to normal, but the people that are doing that I think are not going to succeed. Until the rounds of mergers go through, that you're not going to see a lot of capital in market, because if I'm an investment banking firm, I can put up $20 billion and take 7% of that. Why should I open the gate out for some small companies to come through? Because that means that these new assets that I have, these companies that I've worked with to create larger and larger companies, can buy those companies right off. So there's a fundamental tension between the venture capital is getting its money back out, and an investment bank, which would much rather see these, this round of mergers go through. So, you know, it's one IPO last year, and there's not going to be that many this year, and the reason why they're not going to be that many is that gate's closed. So it doesn't matter how hopefully you are at a small company, you get around and you use it up, and the next round is dependent on whether or not you could actually see some exit for that. If those exits aren't there, people are going to be just going in circles. And so there's a fundamental tension with you, I think having addressed there, which is that the sizes of these deals are much larger in the investment banking industry than they are in venture capital industry. And nothing's going to happen until they're finished with that round of mergers. Okay, you make some good points. I definitely agree that the lack of IPO is a huge problem. There's no question about it. But you have to think a little bit more long term. Okay, I mean, the capital markets are not going to remain closed forever. I mean, it's just... It won't be closed forever. Yeah, and... It's going to be opened up until this next round of mergers go through. I don't agree with that, actually. I think there's a lot of factors that will determine whether or not the capital markets are going to open. I think the biggest factor is not M&A. The biggest factor is confidence in the economy. Okay, people right now have no confidence in anything. Because I mean, Microsoft just reported earnings. They're not even giving you guidance on what their earnings are going to be, which they've never done before. They have no visibility into the future. Right? And so until things settle down and people can get some confidence that they know where things are going, you know, the capital markets are going to remain closed. I'm not that confident, it's not a big set of personnel in that transaction. That's a big transaction. It takes me a lot less time to do it. You have confidence you're going to make, but no one wants to buy that transaction. That's my point. The people who... The five industries that raise up 20 million dollars that's fine, and that's a fact. Right, but what I'm saying is that nobody wants to buy IPOs. Right? The public doesn't want to buy them because... That's what I'm saying. Well, that's my point. The reason is that you don't have confidence that small companies can succeed in today's market because of all the issues that they're facing. I mean, even big companies. It's like they're having tons of problems. So you'll write the exit issue is huge, but I think the exit issue is eventually going to solve itself. So you have to keep it in mind, and that people who are thinking long-term will continue to invest in these companies so that when the markets do open up, they're going to be positioned to take advantage of it. So as is usually the case, we have way more great content than we have time. So let's end the session now with a big thank you from bases. Thank you.
