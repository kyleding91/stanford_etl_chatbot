 Who you are defines how you build. This is the Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders Series. Brought to you by Stanford E Corner. Welcome Stanford students and our global audience to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders Series. I'm Luke Sakura, head of content at STBP. And ETL is presented by STBP, the Entrepreneurship Center in Stanford School of Engineering, and bases the Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students. Today we are really thrilled to welcome Juliet Anama and Darius Teeter to ETL. Juliet is the Chairwoman of Junior Nigeria and Chief Sustainability Officer of Junior Group, which is the largest e-commerce platform in Africa, and was the first African tech startup to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. She oversees institutional relationships, corporate communication, and ESG as well for Junior across 11 countries in Africa. She previously served as the CEO of Junior Nigeria for more than four years, overseeing growth and transition of Junior Nigeria from online retail into a full digital ecosystem and including marketplace and logistics and payment services as well. And I'm sure we'll be hearing about some of that shortly. Today's ETL is also a collaboration between STBP and Stanford Seed, which is an initiative within Stanford Graduate School of Business that partners with entrepreneurs in emerging markets to build thriving enterprises that transform lives. And we're very happy to have Stanford Seed Executive Director, Darius Teeter, to host this conversation with Juliet. Before joining Stanford Seed, Darius served as vice president of global programs for Oxfam America. He has a BA in history from Yale, and a master in public policy from the Harvard Kennedy School. And if you're inspired by this conversation and want to learn more about the entrepreneurial climate in Africa, really encourage you to check out his podcast. It's called Grit and Growth. It involves the stories of entrepreneurs in Africa and South Asia, and also connect those stories to relevant perspectives and strategy insights from Stanford GSB faculty. And we'll pop a link to that podcast in the YouTube live chat. Welcome, Juliet and Darius. And with that, I will turn this session over to Darius. Thanks so much, Luke. Welcome, Juliet. So I have a bunch of questions. We'll try to do what we can do, but I also want to give students and other participants a chance to ask theirs as well. But I wanted to kick it off. Luke gave a very brief introduction to Jumia. But for those of us who don't know much about it, can you tell us just a little more what are the problems that Jumia is trying to solve? Yeah, thanks, Darius. So Jumia is an e-commerce platform, the largest e-commerce platform in Africa. And we started in 2012. And we started with a mission, very simple mission that, you know, we could improve lives with a power of the internet on the continent. And we are based in about 11 countries. And the 11 countries where we're based and actually cover a 70% of Africa's GDP and about over 500 million internet users. So the question is, like you said, what's the problem we're trying to solve? If you're a cell line in Africa many years ago, you only had two options on how you're going to retail your products to consumers. Either you had to pay a very expensive high street, relisted prices for a modern retail shop. Or you had no alternative but to operate in the open, open market, very informal open market is hard. It has no amenities or utilities and it's overcrowded. Those were the only options you had, especially if you were a small medium enterprise, just trying to get by. So, Jumia solves that problem for a host of millions of SMEs and sellers and merchants on the continent because you don't have to register on Jumia platform. You don't have upfront capital expenditure in terms of putting up retail space, literally minutes once you're registered and going through the training for selling online on Jumia, you can start your business. So that's a huge part of the problem. The second part of the problem, of course, was a logistics problem. So the first one was a distribution problem and even just staying on the distribution one, if you were consumer. But at the time you finally buy the products, chances are that the markups from the very long distribution chain from manufacturer to bulk breaker to host sale and finally to retailer and the neighborhood shop where you buy the item. You could be paying significantly more than you shoot as a consumer. So one was a distribution problem from the consumer's perspective and from a seller's perspective. So we're bringing millions of consumers to interact and transact with with the sellers directly with no intermediaries or any other agents agents in between. The second part of it is the logistics part of it. You know, we're also solving a logistics problem by integrating multiple logistics partners into one single integrated logistics. What we call a, you know, used to be called in my old accent, you're this as a pop here, but what it is is that you're using technology to integrate different asset owners. So using Jumia's technology to also be the, you know, manage the data and how they how they operate. So those are the question about that. You're sure it doesn't. Jumia doesn't own the logistics supply chain, but it has a platform that allows you to get the right players in there when you need them, where you need them. Exactly, exactly. Yeah. So it's an asset light model and and where a lot of the investment that is required because you have people who have the assets. You have people who have tricycles and vans and so on. But what was lacking was always the technology to integrate that together and to use the data to make, you know, quality decisions of, you know, where do you deliver what timeline is that required and so on and so forth. Yeah. And what about payments? I mean, I'm really curious because I love the, I love this transformation. I want to get back to the transformation that for the informal sector that's implied and everything you just said. But what about payments exactly. So payment was another part of it because I still remember about 2015 just not too long ago. If a consumer made a purchase on Jumia and we relied on just the, you know, payment through a card, a debit card, a credit card and had to clear the back end with a bank. Sometimes if there was a return, it could take two weeks because of course the, you know, the banks at the time e-commerce was not really something that they were really focused on. So we had to develop our own payment assist. Again, using the same principle of integrating different payment methods that a consumer could have into a seamless platform that allow us to, you know, clear what I was credit card or debit card or mobile money or bank transfer, whatever payment method that a consumer had. And we could also integrate it on that network. So that's the third component. And that's why it was at a three parts of our ecosystem. I'm kidding. So let's, I want to dig down a little bit more into the payments piece. I'm going straight into the weeds. Yeah, love to be. But are you using third party payment providers? I mean, there's so many startups now in this space, the Tintic Space in Nigeria. There's a lot of venture capital flowing in. You know, there's Lydia Payhippo. There's just a good, I mean, I've lost track of him any of the mark. Are you doing your own thing or you're working with all of these third party. We're working with, we're agnostic. So we're working with all, all third parties. Yeah. And especially given how large the market is, the real value you bring to consumers is not limiting them to your own solution is actually giving them a platform through pitch they could. They could use whatever payment method of methodology that they have. Yeah. That's an I'm actually so especially more sophisticated than what it's like here in the United States that I'm always struck by that like people are so excited that they can buy their Starbucks coffee with their phone and people were doing that in the Philippines nine years ago, 10 years ago. So I feel like we're catching up because of the dominance of credit card companies. So tell me a little bit about what is that bait. You know, using data. What is the transformation you're seeing in the informal sector, thanks to platforms like like Chimias. It's huge. I mean, because look at it, look at the number of sellers on in Africa who are small, medium enterprises in the informal market. And then when they get on to junior, look at the kinds of information that's available to them. Suddenly they know, for example, what which ones of their items are fastest moving, which are what price points, which particular color, if you're in fashion, if you're fashion seller and junior is suddenly know whether it's the blue shirt or the red shirt that actually sells better than than the other SKU that you have. That's very powerful information. They get information in terms of even the placement of the products, the information, the product information, which they put up on site, they get information on their seller score and all that. So really formalizing informal trade is what it is a huge, huge benefit that e-commerce, you know, e-commerce platform like Jimmy, I was bringing to to the sellers in Africa. So that's a huge, it's a huge part. That's a really big transition from from where the way before. So that I love that. That's the data analytics piece, which is some for some of them, I think probably data they've never had or they had intuitively or they had it on pen, you know, paper and pen. Yeah. Can you tell how many of your sellers are new sellers? I mean, in other words, that they would not be in a market place if it wasn't online. So we run a survey recently and I might be a bit shy, some of that information just in ranges. And we have sellers, you know, in between 30% to 40% of our sellers who say, look, you know, they started their business exclusive on junior. And some of them, some sellers start their businesses on junior, some sellers came to junior to expand their businesses. But what I actually find extremely interesting is the number of women sellers that we have on junior. So we have at least in Nigeria and Kenya, which are key markets, about 51% of our sellers are actually women. And why do women find it attractive? It's a gender agnostic environment. I mean, you could be a fashion seller, you could be an electronic seller and, you know, you don't have a, it's not a physical market where someone can make those kinds of gender related decisions or whether I want to buy an electronic product from a woman or not. So that is given them, you know, access to different categories that they could be forming to. It is also given women flexibility to be able to manage their homes and at the same time run a business of their own. And then third components that women say they really appreciate selling on junior, it's, it's the training. It's a training training on digital digital marketing training on how to sell online training on even how to read your account statements, just those basic kinds of training, you know, the importance for an SME just cannot be over and over and emphasized. I love that point, you know, we in in Sanford seed, we're always trying to get more women CEOs into our program. And we do commission to study to look at what are some of the barriers to entry for women entrepreneurs across the African continent. And you just hit a bunch of them access to capital. Like if you want to open a storefront, you're, it's going to be super hard to find that $1,000, $100,000 a month. The second is access to networks. Yeah. Women traditionally in not just in Africa, but across the world have trouble accessing networks. And then the third is access to technology, and I include training under technology, right? That is the most basic technology. Yeah, I'm not getting the same opportunity. So those are really powerful, powerful elements of the black one. Yeah, that's exciting. And there's a fourth element to it actually. And that's access to because you talked about some of the FinTech providers of financial services. So through Jimi app because we have Jimi a lending, we are also able to connect a lot of sellers to to loan opportunities, you know, to finance the working capital. So they're more about that. What is Jimi a lending? So Jimi a lending connects sellers on our platform leveraging the transaction data transaction history to then find working capital loans through all the financial services providers who who are partners to Jimi. So we don't lend off our balance sheet to the connection through to financial services providers. It makes total sense to me because in interviewing a number of FinTech CEOs for my podcast, you know, they're all using algorithms and machine learning to his alternative sources of data for assessing creditworthiness. And the number one thing they use for a little like working capital loans for trading companies and retailers is what's your repayment history. And it's not coming from banks because banks aren't doing 500 dollar loans. Yeah. And but the other one would be what's your revenue history. Right. So if you can show that from Jimi, hey, I'm, you know, this is my, this is not monthly revenue. Yeah, that's usually valuable to those FinTech algorithms because that's the data they need. That's interesting. But there's a great question here. I'm going to just instead of doing the 45 minutes and then questions. I just want to jump on you know this one because this is actually direction I wanted to go. Yeah, the question is how does Jimi evaluate markets for potential entry. And do you ever decide markets are no longer viable and the person who's asking this question mentions that you me a pulled out of camera room. Yeah, I want to tack on my own question of that. You mentioned you're in 11 countries 500 million people and accounting for some enormous percentage of the total GDP on the continent. Can you can you go to this question and talk a little bit about the barriers to regional expansion and what you look for when you pick a new country to enter. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, and that the question the questioner was actually right. Yeah, we had to pull out of camera and remember. There was a time when camera and the internet was shut down for almost a whole year. Okay. These are very important factors that we look at. We look at the, you know, this state of the economy. We look at beyond GDP beyond economic factors. We're also looking at readiness for an internet based business like ours. So those are very important nuances that that we consider in terms of looking at expansion. For now, we're we're deepening our footprints within the countries that we are in. Maybe in the future, but definitely for this year, we're really concentrating on on the those 11 countries where we're currently in. Is your phrase readiness is that code for regulatory environment? It could be regulatory. So for example, in some cases, you find that readiness, of course, internet access, reliability of internet access are very important factors, a cost of data for consumers is also very important. Now to the extent that those are determined by regulatory factors, then that that's where the link is, right. So those are just examples there. Is there an issue around business licenses for I mean, I can't tell you I worked in the development sector. How many projects I saw that, you know, where the title was formalizing the informal sector and I'm always thinking that's a terrible idea. It means, you know, chasing people around for unpredictable taxes, you know, but what is is that an issue to my business registration and licensing to a large extent, you know, except for areas that are quite regulatory in any market, which is really when it comes to financial services. But otherwise, it hasn't been from just the business registration perspective, we find that a lot of governments in Africa actually quite supportive. And and bear in my post COVID also, they realize the importance of digital platforms and a lot of governments are, you know, quite supportive and doing as much as they can to make sure that companies like us are operating well. Let's talk about COVID for a second. How important was COVID and the lockdowns, the determining factor and the growth of the commerce is just a blip in an otherwise rapidly growing bow wave or was it determined to take in your growth. I think it was a blip in Africa. I mean, look at it in the US here, the the US government, more or less, bankrupt retail during COVID, right. So put money in people's accounts and you're sitting at home. What are you going to do? You're going to spend the money online, right. So the Fed, bankroll retail during the pandemic, you don't have that equivalent in in other areas like Africa. So in some cases, we had intermittent lockdowns and movement restrictions. So it wasn't such a big factor in terms of of growth of of e-commerce rather e-commerce had had been on a trajectory given the fact that you have, like I said, you have over 500 million internet users. There's also a mobile first environment, right. So it's almost like Africans have been hungry to do more with their mobile phones and e-commerce just happened to be one of those areas. If there's any area where I think there was a lot more awareness during COVID about the potential of e-commerce, it's in the public policy and public agency environment where they suddenly realized that this is something that can actually be leveraged in the world. It's a very leveraged in a situation like a pandemic and has great potential for jobs and great potentials for economic development as well. Well, I want to use that as a segue to learn a little bit more about you. So you were CEO of Jamia Niger for four years coming from a decade as the director for Accenture in Nigeria. What shift? What inspired you to make that move? What was the, what did you see on the horizon? Several things. I mean, I'd been, like you said, I'd been in consumer goods had been in Accenture. I was partner for consumer goods responsible for all our clients in West Africa region. When I joined Jamia, I was a CEO for four years and some months. So as far as the market environment was concerned, I had enough experience in that area. I understood everything about distribution, route to market, supply chain, consumers and so on and so forth. But here was the non market environment and with great potential to impact the trajectory of any industry. I mean, one policy look at what happened with data protection and how it impacted a lot of big tech companies and so on. So I realized how important it was that we developed a structured approach in which we could engage with policymakers so that they understood the value and the potential of e-commerce and digital economy and could work with us in shaping the policy environment for it to nurture it to grow. So that's why I decided this was a very important area for me to look at. And the more I looked at it, of course, I also saw all the opportunities and sustainability and yeah. I want to, I definitely want to drill down sustainability issues and your in your new role is chairwoman for Jamia and chief sustainability officer. But I want to, since you brought up regulation again, I want to just take one quick detour there. And in speaking with a lot of, you know, tech enabled companies, Fintech, Medtech, Health Tech, the common complaints is that not so much complaint, but the observation is that we recognize that there is a role for regulation to protect consumers. The problem is when the regulatory authorities are not at the cutting edge of what's happening. So the regulations themselves, you know, even if they come from a place of good intention, they may actually be a hindrance or barrier growth. And so what's needed is a dialogue. And so my question to you is, is there a group of companies and people like yourself who are collaborating to work with regulators to say, let's get this right together. Yeah, definitely. So just on the on the context, people say that that you know regulators are not on the same plane, but it's our responsibility as private sector to educate right. And a lot of my work in the past year and so has been that education providing information to say that this is, this is what we're doing. To a large extent, we've actually spent more time just explaining this is what we're doing. This is, this is what a marketplace model looks like. These are the responsibilities of the platform versus the seller, you know, versus the consumer and all that. So I think it's our responsibility as private sector to do it. And that's what we've been doing. Okay. In other, in some of our markets also we've we've formed coalitions would like minded private sector companies in Nigeria, we have the e-commerce group within the legal chamber of commerce. I am actually the the first chairwoman of that of that council in Kenya, we have a private sector alliance and we have an e-commerce sector within the alliance. So all of those are opportunities to engage with regulators and it's always to the interest of private sector to engage early that way you can provide a necessary information and education and dialogue because they want to do the right thing they just want to be well informed in taking the right decision. Sometimes you provide parallels from other markets, you can show what's going on in the US or China and you know how the African environment is different and and you make your your recommendations and they listen. Yeah, I think in some in some sense because you have first movers advantage, I think in some for some fintech operators in some countries. Their problem is that the banks are are actually in front of them trying to advocate for restrictive policies because the banks are worried about being disrupted so in there they have a lot more leverage right and they've been around longer so. But I think that's probably less of a problem in e-commerce. I want to I want to now pivot the sustainability we've had a couple of questions in the in the Q&A about sustainability. You are responsible for sustainability for the group. What does that mean for Jumia what what and what are some of the key initiatives that you're focused on in the organization is focused on in the sustainability space. And the first thing for us is actually very clear validation that our mission itself is sustainable. Okay, so we don't have to invent some new projects to go after I mean it doesn't mean of course we would have to operate in a sustainable manner reducing in terms of our shipments reducing use of packaging materials and all that so all of those are very important hygiene factors which we. We build into our day to day operation but just realizing that our mission which is about in the end when you look at is about reducing inequality is so critical and is a big part of how we create value and how we create sustainable improvement and quality of lives on on the continent and asking ourselves what what more can we do with that mission and second part of it is. That we have a full ecosystem of many partners that working together can actually you know create more value for the communities that that we will live in than just Jumia itself we have sellers we have third party logistics partners we have brands who work with us so that's a full ecosystem that if we deploy can actually do a lot more for sustainability. So that's that's our focus and that's our area of attention for this first year I mean this is the first year that we're actually you know putting together practices what we're doing and we would have a report first report next year yeah. So I mean those are strong and admirable principles but for our audience help me make it concrete is this about carbon footprint is it about I mean what are like do you have KPIs in this sustainability space I you know and you can push back as if you just said it's year one so you know I get just started here but. Yeah help me help me make a practice help me make it real yeah a very practical example is how many sellers on Jumia. I classified as SME's how many sellers on Jumia have been able to get access to working capital loans to grow their businesses how many sellers on Jumia women how many of them have utilized the training facilities that we provide how many of them have utilized the loans to be able to grow their businesses. Those are huge huge areas of sustainability that we we haven't even scratched all of it right and I mean and for us that those let's let's utilize what we have first and then there are other levers of which which we can also concentrate on so those are some examples for you there yeah. Thank you I have another question here about you know the complexity of working with so many third parties for logistics and payments and the question is you know and at what point is Jumia decide we should build this in house versus we should partner and is that is that conversation ongoing or maybe that's a trade secret but I'm just curious to know. You have to be comfortable with complexity we're going to work in Africa okay we love complexity and and we we enjoy taking complexity and making simple so like I said earlier the problem is not. Assets right the problem is not people who have warehouses and Hobbes all of that exists you have people who have warehouses we have people who have Hobbes we have people who have. 10 trucks or some people have five tricycles we have all of those assets that exist so replicating on the asset side is on a make sense that yeah it's not it's not creating value the real asset that then drives e-commerce is is the engine which is really the technology okay so how do you know. Which day of the week you can make certain deliveries what is the speed of delivery and how do you how should you do your routing so that you're more fuel efficient you also reduce distance traveled all of those are relevant information you cannot get through just owning the assets you get that through owning the technology that puts it all together. And the value is the fact that all those players are utilizing your technology okay so you have the delivery agents who have your delivery app on their mobile phone you've got the third party logistics a players who are using your hope management system on their on in their businesses so that's how you create the real value and that's why we're concentrating there yeah. Yeah so your data is becoming increasingly valuable and important as well which for me is a great segue to another question about you me as next steps for scaling and growth is it about more regional expansion or broader scope of goods and services for the markets where you already are. Yeah it's it's more the second because all said and done we are the largest e-commerce platform on the continent but also in a continent where e-commerce and I would say all of modern trade is probably still within the ranks of two to five percent of total retail okay so huge huge upside yes huge huge upside so before you start tinkering with all the kinds of categories and you know new verticals. And so on just even that alone is is a significant area to to to focus on yeah and that's and that's what our focus is and I think the other thing we're focusing on as well is is really the shift that consumers have meet from using e-commerce coming to jimia to buy the electronics they wanted to buy products of high value because they could get it at a good price on jimia they could get you know the quality assurance and. And and all of that to the everyday products so people want to buy food people want to buy you know essential items home cleaning agents beauty beauty and for you. Consumables consumables basically that's a huge shift and that that's where we are also deepening our presence in yeah. So I want to I want to go to your competitive landscape in a second but I want to pause and talk about consumables because you want to the things that makes consumables possible here in the United States is that you can get it tomorrow right you can get your vegetables are still fresh that are maybe cold packed right you you need a toilet roll you need cleaning products whatever it is. Is that a big deal is that important to your consumers that they get something really fast or it is or or not not yet. Yeah there's always a trade off I think sometimes it's it's your what's the right word it's the consumers living environment that flows into their expectations okay so because in the States right next to corner there's either a crocker or there's a target or there's a wet man's or you know in your brand you know Harry Harry sorry is a Harry teeter. I'm trying to remember the name that you can pop into and buy so that flows into consumer expectations of you know when do I want to I want to like in 10 minutes of course you can use in the card as well and you get the product very quickly. In our environment is slightly different consumers are making trade-offs and for them it probably the pricing is more important because consumers want the best price in the fairly happy with convenience but we also see some of those expectations of I want to quick and fast flowing into into consumers expectations of how they want to deliver but to a large extent for consumers is the convenience of buying it online and the price point that's very important and we also invest in in what we call we have a program we call Phoenix program and a Phoenix program basically tracks about almost 50,000 items that are essentials that consumers want to buy so the basics and essentials or best sellers on junior so that at any point in time we want to consumer to buy those items on junior and save money relative to either or elsewhere so prices still a big big part of the of the equation for consumers. So you think this consumables segment may be growing faster than than hard goods. Oh we see we see it we see it already on our platform last year we saw the that in terms of items sold in some of our markets we began to see things like some countries I can remember which countries it is but you know sugar peas became top selling items for in those in those countries relative to what it used to be before where it might have been an electronic product mobile phone or something like that. Yeah and of course in markets like Nigeria where you know you have issues with par generation and access to par a par bank to par your phone was a top selling item in Nigeria last year we we we covered all of that in our e-commerce report e-commerce index report which we published about two or three weeks ago. So I got the perfect question here for you that just follows on this as part of your impact goals do you the junior have any special role in supporting or facilitating local manufacturing in the countries where you operate. We work very closely with brands so we have several brands that are listed on junior and we see an increase in interest from brands to be on junior for many reasons one being of for you. One being of course to that it gives an opportunity for them to go direct to the consumer through junior as a platform to it gives them very useful consumer insight and a lot of that consumer insight is in terms of packaging in terms of product specifications all of that is useful for a manufacturer in in development and product development and production. So yes I mean the asset is yes local manufacturers find being on junior extremely useful for for for their planning and demand demand planning and production yeah. Let's let's pivot a little bit to the competitive landscape who are your competitors is it con.com or take a lot you know other e-commerce companies that are in the continent or is Amazon a threat from afar. I think when we look at it at the end of the day competition is is more the informal market. Right because all of that put together you just talked about what it is conga or take a lot or any other platform or modern brick and mortar retail and so on and so on all of that like I said earlier just two to five percent max. Yeah so the real competition is the info is the informal market and and where every day working to bring more and more sellers through the to the platform and bring more brands to the platform. Excite more consumers where we're currently having a black Friday campaign on and it's usually is a very exciting period for consumers. I had no idea that existed on your platform we were the first to launch it in Africa in 2014. Around here that's like that's when I try to go for a hike in the woods because it's too bad everywhere else. Let me ask a bit more about you know where where does Jim jimmy look for it's you know it's it's vision do you look more to the east. You know Chinese e commerce like tau bow or JD or do you look more to western models as you think through your growth strategy. I will say honestly we look more at our consumers than anything else I mean it doesn't mean that we don't have parallels with all the markets share when you look at it from the basic ecommerce model. I will say we are much closer to the Asian Alibaba model because we're more of a market please okay and but then there are structural differences between Africa and China. Some of the infrastructure developments and even things like you know having a national postal system and driving down the cost of postal services. Some of those things which tau bow for example leapfrog in in in developing in China we don't have those in Africa so we look more at our consumers I would say in terms of what are the expectations what are the needs what's evolving for them in the market was critical. But yes like I said in terms of parallels of the basic e commerce model itself yes pretty similar to to the Alibaba kind of model so I mean the other thing I mean Alibaba is doing this a bit now but I'm also thinking about this rise of social commerce so. Antic talk Instagram and Facebook have become major marketplaces and they connect brands you know directly to the consumers they have so called influencers is brand ambassadors yeah is this a threat to Jimmy as business model is this a direction that you want to go how do you view social commerce. We view social commerce as complimentary to some respects in the sense that I mean there's a lot of social commerce on WhatsApp and Instagram like you mentioned but it's also exposed some of the challenges of social commerce in terms of protection of consumers sometimes you order something it doesn't get delivered and you don't have a system whereby. You can trust in in the returns process you can trust in quality assurance and so on. Every time we pull our consumers they tell us that one of the things they really really love on junior is they don't want to deal with a seller they don't care who the seller is okay I mean that's speaking figuratively. The person they have relationship with is junior so something goes wrong they want to know that is you me at the dealing with we will always talk about the fact that when you're ordering online that many things will provide the items probably being QC it's been you can see the seller score so you can make decisions between multiple options which sell out to go with payments and all of that so there's a whole lot that's writing on just completing a purchase online that consumers. Because like the option of having someone you know the intermediary the platform that is taking some of those responsibilities for them. Let's talk about that case is still there I mean that case is still a valid value proposition for consumers. So let's talk about trust I'm you know I'm a frequent user of Amazon eBay and I've been ripped off many times and I you know there are recourse. There's me course but yeah but they're you know slow and non satisfactory. How is this going on your platform is there a lot of problems. We have I mean for any marketplace of course you would have issues sometimes with sellers and so on and so forth but like you mentioned we do have recourse mechanisms we have penalties we have we score sellers by many things by speed of delivery by the quality of the item but a return rate of the items that they sell on the platform. So many things are built into it and of course we have seven items which must be QC we have a manufacturer warranties that we offer everything they can think of from a recourse perspective. And for some of our consumers also depending on the type of item and the specific consumers behavior on our platform sometimes a consumer wants to return something and we refund immediately even before the item is retrieved. So there are many things we're built into creating an environment that consumers can trust and feel comfortable and to shop online. There's a question here from an anonymous attendee can you explain why as an Africa focused Nigerian led company. Jumea decided to set up its headquarters in Berlin in IPO and the New York Stock Exchange why did you choose those locations instead of for example Nigeria. Well that's an interesting question don't forget that in terms of registration we had always been historically registered in Berlin just because of course our first founders and funders rather was a German company and we retain that over there. So we have to retain that over time. So we haven't changed that. Of course people ask I remember people have asked this question you know why in New York because when you're going through an IPO process when you're trying to establish funding for long term growth of the company also looking for an environment that will not only provide you with capital. But we're the investing public to a large extent understand the business model are familiar with that business model because other companies of the same business model have gone through that that environment to seek capital right so that's very important. It would have been very new in an African environment maybe sometime in the future we could consider also listing in an African environment but at that time it was very important that when you considered London considered New York and other capital environments that New York investing market had a very deep experience with e-commerce. So another question here this question this person is wondering does to me a plan on creating any in house products considering the relative competitive advantage in labor cost in many African countries. I can only say at the moment is not one of our key areas of focus are key areas of focus right now is actually like I said deepening our presence in the markets that we're currently in. And there's still quite a lot of potential in terms of our salt meant in food and basic consumer goods consumables that consumers want so you know we would we be partnering more with sellers and brands you know to bring more of that assortment to consumers. I mean that makes sense to me because I think you also have in 11 countries you have 11 sets of consumer preferences and cultural preferences it's not like Amazon making batteries you know cheap batteries it's doesn't quite look like that. Another question here what is the hardest thing about serving the African market. I would say the hardest thing was gaining the trust of consumers from the beginning okay I still remember that so that was the hardest thing and we as you recall we we we offered and we still offered to some extent cash and delivery as one of the ways to gain consumer trust yes we invested a lot in offline engagement we have a J for agent. Network also to educate consumers and win their trust on the fact that look if you order it online it's going to be safe your your money's in green anywhere and you know Jumia has the systems and policies in place to handle any problem that you have so that's that was number one the second one was also convincing sellers of a marketplace model. I mean they're being used for decades to retail retail so you come to me you pay for it I give it to you and that's it we're done right but here's a marketplace model that I say list the products and I'll pay you as you sell that's a completely different mindset so those were I would say the the tofa areas but over time we built that trust also on the seller side and now we have a very vibrant marketplace. I mean that's a big one right so yeah in talking to fintech players in Nigeria the number one problem they're solving is working capital and somebody might need $300 to restock their inventory tomorrow and they actually need that money tomorrow they're going to sell those goods the day after tomorrow and no bank is interested in that business right yeah and so you know that has been I think that's a game changer right because you can never grow if you can never really find finance your inventory yeah so there was a question here about to what extent do you believe Jemeah will accelerate development in Africa I can imagine a couple of pathways for that to happen but I'd like to hear what you think. I mean it's already contributing to development on the continent there was a BCG report that talked about the fact that look in a marketplaces like Jemeah by 2025 could be contribute almost 3 million jobs on the continent so in terms of you're talking about jobs that's one number two you're talking about formalizing infrastructure formalizing informal retail like you mentioned you also also recognizes another area which is the cross border trade within Africa itself so those are many pathways and many areas in which e-commerce and companies like Jemeah can make significant contribution to the continent yeah. Julia with with our little bit of time left I want to make another pivot and I have some questions I was thinking about for our audience and one is kind of a general question what is the entrepreneurial ecosystem look like in in Lagos right now where you're based if you were a young entrepreneur from Nigeria interested in pursuing you know scalable technology driven innovation what sorts of resources are available when it comes to advice and funding. There are many hopes I can certainly talk about and I'm not holding brief for any particular hope but I know CC hub is one of them in Lagos there are a couple of other hopes as well and networks where young especially particularly young tech entrepreneurs can find resources information and networking environment where they can you know meet with funders they can meet with. Fellow tech entrepreneurs as we call them to exchange ideas and and and and grow their business so quite a number of them exist in in Lagos I just remember CC hub that comes to mind readily. What about for do you have some advice for entrepreneurs who are not from Africa but might be interested in exploring the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Africa where where would they start should they get to know what's going on in a particular city or the regional convenings networks that they should tap into i'm thinking here about you know grad students coming out of school yeah yeah excited about the opportunities on the continent and don't know how to get how to dip their toe in the water. I mean first things is decide where where do you want to picture tent and they've I mean I can talk about so many areas I mean there's agriculture is a big one ag tech is a big one that's evolving education is another one and of course health care so. This one of the big big areas in my view is is is health care and is really about how do we make more efficient use of the health care assets we have. On the continent so any any use of technology that frees up doctors time and uses their time more efficiently connects people to primary health care providers. I know uses data to help the doctors in making decisions those things I think are big areas for for development on the continent. I mean what's fact what I love all three of those examples because they're essentially they've turned last mile delivery on its head yeah i'm old enough that I remember when we were you know World Bank and African Development Bank would put all this money into creating physical infrastructure to get teachers from here to over there right. And just like nobody you know and then I years ago I lived in Indonesia and if you wanted a landline for your phone you waited four years to get the landline installed nobody nobody has a landline who cares right so yeah now not everything can be done remotely but I am struck by how much of the disruption it is to do last mile delivery of so many services digitally. I think I told them the same pages you I have another this is quite a technical question but I appreciate this one in it and it's about delivery and geolocation. You know I guess your delivery systems are also rely on third party technology and does that limit what you can do with your geolocation data the user the this person asked does geolocation activity feels like a substantial factor for bringing Africa's domestic economy into the modern age. And you see Jemea monetizing geolocation data more as a public service you know funded by the government. I mean geolocation data is great but this is an environment where we also build solutions around the fact that some consumers just don't have acts they are not covered by post codes and and those kinds of information that make geolocation easy to track right so we have pick up stations and we have. We have delivery agents who are more or less knowledgeable about specific villages and localities where consumers live you know how it is you know who lives behind who even if there's no formal postal code to deliver there yeah so. Let's we have a full-run customized solution for the African environment maybe in the future like you said of course when there's broad coverage across all locations with all the right codes and so on yes we could consider other other areas of investment yeah. I'm going to go back to our listeners because it's a very interesting question here for you i'm just going to read it verbatim when do you see an inflection point for your business in terms of consumer adoption Jemea has spent billions of dollars but they're only seven million ma use on the platform i don't actually know what an m u is so. Tell me what that is yeah and then may use monthly active users okay so i mean people think about inflection points but we we just say to ourselves look this this a huge huge opportunity in the market so. So i don't predict what an inflection point will be but all I know is that every day that we are increasing the number of users we have on a platform we're increasing the. Assortment that we have we're increasing the number of sellers bring in more brands creating excitement providing products and at the right prices for consumers that is all part of the work that needs to be done and that's what we're focus will be for the foreseeable future.
