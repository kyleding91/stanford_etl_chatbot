 You are listening to the Draper Fisher-Jurvinson entrepreneurial thought-leader seminar, brought to you weekly by Stanford Technology Ventures Program at Stanford University School of Engineering. I know a lot of, just like your classmates and anybody who's been hanging around Stanford the last few years, we know a lot of people who work at Google. My God, it's beginning to be like, I know a lot of people who work at Zazzle as well, because a lot of Stanford students have gone that way. And it feels just like another Google in that sense as a professor. They both were economics majors here. And here's another unique thing. They both sat in this very room about five or six years ago, and this very, type of seminar series. So it's not only walking them back to Stanford, it's walking them back to this seminar series, which I think was friday, we were draconian in those days. It was friday afternoon at 430 instead of Wednesday afternoon 430. They really see who were the hardcore entrepreneurs in the making. But so let's welcome back Jeff and Bobby, and they don't even have to take it for credit this time. Let's, here they are. Thank you so much. Welcome. Thanks Tom for that introduction. Actually, I think you guys are going to have to indulge us for just one second. We're going to try and make something happen. So we're going to take a quick picture. We're going to take it in front of the crowd because we need this kind of background. He's at it. Come around like this. Want to commemorate the event. All right. So if everything goes according to plan, you'll see why we did that. So anyhow, thanks Tom for the introduction. As you mentioned, I'm Bobby Beaver. This is my esteemed colleague and brother, Jeff. We are co-founders of a very exciting, very dynamic, very quickly growing, very in need of top quality talent company called Zalil, just about a mile away from here in Palo Alto, California. As Tom mentioned, we were both Stanford students not too long ago. And we're going to talk quite a bit about that over the course of the next hour or so. And really, I just wanted to say thank you to Tom and to everybody here for having us back, giving us an opportunity to talk to you guys about our experiences over the last couple of years. A couple of reasons we're really excited about that. The first one being they rarely let us out of the office. So this is a nice escape. The second one being Jeff and I tend to be verbose when it comes to Zalil. We love talking about it with anybody who's willing to listen. So we always appreciate the opportunity to talk about Zalil. And then the third one is, and probably most relevant to you guys, as Tom said, we both took this class numerous times when we were at Stanford. And it's pretty easy for us to think back to being in those chairs and looking and listening to presenters and thinking about what it meant to be entrepreneurial, what it meant to build a company from scratch, what it took to really try and achieve a vision or an idea. And so really when Jeff and I were putting this presentation together yesterday, we really tried to think through what it meant to be in your spot, what we could try and answer, what we could try and talk about to make this really meaningful and impactful for you, try and convey at least a few lessons in what we've learned over the last couple of years. So that being said, I'll just give a quick overview of what the next hour is going to look like. What we're going to do at the outset is just to give a very brief synopsis of what Zalil is, I promise, we could easily talk about it for hours, but that is not the purpose of this presentation. Really what we want to focus on is what our experience in entrepreneurship has been and what it's meant to us, where the pitfalls have been, where we've succeeded, where we've failed. And to that end, we're really just going to try and tell our story, taking it back to 99 when we were sophomores and juniors at Stanford and carrying it all the way through it today, whereas Zalil stands. Over the course of that story, hopefully what we can do is distill a couple of our lessons, our major thoughts, our takeaways, what those have been. You can find them here on the wall on this side and I think there's another one somewhere else. We're going to call those lessons we've learned. That's another thing we want to try and get across really early here is that we wouldn't presume to know what it takes to be successful, not going to try and convey anything to you in that regard. All we're going to try and do here is talk about what we've learned for ourselves over the course of this time and hopefully that's useful for you in some way or another. So anyhow, we're going to outline up front, we're going to give you the conclusion initially, we're going to say, hey look, these are our lessons and hopefully you can use that as a reference point and we can too throughout our story and we can point to the fact that, hey this took passion or this took a lot of hard work or this took confidence. Once we do that, we're going to go dive right into the story itself, starting at Stanford, carry it through to today and after we get through with that, we'll round up the lessons again, convey that into the Zazzle way, what it means to build a Zazzle culture right now, how we try and operate, how we're trying to achieve our goals and then finally we're going to try and leave some time for Q&A, open things up, we're happy to answer questions on whatever you guys are curious about, whether it's the business, whether it's about our particular experiences, anything within reason we're happy to talk about. So with that being said, I'm going to hand it over to Jeff and he's going to tell you about Zazzle. User-created products such as those posters on the walls and t-shirts from individuals and amateurs and professional artists and actually collections of branded content such as Disney and even the Hoover Institution at Stanford. So if you're not going on the site to create products with your own content, you can buy what's already there and this is really unique. You can actually customize the existing products in the marketplace which means you can go to Disney and jump on Zazzle and you can select from many thousands of different designs and artworks and actually customize it further. So you can add your own name, add a phrase, resize the image, move it to the back. This is actually a really powerful concept that we'll talk about later but it's the notion of personal empowerment and personalization within commerce. Okay, so again the products, you see a lot of them here already. We do everything from apparel to prints, even this big and we're really excited about the Dark Apparel line actually which is new for us. So the t-shirts that the Zazzle is here are wearing today are actually prototypes. The long sleep black t-shirt is not on the website so you'll be the first to get them if you pick one up on the way out. So again apparel everything from infant styles to ladies t-shirts to polos to ringers and vintage styles with posters really the options are really limitless. You can get anything teeny to big with framing options that are probably actually too much. Creating cards and most recently stamps. Believe it or not you can actually create real US postage on Zazzle right now. By going to the website which is a really hot product and it's really cool. So I want to talk about just very briefly the different aspects of the marketplace. What comprises it? You have buyers, you have sellers and the community that binds them together. And I've already talked about the products but the interesting and powerful thing about the buying experience on Zazzle is that people are really creating products from their imagination. They're using their own content, things that are personal and meaningful to them. So comparing Zazzle to traditional commerce it's really we've found to be much more enriching and meaningful and personal. So the focus is on the individual rather than the brand when you're for example pulling something off a shelf at a traditional retail store. So sellers we really feel like we're trying to unleash the creativity out there. There's so many millions of unique creative special artists out there and they've never had the opportunity to display their works much less monetize them. So it's as we really feel like we're the advocate, the partner, the champion of their creativity and we want to find new ways to help them earn great monetization and compensation from their works. And lastly community this is kind of an intangible but very important we believe to the marketplace where we're connecting buyers and sellers and actually within sellers and within buyers in unique ways that have never before been possible. So for example a digital artist like Creative 82 here from Illinois is actually a college student connecting with some buyer in France or Germany or Asia or selling these products all across the world and these people are actually interacting and communicating amongst themselves. So here it looks like we lost one of the images but just wanted to provide some images to give an example of the buying experience. Again I've talked about the meaningful and enriching nature of these products because they are personal. You can see in the image in the upper right it's probably too small to tell but this is a new father and mother who just had a child and the father actually created a t-shirt on Zazzle with an ultrasound image of the baby right there for the birth. And having done this grassroots growing of Zazzle we've interacted with all these customers and we answer their emails and we talk to them and communicate with them and they've really found that when somebody is waiting for a Zazzle order it's important it's something they really care about. And down here to the right we've got an example of the design tool that we're currently continuing to improve. We're really creating some cutting edge unique technologies to provide a designing experience that's really interactive and really engaging so it really actually feels more like Photoshop than a web page. Sellers here, you've got sellers all over the world, Alejandro, Dennis Holmes, Ochoa, just wanted to provide some examples here and actually show you some of the faces behind Zazzle which is pretty important. And in the upper right here this is an image that means a lot to Bobby and I because it was actually the first legitimate poster ever contributed to the Zazzle site and this was back in about 2001 and at the time it was still a beta password protected and we're checking the site every few minutes to see if anybody was going to use it or you know upload an image or make a product and this guy turns out he's Russian, his name's Demetri Savanoff and he's an amazing digital artist. All of a sudden one day I think it was maybe 20 hours later after we launched he contributed this poster and we were just in awe we couldn't believe it. We bought it immediately we put it all over you know our dormit Stanford it was just phenomenal and really gratifying and he was actually pretty surprised to get some royalties from that poster and like the first day so we started actually getting some traction in the digital art community initially which was a great start. So lastly here sellers we have individuals such as the contributors but what's also unique about Zazzle is we're aggregating all this branded recognizable content as well. And the reason being is what we've developed on the back end is a you know on-demand manufacturing system such that you can create a t-shirt such as the ones up there profitably even one at a time which is really unique. So that means Disney can actually provide us several thousand images and they don't have to inventory any t-shirts or anything they can just upload them our inventory is effectively just the server storage base of these image files. So we're working with institutions like Hoover the Library of Congress, Family Guy Entertainment properties such as Star Wars and Marvel Comics and even just big corporations like Coca-Cola and the number of these is going to increase dramatically soon as well. So with that all passes back to Bobby to get into the introduction to the lessons we've learned. So if you guys are going to fall asleep just let me get through this slide first. This is a conclusion as I set up front hopefully if we do our job in the course the next half hour these will be self-evident. This is really what we're trying to drive through is the things we've learned over the course of the last six years. The first one you must have fashion. Can't say this one enough. I imagine over the course of this quarter you'll hear this said time and time again from different entrepreneurs and it's true because the reality of building a business trying to make a vision or a dream real is that it's really tough. There are certainly high highs but there are just as many or more low lows and the only thing ultimately that you can fall back on is the people that you're working with and also your vision, your passion for the business itself. I think everybody has different passions. They have different reasons for getting into different ventures. In our case it was trying to do something interesting together and with time that's evolved into a very large vision for enabling creativity across the globe and so on and so forth. You've got to have something. I would strongly contend that it shouldn't just be monetary. This doesn't make sense after a while. There's a lot of sacrifice along the way and the only thing at the end that can justify all this work is really caring about solving a problem, trying to make something real. This is the first and most important lesson in many ways is you've got to have passion. You've got to care about what you're trying to do. The second is we'd hope to convey to you just how much a small group of people or even just an individual can accomplish. I think that's especially true given the way that technology has evolved with open source availability and those types of tools. It's amazing what one, two, three, four people can get done. I guess taking this class I would hope you don't come away with the impression that to build a potentially important company you need $10 million in the bank and 50 people to do it, that isn't the case. I think if you take a look at any of the successful internet companies over the course of however long you'd find that they all start small. They all start with passion. They all start with a small team that really cares about what they're doing and is willing to work hard. I would just say that Jeff and I have certainly learned through our experiences that small teams can accomplish a tremendous amount. That segues into the next point which is how confidence, how confidence in yourself, in your team to get something done. I think another kind of corollary to that is don't be intimidated by what you don't know. Certainly as we hope to elicitate in the story of Zazel we had no idea what we were doing literally in any regard. I didn't know how to build a company. I didn't know how to try and reinvent digital printing for a peril. I didn't know how to build a website and e-commerce infrastructure. I didn't know how to talk to collections but we were there too naive to think that we could get that done or we had the confidence that we could figure it out if we needed to. That's just another important lesson I would say that we learned is to have confidence in yourself, your intuition, your ability to overcome something you might not know how to do at the outset. The fourth is to question everything. Certainly coming out of school, not having really any experience or context for creating a company or even being in any other companies, we had no idea what the status quo is or was. Along the way as we've continued to grow, there's certainly a lot of different inputs on well this is how you should do this, this is how you should do that. Don't accept it. Don't accept the status quo. You should ask about everything and understand how people do things and why but don't just give in to the notion that it's done this way and that's how it should be done. Always question what people are telling you, always question what the right thing to do is and don't be afraid to try something new in an effort to make it better. The fifth is kind of Kurt, Adapt or Die, it's true. In Zazzle's case, we didn't have an explicit built out detailed plan or vision for exactly where we would be today at the outset. We've had to adapt at every step. The reality at least in our situation was that the landscape competitively or otherwise was changing all the time and we needed to accommodate that, whether it was on a technological front or with competitors. We always had to be able to adapt to take and make the most of our opportunities along the way. And the last point, maybe even more important than the first, is that people are more important than anything else and it's really true. Zazzle and I imagine any company for that matter is nothing more than the people that comprise it. And that's why we're so focused on things like culture, so focused on trying to propagate with the passion, the vision for the company is I think if you talk to, and I imagine you'll hear from some very well-regarded venture capitalists, they would say the same and their successful companies, what's most important early on is to build a great team and to have confidence in that team because it all grows from that kind of core. So you can all go to sleep now. We'll talk about how we came to those conclusions by describing to you the story of how we got where we are. As I mentioned, this all for us started back in 1999 when we were in school here. I graduated in 2000, Jeff graduated in 2001, we were both econ majors. We actually both have a long history in engineering and computer science in particular, back to kind of hobby in high school. And so we had that kind of context heading in. But the 98, 99 timeframe as I imagine you guys remember or have read about was just simply nuts. It was especially crazy here. It felt like anyway, just thinking personally to the number of people I knew starting adventure, joining a new venture, it was crazy. And you're talking about people in totally unrelated fields, hopping out of their career path in an effort to try something new. In many ways it was totally awesome. But I think it was, it was great. And I mean, I can remember experiences where being there, listening in class and the professor had to leave early to go to a board meeting or to a founder's launch or whatever. I think everybody was consumed in the notion of making a lot of money or trying something new or any half cocked idea can be successful. And so the reason I provide that is because that was kind of the context with which we were forming our ideas around Zazel. And I think Jeff and I were lucky in that that wasn't our first experience with entrepreneurship. Our father is a very successful serial entrepreneur. He's done a lot of things over the course of his career. That's how we grew up with that kind of in the home at the outset. So this wasn't something new to us. And what he provided in stark contrast to what we were finding at school and hearing on the news and so forth was a deep commitment to old school rules, things like actual margins and what you're selling, a commitment to your customers, those types of things. And whereas he hadn't had any experiences directly in the internet, he was very interested in the internet space in general. And we could provide a lot of that insight to him. And what he provided to the mix was his experiences in building companies, understanding what it takes to put something together to start something. And together I think we formed a good team. And so the three of us co-founded the idea of Zazel while we were still in school. The approach we kind of took wasn't necessarily inspired by any particular event. We decided that maybe more as an exercise than anything else, we would think about different ideas, different opportunities on the internet. What can we do that isn't being done currently? What can we do that would be meaningful or interesting? What can we build a real business around? And for a lot of different reasons, we ended up talking about the imprinted apparel market in particular. This was a market and is a market that turns out it's just huge in size. It's conservatively 20 to 25 billion dollars in the US alone. And what that means, imprinted apparel, I don't mean shirts like this, it's stuff, t-shirts that have imprinted designs on them. And when we looked harder, it was pretty clear there were no major or dominant internet presences in this field. And additionally offline, there weren't any suppliers, any major suppliers that were dominating the market. And the reason under the covers was that it's an extremely antiquated technology. What enables imprinted apparel is a process called silk screening or screen printing. And I don't want to digress too far, but I think it's important to understand. Basically the way the process works is, if you have a design for t-shirt, for example, the first step you go through is to separate it out into a bunch of different colors. And you have to create physical screens for each of those colors. And the process for creating the final design is basically to lay out the shirt, put the screen down, push paint through for each of those colors. And then once you've layered them up, set it by basically cooking the shirt. The result is great. The output's fantastic. The problem is you have to amortize that initial investment in the screens across considerable quantity in order to get the per unit priced out. So you can't get an individual screen printed t-shirt in quantities less than probably 100 at a price of like 10 bucks. It's just... Right. The colors are also very limited to design process sucks. So this for us was an immediate opportunity. It was a big market. It was something that we could try and address directly with technology. And we knew, in addition to solving the technological problem, if we built a website around it, if we built a marketplace around the idea of this technology and enabling people to create real products in quantities of one or two that we'd really have something special. And so in the remainder of our tenure at Stanford, Jeff and I spent a lot of time studying the successful internet models, what made eBay tick, what made Dell tick, what was successful about Amazon, and then trying to put those together into something that was unique and different, and we called it Zazzle. And so to our mind, at least at the time, what Zazzle was for us was a combination of eBay and the sense that we were building a marketplace as Jeff described earlier around this product. And Dell and the sense that we were going to be a pioneer in on-demand manufacturing. And one was predicated on the other. So I think the other important point to make is that when we did finally decided to go attack this technology, we knew that if we could make it work, the margins would be great. And that could act as the basis for fueling the growth of the company. We always had the mindset initially not to go pitch the idea and take a bunch of money and market it on the super bowl or whatever else. The idea was to make the model itself so compelling and to create network effects around it such that this thing will grow on its own. And that all came down to being able to manufacture a product in our case with margins that would support incentivization schemes like royalty models, referral models, that sort of thing. And last point I just wanted to make and I kind of made a mental note to myself on the slide is that they're skeptics. Even in the heyday when everybody's idea was a great idea and it seemed like you could finance anything. There were skeptics everywhere. There were skeptics at Stanford, skeptics amongst friends or family. There were skeptics when we were first trying to make the technologies work. And that's another point. You got to have confidence in your idea. You got to have passion around what you're doing. And if you really think you can make it work, you can make it happen. You can probably go ahead and do it. So bootstrapping, this is really the mode we fell into. In my senior year I stopped out for a while and certainly as soon as I graduated, this is the mode we took was to basically find a garage in Palo Alto and we did and set up camp and try and address the major challenges of the business. We knew there was a corporate aspect. That was Robert. He was going to take care of that. He had done that before. We needed to build a new invent, a new direct print technology for cotton substrates in particular. It's a tremendously difficult problem for lots of different reasons. And the man for the job was a guy by the name of Gene Westorberg, who's a guy that had worked with my dad in the past in previous ventures. And he had direct experience with digital printing and those sorts of things in the past. So we were fairly confident. So as he, that he could make it work. And in the final challenge, Jeff and I, a bunch of econ majors, decide that we're just going to build a website from scratch, which was kind of a good idea, mostly not a good idea, but it ended up working out. And so anyhow, we knew the challenge. We knew the different components. We had the team defined and we just set out to go ahead and do it. Just to dive in a little more detail with the direct print stuff. Again, kind of re-emphasizing this point about small teams and confidence to see give you an idea for how hard direct printing on a peril is. This is something we had heard Haynes spent $50 million on and got nowhere with. This has long been considered to be the holy grail in apparel printing for lots of reasons. There's only way to print designs and quantities of one or two that isn't complete garbage. That would really be powerful. And that's what we were setting out to do. With regard to the website, it's a relatively difficult task. There was an e-commerce component to the whole thing, actually taking orders, fulfilling those, actually driving the production process on the backend, writing print drivers, trying to control production flow and tracking. There was the whole notion of taking content in. That's relatively commonplace now in the web, but at the time, we had to write all the input libraries to take the data in and save it to backend storage and that sort of thing. We were really trying to figure out how to make all this work as we were going and ended up being a rather difficult challenge. So anyhow, the picture's here. That's Robert on the left. There's Jean on the right. There's Jeff right below him. That's him. That's him. That's him. Okay, great. So I'm going to take the latter half of bootstrapping here. We wanted to not just talk and look at text, but actually show you what does starting a company look like. What does bootstrapping mean? Well, it means you do everything. Literally everything you clean the toilets. You deliver the orders. You write all the code. You do everything. So we wanted to show some examples of that and some of the more laborious stuff we always turn into parties, quote unquote, such as our box making parties here. We would make these boxes to ship our posters in, which was fun. We do that an hour every day. There's Robert there rolling up a poster. He was especially good at rolling posters. I was best at printing shirts. So just to give you an idea of the scale, what we've undergone in last 12 to 15 months or so is this old facility we had was about 2,800 square feet and now we're expanding out of 35,000 square feet. Part of that is we were crazy fitting everything into this old facility. And just gives you some indication of how hectic it actually was. Towers of del boxes everywhere. You're literally sitting next to somebody in an inch or two away. We'd had to store a ton of supplies and everything outside in the parking lot. There's actually a toilet there, which is a little creepy, but that wasn't ours. I'll remember why that was there. Some other fun examples of literally construction happening in the background. People are hammering and sawing and building stuff. So we knocked down the wall of this car garage into an adjacent facility that we expanded into. And so here's us in the middle trying to have a serious meeting when all those constructions going on and things are crazy. And that's actually mean the right with Greg. This is a few weeks before we launched the website in 2003. And I had to be the model for the apparel on the website, which is a little scary. Meanwhile, all the constructions happening, we're trying to get everything done. So just to give you a little substance behind, it is a little crazy. It is a lot of sacrifice. There are a lot of things you got to do that you don't think about when you start off to say you want to build a company. There are more examples of literally building, shelving, and the supplies of reconstructing our little Zazel home there. So more bootstrapping, this is getting into launching the website, which is kind of an interesting phase in our history, where the concept of a social life or life outside of Zazel was nonsense. And we lived on caffeine here. This is Robert wheeling in a bunch of crates of rock star and red bull. I think rock star should be illegal. It's bad stuff. Don't get started. We got addicted. And it was bad. Here's Bobby actually right here sitting right adjacent to our server rack or first server rack. For those of you who have not been in a server room before, servers output a lot of air. I got to cool down the processors. And there was about 20 servers right next to Bobby's head blowing directly on his face. And the problem was his eyes would dry out and you couldn't see. So we had to get him some ski goggles right there. So you know, he could continue coding and drinking caffeine. And this was right after a crispy cream run, which is also good for sugar high. Some more fun launch craziness. Bobby dancing around in the server room. Clean some parts for hardware right there. Launching the website, the effects of extreme sleep deprivation. Yes, yes. We, part of this was a study in how far you could go to actually disassemble your body and your functions. And this is us just coding in our little room. And this is kind of the end result with the last push to finally get the website out. We were sleeping underneath our desks. It was not pretty. And this is me, probably the most unflattering picture I could have picked myself. This guy convinced me I had to put it in here. We were cycling through photos last night. But yeah, it's grueling. It's so much work. We set out to build all this code and we really had to learn it from scratch. And we didn't use anything from third parties and everything from the graphics to the database to the middle here. It was a lot of work. So we launched. It was awesome. It was in about the mid of 2003. And it was just amazing to see almost immediately the activity on the site and the viralness and the word of mouth and people actually doing stuff and conducting business on the site literally minutes after we launched. So what does all this mean? They're funny photos. They're good stories. But really it comes back to passion. You have to be passionate about the product you're building, your customers, your users, the people you're working next to because you're living and breathing it. And if you're thinking about some sort of monetary reward, it's just not enough. It's not good enough. Small teams doing a lot. It's not just with this launch. We'll get into later. But all these guys, the news has theirs and what they're doing already is phenomenal. And here we could have done this whole thing in just photos and that probably would have been funnier but less educational. We would hand deliver orders to local residences because we wanted to see how much could we delight our customers. If somebody places an order of 20 custom t-shirts, we deliver it. It's less than an hour. That's amazing. So we would do that. We would bike them down or drive them down and deliver to people. It was always this constant addiction. How do we do it better? How do we make the website better? How do we ship faster? How do we make the products higher quality? And it's just invigorating. And lastly, having confidence in yourself. I think we beat that pretty well already. Oh, actually, an important point on that. Proactively learning what you don't know. It's not just having confidence. You got to recognize what your strengths are, what you do know. What you don't know, definitely try to learn. Definitely talk to people, talk to your professors and advisors and friends and use your network to learn what you don't know. OK, so the last two phases we wanted to talk about about the Zazzle history was raising capital and the present. And we're running a little long, so I'll be brief on this. At the time, in fall of 2004, we were generating significant revenue. We had no marketing. We had no real development other than just the website. And just purely from the word of mouth and network effects, the community, the marketplace was gaining traction. So we were teetering on profitability and we didn't need money. We did not need capital, which is really unique for startups. And pretty much all of a sudden one day, a very prominent venture capitalist came knocking on the door and he said, hey, what's up guys? What are you doing? Checked out the website. I think you're doing something really interesting. And I see long-term potential for this. And we were just like shocked, pure shocked. We're humbled. We were thrilled. It was confusing. We couldn't believe it. Something that we pulled together, we're just a few people over the course of a few really long, hard years. Somebody like this could recognize it. Yeah, there is a grander vision. There is something very powerful with this concept. So we definitely took it upon ourselves to do our own due diligence on the process. Is venture capital going to add something more than just money? Because we could have done this without capital. That was the key question. And whether we wanted to grow organically or if we really wanted to commit to a faster pace in a bigger scale in order to maximize the bigger vision of what's as it is. So long story short, we met with a few firms and we finally met Kleiner Perkins. And I can honestly say, I think and we believe they have a very unique value system and a strong culture fit with how we wanted to grow the company and how we thought about our business. So pretty much immediately after we met their partners, we knew that they had a shared vision for what's as it could be. And they could really help us, you know, be hands on and help us build this into something great and leveraging their expertise and their experience and their connections to really take Zazzle to the next level. So John Dorr and Aileen Lee are the team members from Kleiner on this Asel team. John sits on the board in addition to Ram Sharam. When we met Kleiner, they insisted, they were emphatic. They said, you have to meet Ram Sharam. You have to meet him. And we said, okay, you know, of course we obliged. We love to meet him. Didn't know much about him at the time. And we pretty much agreed after the first meeting with Ram that this is somebody who could add a ton of value to the company. This is a hands-on, operational leader in so many great successes. He was at Netscape. He founded Jung Lee and then was at Amazon. And I don't know how many of you know the details of the Google story, but he was one of the first investors in Google and helped Larry and Sergey in the early days really build that company. And so, you know, just perfectly relevant experience from e-commerce to business development to entrepreneurship. And so he's also on the board of Zazzle and he's just incredible. So we did raise money. We raised about $16 million in December of 2004. At the time we were very stealth about it. We were still extremely small and kind of trudging along. So we did not want to blow out a big announcement. So lastly, I just want to point out here that what's really exciting about our investors and their really are, just Zazzle is that they truly are part of the team. And the most common question we hear is, how can we help? What do you need? What can we do? And it's just helped so much. So you know, there are plenty of examples of specific things they've done. We probably don't have to go into those. We probably don't have enough time. But their integral to Zazzle's success. Okay, so last phase, the present. This last year after we raised money, basically what happens is you raise a lot of money and it's like, okay, well, you've done some good things. How do we really amp this up? I mean, two engineers who are e-commerce doesn't really scale to a dramatically large e-commerce website. So basically it's like how fast can you scale? How many people can you hire? What are the right types of people you can bring into your company? And so we sought out to immediately find engineers in addition to marketing people. Okay, we might have a delivery. Is that right? We should let them in. Ah, as soon as, yeah, yeah, come on up. Yeah, thank you, sir. Thanks, this is an example of delighting the customer. We talked about delighting the customer. Actually, it happened too quickly. It was supposed to happen at the end. Yeah, you're too fast, man. This is actually probably a new record. Okay. And then, if you can't see it on the video, we spoke at ETL and all we got was this really super high quality t-shirt. And then this is for the end. So thank you, Jesus. Really quickly rounding this out. So building the team. Now we had to grow fast. However, one of the core tenants was the passion, right? It was the people aspect. That's the most important. So we never recruited an engineer before. It literally took us two months, not because we didn't have candidates in the queue, but it took us two months to finally hire our first engineer, Jason Lee, because we needed to make sure this was the right passion fit, the right technical fit. This person would be really engaged with what we were doing. We turned away great people, just incredibly intelligent people who didn't get it or weren't as excited about the products that we were developing. So I want to story short with Jason in one of the examples here is just that when you hire the best, an amazing thing happens. Other people notice, because they know they're the best. They start asking, what's the deal? Is that a why did you lead this great opportunity to go to this crazy little startup? So anyways, we built the team largely as a part of growing from networks of great people. I think I'm going to breeze past the last two here. One of the big challenges here when we're stuck in the present is there really is a world of opportunity. There's so much creativity out there and it's so untapped. We have resources now. We have great newsazers. We do have some money in the bank. The challenge becomes prioritizing. It becomes balancing the tactical, we need to get stuff done versus maintaining that strategic long-term view of, this is where we want to be, but we got to focus on today in this week. Then meanwhile, you're trying to hire people as fast as you can. So I personally spend about a good 40% of my time purely on recruiting, whether that's sifting through resumes or interviewing or phone screens. And it's just, it's still a big challenge to scale your team. And lastly here, we're really trying to scale our processes as well. When you're just two programmers, we had no process. There was no QA. There was no graphic design. There was no project management. I knew what he was doing, knew what I was doing. It doesn't work when you have a much bigger team. So we're trying to infuse the right structure and process that works with the Zaz away. And lastly here, this is an important point. This goes to questioning everything and learning what you don't know. The prerequisite with every new employee is, and we believe, what can they add in addition to just the pure responsibilities of their job function? We interview everyone after they come and say, hey, what worked for you at your last company? What didn't? What do you think we should do? This is what we're doing. And really trying to learn and pick the best pieces of existing models and processes out there and redefining our own, that's special to Zaz. Okay, so lastly, the present, the people really are the most important thing in the company. And this is just some Zaz's having a good time. This is us launching some new feature late at night, probably 2 a.m., all standing around a computer to release it. Here's some of the more recent Zaz's, John Fogel's on, and Josh Rees right here in the front, Anna Med in the server room. And here's some Zaz's, hanging out after a long night of coding in the bottom, and selling some new servers at the top. Here's some of the investors and other team members like ROM and John and Aileen. So with that, I'm going to pass this back to Bobby, but I do want to talk about the first one again. You must have passion. And this is everything I had at Testimonial, but we don't have time for it. Atimity was basically one of the first guys who contributed to Zaz. And I did all the customer support at the time, insert every email. And he wrote something to the effect of, I can't believe this, but the first time, I have a venue. I have a place to put my art and people are recognizing and seeing it. Thank you so much. Just the gratification he got from having a place to be recognized for his creativity was so impactful. And that's what really drives us. Our users are customers. It's really being connected to those people and making sure that we exceed the expectations. So Bobby, you're up. So I promise at the outset that we like to talk. We talk too long. And I think Jeff might have demonstrated part of that there anyhow. So I'll gloss over these points real quickly. Small teams, we talked about it before. Just to point out some things that weren't evident from the story. Entrepreneurship isn't just about starting the company. You can be entrepreneurial and join a company, take a risk and try and contribute value at any point along the line. And I think these guys up front are a good example of that. They were seniors graduating last year. They're at Zazel now adding tremendous value. John Fogo song basically, Building and Running, a charity program. It's driven tremendous eyeballs to the site. It's also bringing in content and meaningful relationships to Zazel. It's been a huge win. Albert and Josh Reaves. Albert Sue and Josh Reaves. We are product managers now that are helping to drive our product strategy for all of 2006. It's a tremendous responsibility. It's going to dictate our success this year. And these guys, you know, any of these guys could have worked anywhere they wanted to. But they chose to take a risk. Be entrepreneurial. Join Zazel and try to make a difference. Tea basically enabling all of the dark apparel functionality. And Grover being our only QA for about four months, which was painful. We have confidence. I think we've covered that one pretty thoroughly. Question everything. Don't accept the status quo. We certainly didn't. It ended up turning out okay in our case. So we're going to be advocates for it. I'm also going to take the last two. Adapter die. There are a lot of different points. If you guys are curious, you can ask about this one. Come on up and we'll be happy to talk about it afterwards. But there are a lot of different points in our history where it was entirely feasible. The company would end. We had to adapt along the way in order to ultimately succeed. And again, people are the most important thing. I think you've seen that through the pictures that really the focus of this company. And I think any is the people itself. So all that being said, the Zazel way, we've tried to infuse those lessons into how we operate on a daily basis. It's our culture. It's how we live. It dictates the process of things. How we end up trying to make features into, take them to reality. And so these are kind of the values that we live by right now. Innovation. Be a missionary, not a mercenary. If you're out there just to make a buck, you have no place at Zazel for sure. You got to believe in what we're doing. Empowerment. Even in the example of these guys taking a chance, giving them the opportunity to really contribute value. That's how you attract great people is to say, hey, look, you can take ownership of this. We'll let you run with it. We trust you. You're a member of the team. And that's basically been the reason for any and all of our successes. Never settle on anything. I think it's absolutely how we operate. Jeff gave a good example. We've never hired an engineer despite the dire need for one for two months until we really felt like it was the right fit. And then fun. I don't want to give anyone the impression that this is one of these hype companies and every day is a silly string battle. But you got to infuse some fun into what you're doing because it's a tough road. People are working hard and you got to make sure that people are enjoying the ride as they go. So I guess that's about it. I'm not sure we have really any time for questions. You can put your shirt on. One, two. This is a creative 82 who actually did a lot of these posters here and just wanted to leave you with this final thought. It says, imagination, go confidently in the direction of your dreams. So that's our final message. So I think maybe we have time for one question, Tom. So let's see. You right there. And also I'm being told you need to speak into the mic. Yeah. I mean, part of the reason that I graduated in 2000, Jeff in 2001 took us a long time to go live with a public site. And the basic reason was, Jeff and I were slow. I didn't know what the hell we were doing. And in Gene's case, it was a huge R&D project for a long time. And so yes, we came out with a novel printing technology early on. And actually part of this adapt and die message is that the initial efforts we had didn't turn out. We had to use an alternative process to go live with. We ultimately came back to one of our own. But yeah, everything ultimately it's out of the entire marketplace is predicated on the ability to manufacture high quality products with a quick turnaround. And that was the first example. We've since done it with printing posters, prints. We've also done with cards and now finally with stamps. It's kind of what enables everything the average. Eight more questions? Yeah. So we didn't reinvent. So we didn't reinvent an actual inkjet printing machine. Really what we worked on were the ink chemistries to actually develop dyes that could get through nozzle heads without clogging them and then ultimately finding a way to set that so that it didn't wash out. In the case of the other stuff, we run machines that anybody can buy. We modify them pretty dramatically for our usage. So the machines we run generally don't turn off. They run 24 hours a day in order to drive huge throughput and to drive the cost down. Do. Okay. One more question. All right. Do you have any plans on going to have reading orders such as mock eos or small, small burden, like that providing the faster? That's great. Okay. Well, the question was about going to brick and mortar and potentially going retail on small locations. Good question. I can't really give you any insight into future plans because we're still private, but it's something, you know, let's come up. Think about. The thing I would say is that, you know, as we continue to attract established content like museums, like Hoover or MoMA or Disney or whatever, these are guys that have content and also have physical locations. And one of our biggest challenges generally is to show people the quality of the products we produce. It's really hard on the web to display how high quality this is. So the reason we really like the notion of physical presences is that that would afford us an opportunity to get samples out there together with the content. So absolutely, we're keeping that in mind. Definitely. Okay. The last one. Okay. So the question was about the loyalty model and what the average artist makes on the site. So to the latter, it really varies greatly depending on, you know, the content and how much traffic that individual might drive. The fundamental system right now is a 10% royalty model and a 7% referral. So the referral is, if you actually direct using one of our links, somebody to content on the site. So 17% combined. So I think that's it. Thank you so much for having us. And we're sticking around after two. We'll be hanging out for as long as you guys want to stay if you have more questions. On behalf of the class and STVP in basis, we'd like to thank Jeff and Bobby Beaver for joining us today. Thank you. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.
