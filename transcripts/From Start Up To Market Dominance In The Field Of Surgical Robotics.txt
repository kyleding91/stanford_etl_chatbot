 Let me take you through just a little bit of history. This technology actually came out of Stanford Research and a fellow named Fred Mall who was a general surgeon from the University of Washington. It always started two companies and was down here and was working as the chief medical officer for guidance. And he saw the technology over at Stanford Research. And it was then that thought was as it would be used for tele surgery or for surgeons to be in a safe zone operating on soldiers in the battlefield. You thought that was a pretty lousy idea, but it was intrigued with the idea that he could separate the surgeon's hand from the tip of the instrument. And so he and a fellow named Rob Younghood founded AccuSon, as an engineer from Stanford, began the company and that began in early 1996, really, late 1995. And what you saw, that picture was actually one of our late prototypes. You can see the covers weren't on it and there were some things. But that's what you do when you're trying to move as quickly as you can and raise money and keep the thing float. Anyway, they licensed the technology out of SRI. And the first machine out of SRI was called Lenny, after Leonardo da Vinci. And so the first thing was to have no articulating instruments and a set up was kind of screwy and no 3D vision. And so we began developing something called Mona after Mona Lisa. So the engineers name everything. If you go into our offices, all the conference rooms are named after scientists and innovators. Anyway, in March, which is just a little after I joined the company, we did our first human trials over in Gint, Belgium. And we just did some simple procedures, lab colleagues, which is removing the gallbladder, nison-fundubication, where you wrap the stomach around the softener for softener georeflux. And we began to suture vessels together openly just to see how we handle small structures. What we really found out is set up as lousy, the vision was terrible, and there were a lot of things that we needed to improve. So we came back and began working on the first da Vinci prototype. Morton was not really the name of the system as John described it. Anyway, in about 98, we did our first coronary audit bypass. Did that. In two places, almost the same day, we did it in hospital Bruce Say, in Paris, and in Lipsig, Germany, both big heart centers. In the end of 98, we shipped our first system to Lipsig, Germany, and began selling in Europe. And 99 was really first year we generated much revenue. And we generated, so did we sell 10 systems, sell they worked, we didn't go out out there that we had to take back, and did about 10 million revenue. In 2000, there was something called heart port here that was doing, extensively, was a high flying company was going to do close chest coronary audit bypass. And we got in trouble. First, I mean, we had a market cap of $1 billion, one point in time. They were flying high, but the technology didn't work very well. But they had a lot of great patents, and some that could block us from doing close chest coronary audit bypass. So before they actually got bought by Johnson and Johnson, we licensed their technology for robotic surgery. And in June, did our first public offering. We thought we'd have FDA approval. We've been going through that process, but we didn't. And so as always, things work out in July, we got FDA approval. So all on the road show, we're telling people, it's in the mail. Anyway, so the second year we did about 26 million sales. In 2001, we got our first thoracoscopic approval. That's operated in the chest. And our first prostatectomy approval, which is allow us to do radical prostatectomy to remove the prostate for cancer. And we started developing some five millimeter instruments. We did the first 100 the ventric prostatectomies. Now that's a big deal because that was our first killer app. Now you'll find in the valley that people talk about a technology looking for an application, and they kind of do that in a kind of a... So it's not always a compliment. But every really breakthrough technology is exactly that. And if it doesn't find that application, it fails. And if it does, it succeeds. Well, our first one, we did 100 DVPs and the ventric prostatectomies and began our mitrovalf, an atroceptive defect, which are both cardiac procedures where you close a hole in between the chambers of the heart and did about 56 million revenue. Still losing a lot of money, about 20 million a year. We were pretty good at that. Mitrovalf clearance came in 2002. As only technologies, this was a year that we really made some really dramatic improvements in terms of reliability of the system. We've been working on it and it had been coming all along that some huge steps there. And a hospital in Detroit, Henry Ford Hospital, published their data on the ventric prostatectomies. I'll share that with you in a little bit. And that stirred a lot of things. And we began to see that we were on an adoption curve. One way could quantify and measure. And we did about 72 million. Then in 2003, we actually got our first cardiac approval for atroceptive defect repair. And I'll actually aid Mitrovalf before. We got atroceptive defect repair. We put a fourth arm on the system. This was so the surgeon could self assist so that in the taking arm, they could position some tissue, retract it, and then operate. And we turned profitable in quarter 2004, or three in the second quarter. And then we acquired our competitor. We were in a huge patent battle. Neither one of us giving in ground. We'd won in Delaware. We were out to go down in LA. And both of us, both companies stock was embarrassing low. And we had a lot of, we had money and we were in survive. Looks like they would go broke. On other hand, they might bring us down the process. So I swole my pride. We acquired them. And then we did a secondary offering to make sure we had enough money to make it through. We actually shouldn't have ever done that, but we did. And we did about 92 million. And then, this last year in 2004, we actually got cornea already bypass approval. This is to do a cardiac bypass and a broad urology claim. And approval for ablation of the heart for something called atrial fibrillation. This is when the heart beats uncontrollably. And you blight it to cut off the electrical signals. We developed some more instruments and we fully were fully your profitability and did about 138. So this is what our growth trends looks like in terms of revenue. We were growing about 70, little over 70%, a year. We'll do something over 200 million this year. There are two components of our model. We sell systems and they sell for about a million dollars, maybe a little more. And then we sell instruments. And these instruments can be used 10 times and then they shut off. They have a Dallas chip in them. So it counts usages. And so we have an ongoing revenue stream. And you can see at the beginning, we had no recurring revenue. And here recurring revenue is about 40. I guess last year was probably 37%. This year it's running 46% of our total revenue. That's important because hospitals or high cost to serve markets. And you need a recurring revenue to continue to serve them. Now, let me talk a little bit about how technology like this gets adopted. What we're trying to do is replace traditional surgery, right? Either laparoscopic or over surgery. And the model I use is a diffusion model, where a substitution process where something spreads through an existing population or medium. And there are two variables, those that have it and those that don't. And you see color TV, cell phones. When I was at the Boston Consulting Group, I did a lot of this work in terms of adoption curves. And all these centers have a common is that the innovation of the disease is spread by contact. I mean, it's word of mouth. So the susceptible or uninfected become infected. And who will call them those are the adopters. So it's just kind of a viral phenomenon. And the more doctors are, the faster the spread is of the technology. And what it tends to be is, tends to be very competitive. This guy who says, it won't work or why would you do it? With the traditional against the new technology, one substitution is progressed a few percent, typically. It will displace ultimately. And it sometimes takes 20 years and this used to drive some of the people nuts. When I tell them the full adopts in this technology will take 20 or 30 years, that didn't go down with well with Wall Street. And so they weren't, they thought I was a little too pessimistic. The rate of substitution proportional to the remaining market. And the mathematical equation, which you all recognize, is just a differential equation. And what comes down to is it's proportional to where F is the share of the new product. And one minus F is the remaining market share. And so as the new product becomes larger, there's a larger interface. It grows. And ultimately, when it starts to displace it, pretty soon the remaining market becomes smaller. It slows down and you get an S-A curve of one technology replacing the other. And you're going to say, well, why is this important? Because I'll show you in a minute what our curve looks like for a specific procedure. Initially, the whole technology has the advantage. Why it's more reliable, you know, the technology that it's well known, well understood. There's plenty of service technicians around. It's reliable. And, but as initial problems are solved, of course, it becomes, it begins to replace, begins to substitute for the other. New technology adoption typically occurs application by application. It doesn't just kind of, and it usually finds an application that the other technology does not serve well. And usually when it's not a very attractive to the current provider. So it's usually a small, typically small niche. And in surgery, it actually occurs, surgical procedure by surgical procedure, because they're quite different. And so, you know, it looks like this. You probably all seen this, you know, Jeff Moore wrote the book, Crossing the Casm. It starts out with innovators. Those guys are easy to sell, but it's hard to maintain their attention. The early adopters come along. They're willing to tolerate a lot of, a fair amount of fiddle factor inconvenience. And their attention is a little, a little earlier, a little better, but they're always looking at the next thing. And then you begin to use it in the early majority, and they, they won't tolerate much. I mean, they want it to be as fast. They just will not tolerate much fiddle factor. And then only you get to the late majority, and finally, the laggards who come kicking and screaming only because they can't do it the old way. It's no longer available. There's a surgeon in Atlanta, a cardiac surgeon, who says the value of a procedure to a patient is equal to the efficacy of the procedure divided by its invasiveness, perhaps, square. Now, cardiac surgeons have kind of discovered that the hard way, because the cardiologist has taken their business with stats. And so if you think about that, you know, and would, if you have a disease, you can take a pill, that would be great. If you, you know, you will gradually go up to the more invasive procedure as necessary, but you're certainly not going to do it at first. So the comfort zone is over in the far upper left-hand quarter, right? High efficacy, low invasiveness. That's where we want to be. Now, if I took the procedure that we've been highly successful at, it would be the open-prostatectomy. And you see it's over here on the right. It's quite effective, but it's, it's very invasive. There's an incision from your, your pubis to your melacus. You have to go in and cut to your ether, take out the prostate, and so the ether back together. Now, another option for treatment prostate cancer is, is radioactive seeds. Another is hormonal treatment. And the last is watchful waiting. If you're old enough, you figure you'll outlast it. You're going to die of something else. You don't have anything done. But you can see there's, there's literally a continuum here. Now, Henry Ford, when they published their data, here's what he said. He said, you know, let me poll the patients and see what they're looking for. And what are the priorities of the patient? And the first thing was cancer removal. The second was continents that they wouldn't have to wear a diaper, that the urinary, have urinary accounts. Third is potency. They'd like to have sexual intercourse. Ford, they'd like it to be safe. Five, a quick recuperation and six, no blood loss or a limited blood loss. So he then compared his data with his open procedures. So Dr. Manon, who's the chief of urology at Henry Ford, he found that, you know, a cancer immediately did a lot better job. And this is, this is negative margins, which means that there was no cancer. And so he had 94% versus 76 in open procedure. In terms of continents, after six months, he had 60% in open procedure, but 96% with our system. And in terms of sexual potency, it doubled from 33% to 66% in six months. And safety, he had 2% complications versus 15% complications. The pain score was much lower. And there were no blood transfusions versus about 11%. So, you know, it's pretty good. Now he said, you know, hey, you can argue that I'm a lousy surgeon. So then he did, as he said, let me compare that with the best in class. So we went through all the industry and said, who's the best? And whatever the published data was, he was actually better except for one paper that showed that they claimed that they had 98% negative margins. Now, so what did we do? So what did that really do? That moved us up and to the left, right? So we moved open prosthetic me up and to the left, exactly where the consumer would prefer it. And we do access seats. And we thought we were taking open seizures and converting those patients over. But it turns out, when I start talking to docs, that we're getting a lot of the seats patients, because they were very, very conscious of, they wanted a minimally invasive procedure. And now there was one that was more effective. And actually, probably less painful than seats. This is just an example of a patient. A little. Can you hear it? Oh. Oh. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. That is how we do it. That is how we do it. That is how we do it. You have to do a lot. You have to do it. You have to do it. You have to do it. You have to do it. You have to do it. You have to do it. You have to do it. You have to do it. You have to do it. You have to do it. You have to do it. You have to do it. That was really good. It was really good. It was really good. It was really good. It was really good. The only time that I was out when we went out, we used the clock thing in the virus. In the end, I was in the first place. You know, this time, we were in the 20s last year. So, it was so frequent. So, that, I can't get this game alone. I'm afraid that it would be like this. You know, I'm calling the bendies. So, I'm going to use this clock thing. I was possible to go there and have that. I was standing there, really fast. That was my handle. That's what I was thinking. That's what I was thinking. The only time that I was out, I was out for a lot of service. I was out for a lot of service. I was out for a lot of service. I was out for a lot of service. I was out for a lot of service. I was out for a lot of service. I was out for a lot of service. I was out for a lot of service. I was out for a lot of service. I was out for a lot of service. I was out for a lot of service. I was out for a lot of service. I was out for a lot of service. I was out for a lot of service. I was out for a lot of service. I was out for a lot of service. you would go out there, out there, away from any kind of service. I used to do all nine. Didn't you you use, didn't you use the game of yours? No, you used it too quick. Last time, you used the game of yours. You knew your product down here again. You used it from every landing place around you. You used the game of yours. You used to go out for a lot of service. It was all July, This is a lot of loss. You used itDid you have some累 dirr what? I used to do it again. I was out for a lot of service. It was only after that. It was a lot of service. We used it. I used it again. on a log scale, semi log scale, this is the curve. And you can see it's got an R-scared of about almost 0.99. So pretty predictable, right? And of course, what that translates into, if you put it onto a radar, is this curve. So we're right on it. And this is where we at this point, we just started in March of it. We'll do about 20% of all prostitectomies done in this country this year. So now that's the start, right? This is a picture of cardiac. We've got one procedure. You've got one killer app. OK, that's great. We've got to drive that to 100%. And now we've got to find the others. This is a patient with having an open heart surgery. And on the floor right, you see some with a mean astronomy where they're cut from here to here. You saw the breastbone open. And then you wire it shut. With the system, they moved to first to a minithor economy where they do a little incision under the breast. And then spread the ribs. But that's pretty painful as well. And then this last one is what you see done when they do a fully endoscopic procedure with the system. And through just a few small holes. So, you see the result. And you still have a help with the endoscopic. There's no right that you want to go back to vigorously. And with the camera, the endoscopic here. Let's have a little up here, right out here. And then right here, before we have small sitting where we can pass through here back and forth. Kind of move around a little bit. And when you get through here, you're ready to move. So yeah, we're going to move. We're going to have to stay there. We're going to go. Yeah. But 10 in the first year, we have very good long-awesome there. So that's going to be a good day. It's amazing when you're swinging back and through. There's a lot of us who have been meaning this. Just sort of obvious when you get here. So, you know, the docs that don't believe it, that's fine. Because the patients do. And with internet, what do they do? You have a family member that becomes sick. Somebody's going to Google it, right? And before law, you get to some solution. I just, as I was leaving the office to that, ran out of meeting, checked my email, and somebody sent me this picture of a surgeon. This guy just had bypass in Virginia. And he sent it through his dock six days out after coronary bypass using a football game. This is a woman who's had a history to see. Can you just tell if you were in a flashback I'm not going to have to go back to the other day. I'm going to have to go back to the other day. I'm going to have to go back to the other day. I'm going to have to go back to the other day. I'm going to have to go back to the other day. I'm going to have to go back to the other day. I'm going to have to go back to the other day. I'm going to have to go back to the other day. I'm going to have to go back to the other day. I'm going to have to go back to the other day. I'm going to have to go back to the other day. I'm going to have to go back to the other day. I'm going to have to go back to the other day. I'm going to have to go back to the other day. I'm going to have to go back to the other day. So, the dodging curve, the broader dodging curves, there is something over 20 or 30 years. But it curves with a bunch of individual curves, prostitutectomy first. Then perhaps hysterectomy, cardiac, et cetera. that, until you drive the whole curve. Just a quick understanding of where we might be going or we are going with it. You've now got the search and sitting at a console, right? And in a cockpit, now we can deliver all kinds of things to them. One, we can do tell operation, which we're doing now. So the search and sits at console operates on the patient. We can do training simulation. We now we can duplicate exactly what they're doing. And measure every hand of it. Now some surgeons think that's a good idea. And something that's a pretty lousy idea. But we can move right now. Right now, Fred Moll used to say that surgery, surgical training, was like the penal system. It was measured in time. You did your time. You became a surgeon. There is no real standard to measure the capability of a surgeon. This technology ultimately may lead us there. Now, lots of hurdles between now and then. But I think we'd all be happier if we knew the surgeon had the kind of dexterity and the capability we needed. We do preoperative planning. And I'm not going to show you all of it. Where literally, you can do an MRI of the patient, scan of the patient, and preoperative planning, even go through the procedure on a morphed model before you enter into it, especially if there's some serious complications. Connectivity, we use tiling. And so we can bring all kinds of information right into the cockpit, a kind of a head display from everything from other images to a preoperative plan to vital statistics. Augmented reality, we can highlight areas. We could create no fly zones or force fields, if you want. Where, in fact, there are things we do not want the surgeon to touch. It might be a cystic dump or optic nerve. And we just before the procedure, the surgeon just paints that out and no longer can he enter that field. And we will do telemetry. And one of the biggest issues we have at training is the surgeons doing their first or second case, and they need to have another surgeon there. That means the surgeon has to leave his or her practice. Fly there, spend the day, fly back, and they've lost the revenue from that. Of course, they're paid to do it. But there's a lot of wear and tear on that. So this is an old old picture. I think we have three, as of the end of last quarter, I think we had 354, 384. I'm going to make which. But nearly 400 systems installed worldwide. And there's advantage to that. Again, a first-mover advantage is, once we've got those installed, we can think about how do we network them? Usually, neither are fiber optics or are low-robedding satellites if and when they come in reality. But it means that you have a surgeon in a parallel to. And he or she is doing a procedure they've never done before. They can contact someone in Chicago or assist someone in Chicago. And we've done this. We've done it with Army. And we've done it on animals back and forth just to see how it works. New York City, Paris. But the fact is, over time, you can create a network where any surgeon call someone else and say, just sit there. I'm about to do this procedure. Could you assist me? Could you be there? And all I have to do is sit down and consult. They have an extra console or they use their console. It's not being used. And so a longer term where we're going is a DaVinci surgical network and a lot of other things. But all of a sudden, as these technologies become available, we start to bring together a whole different way of doing it. And you've got to ask yourself, why would you do it with large instruments through a large incision, longer term? And will that happen today, no? But in 20 or 30 years, probably at the time of your running companies or doing great things, you just won't even consider going and having surgery done with somebody's shaky hand through a large incision. Anyway, that's kind of a story of where we're at. I'd be happy to answer any questions. Hi. I'm really a two-barcliffe, sort of related, first of all. You know, certain, very protective of what they do. I wonder what the American, I want to search other life bodies that are reactivated, sort of taking the arts and the skill of making it more technical, making sort of, I don't know, a four-cliffe operator for a certain kind of reactivated, or that, whether it's also, you thought about maybe pushing this in to the residency program, just to really get the next generation of surgeons on top of it, it's harder probably for later stages that are going to suit that. We say it's all true. And it's not really age-based, but it is in a way. It's mental age, at least attitude. Older surgeons with large practices really don't want to get out of their comfort zone. Young surgeons are very interested. But sometimes surgeons, many men and who is doing like six prostatectomies a day with the system is probably in his early 50s. So it varies. The American College of Surgeons, I don't know that they, we're at that show. It's not a particularly big show for us. I mean, it's a big surgery show, but it's primarily general surgery. And as I said before, you know, technology needs to find an application. General surgeons are a good example, but you're saying. Most of them are laparoscopically trained now. They weren't in the late 80s, but they've spent the last 10 or 15 years learning to operate with these long sticks, where you move left. Tim was right, you move up and moves down. But they got pretty good at it. Doing certain procedures, like mostly procedures where you're just removing an organ, where there's not a lot of reconstruction. And they're very threatened. I mean, I remember being in St. Louis at one of the meetings and a young surgeon coming up and looking at it, trying to out and saying, I just spent seven years of my life learning to do what I do. And now that guy, not the forklift operator, but the guard at the door, can do it. Now that's not quite true. But what we do is, I don't have you read the book, Earth is Flatter, which is kind of a hot book now. But we have leveled the playing field. There's no question about that. And that's something that goes on all the time. And those, as in any situation, those that are benefiting from the status quo don't want it to change. And those that have something to gain do. And what we have is young surgeon, I'll give you an example. Young surgeon, who trained at Henry Ford, is now Cornell. Cornell is paying for the education of all of his kids. He's a full professor. And he's just a few years out of his fellowship. Another one took his first job out of his fellowship by asking him, how many prostate patients he did before he had used the adventure system? He looked at me like, it was really stupid question. I said, well, I was just trying to understand what being able to do it through small incisions did for your practice. He said, I didn't do any. I just came up my fellowship and went to a community hospital. Vincent's down in Birmingham, Alabama. And he just went to Ohio State as a full professor. And they had to change the bylaws the university of paying enough to get him. And so those people are very arrest. And the more people who see that model are very interested in following it. Any other questions? I'm a professor of creative law philosophy to talk about disability. Thanks for the exact question. One question I have, and I'm actually a robot. I was a student in robotics. And that's one of the years ago when I was in my pilot's program, the robot is a two-lane university. I asked my wife, do I possibly be a medical robot? And instead of being financially not feasible, because I actually seriously need to be an asset of legal innovation that's being a possibility. Are these really risks and how do you might have the public as a drug provider? Well, you know, the first design priority is safety. And so everything we've done is failsafe. I mean, it's trying to make the systems failsafe as possible. And I'd say the engineers are not usually really aggressive. They're very conservative. And when it comes to this, you know, a surgeon can slip with a knife much more easily than the system can screw up. But so the damage we have had in a patient's center, but never with the system. It's always been surgeon error. Or it's often, once you've got the big policy, I mean, when the robot wasn't even around. But if a robot was used, it hits the front page of the newspaper, right? I mean, it's big news. And you've got a situation where you've got lots of lawyers out there who are plaintiffs' lawyers, who will chase these things. We have had very little litigation, almost none. But we have had a, nobody's coming after us. We've had no, I would say, this point no litigation. I have one where somebody's just raised and wants to talk to our insurance because we had a system error. And the patient had to have a large incision. And therefore it was our fault. And so, you know, I don't where that will go. It's some sort of settlement probably. But, you know, malpractice insurance and litigation is a serious medical cost. No doubt about it. And, you know, and technology, anything that's highly visible draws flies. You mentioned that there is a recurrence between the possibility of the implementation. What is the database in the quality of the application? OK. Good question. Oh, these instruments are cabled rhythm. So you have high tension cables over very small poise. Most of you understand that that causes wear. And so we've had a, we, in fact, that has been one of the major engineering challenges is to try to get the lives as long as we can get them. Now, different instruments, depending on how much forces exerted on them, have different lives. But part of it was is to make it economically feasible as a company. I mean, viable as a company because, you know, one of our competitors, the one that failed, had very little recurring revenue stream, almost none. And the sad thing about it is, is, is, is, is, is, and it's just true. The medical community is a very high cost because of all the training, all the things you need to do to keep it going. And so it was part of our business model as well. But it is a technical reality. Now, we don't have it, you know, it, you know, something that's used a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, scuffle usually uses its edge before the cables will wear out. But, uh, but a grasper, uh, and, and some of our power instruments, uh, you know, we, we've actually, it's, it's been a, it's stressed to get 10, 10 uses out of them. And, and of course, we always want some safety. But that's been a, that has been our big, when I talked about a big gain in, in reliability, which primarily instruments, in the life of the instruments. We throw up far end. What do you guys, I probably mean, with that, uh, video capture, and that's what I did in my, the kind of, the, of the, of the, the, and the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, uh, good question. Um, uh, hospitals have always had the ability to, uh, to capture on video, um, the procedures. They, they, they, you know, I, I, I, if that's, if they're doing laparoscopic, because you have a camera, you have a video recorder. Um, hospitals don't always record. I mean, we, we, we have, on our logs, every motion that the system made in any faults. And so we can go, we can go back to, to, to that, and we know exactly what it did. What, when instruments were changed, all that sort of thing. Um, but they don't, you know, and in fact, we just had a discussion. One of my board members was saying, you know, I just don't understand why surgeons wouldn't record every procedure. Well, I guess it depends on a good assurgeon you are. Uh, but, you know, but I haven't seen that as, um, as, as a major issue, but it certainly is something that, um, in discovery, if, if you recorded the, the procedure, you would, you know, it would be something that would be discoverable. And I actually would think it would, for, for most surgeons, you, that would be a good thing to have. If, in fact, you're not a, not a cowboy, and there are surgeons, they're cowboys. So you spoke about, uh, driving an addiction, um, You know, if you're CEO, at SIGO, this question is not about this. Thank you. So myając they're all sexy right now. So my first suggestion is, yeah. I think a lot of people would like to talk about the picture that they want to have in the book. But I think it's going to be a little bit more representative. Because they would design and they would post how things, or whether or not they're actually going to give us the position to work here, what kind of things do you address? Well, you're right. There's two sides of any adoption curve, right? And so you've got to, and this is, on the demand side, it's probably a word of mouth. We've used, you know, certainly we used the internet. There are webcasts of procedures that major universities or major hospitals webcasts a procedure. And so, you know, you can watch it. People who are, you know, have a problem. And, you know, the patients, the early adopter, disease states, we best address, or ones where you have a little time, right? Where the patient can research it, or somebody can research their options for them. I had a, but you know, it's amazing, especially with prostate cancer, because this is, occurs in a certain age of man, right? And these people talk, I was at AC at the Immuriculgia Surgeons, two weeks ago in San Francisco, and a VC, I've known for a long time, I've been on sports with, came up to me and said, why, you know, he didn't invest, by the way. You know, I've just had a real visible experience with your system. He says, you know, the guy across the street had, just had a prostatectomy, and he's still laid up for about, you know, it's been over a month. The guy next door to me had one about 12 months ago, and he went down to Southern California and had it done with your system, and he was in his garden the next day. And he says, and those stories get told over and over again, but we use hospitals' advertised, they use billboards, they use TV, the technology, you know, in 98, we're in 2000, we're on the cover of Life Magazine, a medical miracle, so the next millennium. We don't have a problem getting, getting lots of coverage, but hospitals, we encourage them to propose the procedure. Docs will have seminars where patients can come and understand the data, but there's a lot of work we're doing, and primarily on kind of viral marketing techniques, but the internet is the most powerful tool we have. And they're going to be used for a couple of things. One, we have it for patient-facing websites, but we also have surgeon-facing websites, so, you know, trying to give them the latest techniques and training videos and training instructions. Can you talk about why we started using the blockchain to deliver the first hand? And the technology is just a little bit regulated. Yeah, I mean, getting a CMARC is a lot easier than getting through the FDA. And this was new technology, and it was pretty well wrought quite frankly. We went to the agency very early. And we got approval to hold blend instruments, not to do surgery, but to do assisting very quickly. But as soon as we wanted to do surgery, we were trying to avoid having to do a procedure by procedure. But the agency couldn't decide, there's two routes you can take through the FDA. One is called a PMA, pre-market approval. The one thing that causes a lot of barriers for anybody to follow you, but it also means any time you change the system, you've got to go through the whole process again. It's a killer. All drugs go through a PMA process. The other one is called a 510K clearance, which is a simpler process. Well, the agency couldn't decide which one it was, whether it was a PMA or a fat 510K. So we treated it as a PMA. So we had to do trials. The trials in Europe, we could do easily, and they were easy to do, first human trials. When we actually did our clinical trials, we used European U.S. surgeons, but we actually did it for miss on for duplications, which is to treat gourd. And no many doctors do a lot of those, and we had to do a lot. We didn't do it in Mexico, because the diet, and so patients got free miss on for duplications, and we got data to go to the agency. But almost always you go to Europe first. It's just a more friendly regulatory environment. I think this fellow right here was... I think that people thought that I'm looking on that, that it's a typical disaster case. And I was just wondering if this is something that we used to get freedom or to not be a part of it. Well, we had fair number of systems in New Orleans that there was no power. And at least one of them got it was on the first floor, which wasn't a good place to be. So no, we haven't. And we haven't used them in any disaster situations at this point in time. What's that? Community motion? I have to question that personally, the community could be doing it very well. Well, the community motion was a disaster. What is the basic question for that? Do you receive the computer and what is your idea? What is the same question? Good question. Good question. Well, you know, this is an... Any of you read the book The Innovators Dilemma by Christensen from Harvard or The Innovators Solution? Well, this is a perfect example of that. Computer motion, first product, was a device that controlled an endoscope. It was actually manually, you know, by foot control, and then went to voice control. So they were working with laparoscopic surgeons. Okay, these are already trying to use the sticks. So they went to them, a very ill and wrong, a very good robotics engineer, went to them to ask them what he should build. And what do you think they told it? Do it the way I do it? Do you need wrist on your instruments? You don't need wrist on your instruments. I didn't use wrist for my instruments. Do you need 3D? No, you don't need 3D. You don't need those things. Because I can do those things. And so they were replicated with robotics what the surgeon was already doing. And what value is that? They didn't take it any further. And last of all, they didn't have any kind of ongoing revenue stream. So actually it was really...it was our competition. They promised a lot, but delivered very little. And so we outsold them dramatically because we went to the surgeons who couldn't do laparoscopic surgery. And we said, what can we do to help you do that? Now, where will our competition come from? Where do you think it will come from? Never. Our company's don't do breakthrough technology. Where do you think it will come from? Start up. Start up? Well, some startups perhaps. Yeah, it may come from the lower end. There are some startups trying to do some things that have been really struggling but have tried to do articulating instruments manually. Actually, Japan. Japan has got a huge robotics initiative. And they're coming. Now, we've got 200 and some patents already. And one of the wonderful...the dilemma being first, the challenge being first, you've got lots of hard problems to solve. The advantage of being first, you've got a lot of hard problems to solve. And you patent. And so we will be battling. We can see them coming. We're ready. Dr. Talk about how to get back and smell the important things you're going to work also on. Actually, I had a lot of money. So, how to get back and see your time lag and first, you do that. So, how to fix and time lag? And smell. I've never heard Dr. Stays smell was important. And that was a big issue initially. And we put a lot of money into the system at that stage. And quite frankly, we lost most of the mechanical inefficiencies coming back. So, how are we created what we've got, sensors, tens of our fingers? But what we've found is that with 3D high precision, 3D vision, the surgeon pretty quickly adapts really fast. And they can see the tension of the tissue. And as they see the tension of the tissue, they pretty have pretty good idea of how much, you know, what's going on. And pretty soon they think they can feel it. And in fact, I just came out of a meeting of haptics. And where we rank haptics. And clearly, the technology is improving. Thin film, sensors, there's some good stuff with optics and things that can give us. And we're going to continue driving. But quite frankly, we don't think it is at this point in time is not, it's something we'll need if the competition offers it. But it's not something we believe will bring a significant advantage. Where it comes in advantage is when you're trying to pull a vessel to find out, you know, how calcified, where's a good spot to do the NASA Moses? We can also do that with ultrasound though, and other probes. So, we always get that from a non-user. I always get a, that question about haptics, for a certain sort of so, you have to have haptics. I've got to have a sense of feel. And I'll say, have you ever used a system that go, well no. And if I talk to some of these using a system, what? They'll say, don't waste your time. So, it's going to be interesting. Now, the second question on time delay, and that clearly is an issue. We have, you know, a couple of things, you know, you know, we've got one thing good about the internet bubble, was we've laid a lot of pipes, right? Now, those pipes are big pipes. The only thing that control is the through-through with those pipes is switching, right? Optical switching. And the wonderful thing about optical switching, if the tonics, is it's doubling about every nine to 12 months. So, you know, we're seeing great improvements in switching, and therefore great improvements in bandwidth. So, you know, it depends on just how much you want to spend. But what we found is we can get it down to, even under current ISD lines of things, down to, you know, a few milliseconds. And, you know, there's a lie where people are in comfort. It depends on what you're doing, what procedure you're doing. But we're not going to start out with tele surgery. We're in hell with mentoring, helping and assisting, because one, I'm not sure there's a great story at this point in time. There will be at some point in time of tele surgery. I think if you can afford a million dollars system, you can afford a surgeon. But there's a lot of advantage for training and teaching. And that's where we'll start. And there, and there's the time delay is not an issue. Last question. Okay. We haven't heard from a lady. I mean, talk about the occasion. Tell you who can come much more efficiently. And, as an international component to greater than two surgery in general, how is that, how do you think the clinical upon? Well, it's a good question. Some hospitals, like Henry Ford, literally stopped taking initially. He just said, we're not going to take a surgeon. Sure, you can worry about your insurance, and it's $10,000. And you know what? Patients were willing to pay that. But I don't think that long-term is the solution. Technology like this always starts out more expensive. I almost say anything, whether you're talking about a plasma screen TV, or whatever, always starts out more expensive. But as volume builds, it becomes less expensive. To the degree we can reduce complications, which is a huge cost, shorten surgery time. And if you want to talk about the broader economics, get the person back to work quickly. You know, it becomes productive in society. You know, the problem with our whole medical cost system, and the way we measure it, we compartmentalize everything. And so, we don't optimize anything. It's very unoptimized system. But right now, the recovery surgery is more expensive. Will it be 10 years from now? I expect it will not. And even today, actually today, major centers that do a lot of it say they're cost are lower. Well, thanks, that's fabulous. Thank you.
