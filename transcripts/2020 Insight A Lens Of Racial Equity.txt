 Hello ETL fans! My name is Chuck Easley, Associate Professor at Stanford University, and I'm here to continue our special ETL mini-series that is capping off a truly unique year. 2020 has defied all our expectations. From the challenges posed by the pandemic, to the murders of black Americans like George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, our personal and professional lives have been disrupted. But the entrepreneurs and innovators who visited ETL this year also brought us weekly lessons on how to find agency and act positively in times of crisis and uncertainty. Today, I'm sharing my key takeaway from our 2020 ETL talks. If entrepreneurs take away one lesson from this year, it's that we all have a unique responsibility and an opportunity to create more diverse, inclusive and equitable startups, and an ecosystem for tacking entrepreneurship that is diverse and inclusive. Nothing exemplifies this more than what Rodney Samson from OHUB said at ETL in November of 2020. In this clip, let's have a listen to how he approached anti-racist entrepreneurship. So I want to encourage you to be a different type of entrepreneur and to really think about everything through an anti-racist lens, a lens of racial equity. Nothing in America that has been achieved as it relates to the emancipation of child slaves, to demolition of Jim Crow, to unfair housing, unjust education, and now access to economic opportunity has been done in this country without white allies. And those of us who live longer enough, I'm part of the Fubu tribe too, for us by us. I grew up in Black Atlanta. Everything I saw that was inspiration to me growing up in Atlanta was black. And when I got to Tulane as an undergraduate, it was a shock to then, it was a culture shock to then have to learn how to vibe with my Jewish brothers and sisters, and with my Latinx brothers and sisters, my white brothers and sisters. But I grew up in Atlanta seeing black excellence. And what I want to encourage you all to do is since you're at this age where you are pre-career, many of you in your respective lives is to become that ally. Now that means you're going to have to do some work. It's okay to read all the books, read all the articles. That's a part of the work, but actually being uncomfortable to exist in black spaces, bring value, listen, never see yourself with a savior complex, come to learn and understand that we are here to build and we might as well be building together. I want to see you all as the future allies. I want to see you on cap tables. I want to see you as technical co-founders. I want to see you as visors. I want to see you make introductions. And what I want you to do is make sure that you become colleagues and associates with your black and brown students on campus. All right, you on the path to being woke now. So you're going to have to light embrace it and be responsible for this conversation we're having today. Rodney Samson is right. White allies have a key role to play and it begins with learning more and educating oneself with the skills and frameworks for how to create an inclusive startup culture with a diverse set of co-founders, early employees and advisors. To learn more about diversity, equity and inclusion in the context of entrepreneurship, check out Rodney's full ETL talk in which he joins Jessica Norwood founder of Runway to talk about anti-racist entrepreneurship. I also recommend taking a look at the Runway and O-Hub websites as well as the 2019 guide building inclusive entrepreneurship ecosystems and communities of color and the O-Hub course outline. We will also include these links in the show notes on e-corner. Join us for our next mini episode of ETL. One another one of my colleagues will share their top 2020 takeaways. The entrepreneurial thought leaders is a Stanford e-corner original series produced by the Stanford Technology Ventures program in Stanford's Department of Management Science and Engineering.
