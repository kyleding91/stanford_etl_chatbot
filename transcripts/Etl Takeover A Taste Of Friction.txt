 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these elections online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Hi everyone, I'm Matt Harvey, a member of the Stanford E-Corner team. We know it's a long hot summer waiting for new episodes of the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. So today we thought we'd bring you a taste of something a little different. The Friction Podcast is the newest offering from eCorner and features Stanford Engineering Professor Bob Sutton. Bob's a New York Times bestselling author of such titles as Scaling Up Excellence, The No Asshole Rule, and the upcoming The Asshole Survival Guide. In this podcast, Bob brings in venture capitalists, technology leaders, and world-class researchers to discuss organizational friction. Friction is that drag, that feeling of walking in the muck that slows down teams and organizations and can even cause them to fail. If you've ever felt it, you know what we're talking about. Each episode features raw, hilarious stories from the front lines of work. Now, you may not want to listen to this with kids in the car, but it might give you some ideas on how to deal with a micromanaging boss or a co-worker that seems entirely focused on making your life difficult. If you enjoy this episode, subscribe to the podcast and rate and review it on iTunes. And now, the Friction Podcast. It's not anything you write down on this slide. That's what you do. And I hold my CEO's little faces in my hands, and I look them in the eyes, and I say, the job of creating a culture is yours and yours alone forever. Friction is huge psychological burden. Without friction, we would not have fire and we would not have sparks. I got to get it nice. I got to hide it. I end up spending a lot of time ruminating. I'm Bob Sutton. I'm an organizational psychologist and a Stanford engineering professor. And I've spent much of my life trying to understand how to make organizations and make the work that people do in them a bit better. A couple of years ago, I got quite interested in the challenge of organizational friction, especially bad organizational friction, to learn more about this problem. I've invited some of the smartest and sometimes some of the funniest people I know to have some conversations with us about this challenge. This is the Friction Podcast. Today our guest is Paddy McCord, who for 14 years was Chief Talent Officer of Netflix. Right after she stepped away from Netflix, she wrote a great piece for Harvard Business Review on reinventing HR, the most widely read piece of the year. The reason that we've invited Paddy to join us today is she has such a bold and I think different perspective on human resources. Her argument in particular is that the way that an organization should work is it should be for fully formed adults and that's one of the reasons that Netflix is in low friction culture. You don't have to have too many controls or too much structure. So Paddy, welcome to the podcast. It's a delight to have you. Thank you Bob. It's great to be here. There's this thing you've been talking about how organizations should be designed for and breed fully formed adults. Can you tell us what you mean by fully formed adults? Well, I don't mean anything that has anything to do with age. So I get a lot of conversations. People want to have conversations about millennials and I don't like to talk about it. I think it's stupid. You were a millennial. I was a millennial. It was a long time ago. Bob, it's called being young, being early in your career. What do you want? Everything? When do you want it now? The fully formed adult can be someone who is serious about their life and their career and what they want to contribute. And so you can have fully formed adults in their 20s all the time. And there are plenty of not fully formed adults in their 40s and 50s and we work with them every day. You know, it's more like a perspective on thinking about working together. So one of the first things I think you ever said to me, I think you were standing outside the hall of my office. And almost immediately you said, my philosophy is no assholes, no bozos. So it seems to me like those are both the opposite of fully formed adults. So how do you tell when you've got one of those on your hands that you don't want? Well, let me take you to how I got there. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm going to hear. You know, I'm a 30 year Silicon Valley vet. And I came through HR, right? I started out recruiting. So my job was to find the most amazing talent to do the most amazing things, particularly on the technical side. And then as I sort of matured in HR, then my job was to make sure that they're incredibly happy so they could do amazing work and make powerful contributions. And it was this sort of godlike worship of engineers that was kind of nauseating. And so we kind of turned them into bozos and assholes and tolerated them. So it was more about like non-toleration of the talented jerk, right? So when read and I did a company, read Hastings, Front and CEO of Netflix, and I had done another company before Netflix. And I had come from that culture of, you know, make the engineers happy, make the engineers happy. And when he asked me to come to Netflix, I didn't want to do it because I thought it was a dumb idea. But the company was a dumb idea? Yeah, come on. DVDs in the mail at that time. I mean, you know, and DVD players cost $1,500. I'm like, well, are you going to sell these too? You and the five other people that have other fees. I mean, it's just, and Blockbuster was a thousand times. I mean, there's no disputing that they were, I mean, take them down. But how he lured me was he said we could create the kind of company we always wanted. And I said, okay, like no bows, there's no assholes. I mean it. And there wasn't just the engineering side. It wasn't just the technical side. I was also tired of tolerating the people that were nice and worked hard and didn't get much done, right? So the people that just weren't the smartest people you could put in every job, but they had been there for a long time. And they remembered everybody's birthday and, you know, they were fun to be around. And that is the company scaled. You kept making smaller, smaller jobs to keep the nice people because you felt bad about not having them. And so that was sort of both sides of that. And Boses is not a nice way to spend it. No, it's not a nice way to spend it. But my point is, it's memorable. Yeah, I just didn't, you know, I wanted people who were grown-ups who wanted to work hard and create something. Let me tell you about a story about somebody we both know. This is Neil Blumenthal at Warby Parker. Uh-huh. When I first started working with Warby Parker, I mean, this is way, it seems it was only like three or four years ago, it was way back in the time machine. They had separated out their customer service team from their other team in Manhattan. The customer service people were, they were worried about them not feeling like family anymore. And I said to Neil, I met with customer service people and their recruiters and everybody involved with them and all the, you know, all the consternation about moving them back to the office in Manhattan. So I said to Neil, you know, you told me that the number one thing that mattered to you as a leader was honesty and candor and openness. It's like, you know that, Patty. And you're so sincere, right? It's absolutely true. And I said, well, then why are you lying to the people in customer service? And he said, I haven't talked to anybody in customer service in months. You're right. I probably should go over there. And I said, did you not say one time that if you join Warby Parker and customer service will take care of your career? Mm-hmm. That you have the opportunity to go anywhere you want to go. And he said, yeah, but I said that like years ago. And I said, the recruiters tell potential candidates every day. Like Neil Blumenthal says. Oh my goodness. And you know, and it's an example of like, you know, and he's like, oh, you know, like he meant it to be nice and he meant it to be true. And he completely believed, but he had never thought about that he hadn't unsaid it. Okay. And that the reality was not that anymore. Well, so implied it that there's some scaling part there that it's what got you here won't get you there that there's certain things that work great. And then they become like barnacles on the hull of a ship. I would argue that as companies get bigger, you got to have more process. You got to have more hierarchy. You got to have more specialization. And they're just going to get more bureaucratic and it's just going to feel even the best cases like you're walking in muck as it gets bigger and bigger. No. So that's how I want to hear. So how do you stop that crap from happening? How do you stop it? As scale and complexity go hand in hand. Yes. So you're not necessary and we tend to when we're talking about people talk about them as separate entities. So you you say we're so big we just have to, you know, make sure that we have more process because then we'll go faster and process always slows you down. So the difference between process and discipline is discipline is this is how we do things. This is how we behave with each other. And the more you can make some parts of your discipline self-replicating, you can replicate that across 100,000 employees if you have 10,000 people who know how to do it. If you start with the customer first or you start with the outcome first, you work your way from the outcome backwards, then you'll realize that silos are just going to slow you down. Okay. And I think really truly in the companies that I've seen that are incredibly successful, they're collaborative. And all of our tools, all of our technical tools allow us to collaborate now. And so it's most of the companies I work with are companies or internet companies where you're solving for the customer and you can't solve for the customer siloed. You can't do it. So if I say, wow, I've got this great product and it needs to work technically it needs to work. It needs to be something you care about, right, solve a problem. It needs to be profitable, right? So what it reminds me of is in the early days of Southwest when they're under her, her color, they figured out that a lot of the employees were shareholders in too, that once the 73rd person got on the plane, they were making money. Everybody in the company would work so hard to get to 75 or 76 so that they can make some money. I mean, I take every conflict management class till health freezes over and throw it away and replace it with how to understand the basic levers of your business, who your customers are, who your competitors are, what you're, you know, what you're trying to accomplish. When people can, back to the conflict, when people can internalize that, you can give them a ton of freedom. Because they're going to make judgment on calls based on what's the right. So that's back to fully form adults again. And so at Netflix, I was lucky enough, net read and I didn't write the Netflix culture deck. It was a collaboration amongst the leadership teams at Netflix over all those, it's almost 20 years now. And they still work on it, right? Because I talk to read all the time. So it's not like we didn't suddenly do it. My job at Netflix was to see oh, oh, of the culture. I was the one that said, if we write something down, what do we actually do to do it? And now when I consult with people, every time I meet with a startup CEO, they throw their slide deck in front of me and say, we want to, we took the ones things we like from Netflix that we want to do this. And then I usually throw it over my back and say, it's not anything you write down on this slide. It's what you do. When friction is addictingly wonderful, it's when you have a really hard problem to solve, a business problem either on behalf of the business, on behalf of the customer, and you're surrounded by brilliant people. And you go into the discussion sort of, you know, excited and ready to stand your ground or argue your point or be convinced otherwise, right? And you feel really prepared. Then that kind of healthy debate is a great sport, you know? And especially, you know, when I think about my vision was like at times when I have walked in absolutely sure of my position and been convinced otherwise. So that's the sort of creative abrasion, sort of view of friction. Yeah. And that healthy and respectful challenging of your thought process, not your, not just your conclusions. And that, you know, I learned to facilitate over time by, you know, taking that when I'm looking at you and I think, you don't know what the hell you're talking about, you're completely clueless. And closing my eyes and counting to ten and saying, Bob is totally clueless. He doesn't, he either doesn't know what I'm talking about, right? Or I don't know what he's talking about. So if I can stay calm in the middle of this heated debate and say, help me understand where you're coming from, what leads you to believe that's true. And now we get to challenge each other's assumptions and that's when the sport starts to happen. So that's when it's sort of a classic, constructive conflict where I'm listening to you, I'm thinking you're probably wrong, but I'm listening enough that I can, I can actually change my mind. Yeah. And it only occurs when I trust you. Okay. Right. And it only occurs with that weird thing that when it's good friction, I feel that you're arguing passionately on behalf of the right thing for the company or the customer. Not just for me because I'm smarter than you are. And I'm going to prove that you're not, right? Because I, because you walked in being smarter and now my job is to prove you're not. How would you make sure to keep it functional and keep the dysfunction from improving it? You have to be able to call out in a meeting, for example, where we're discussing a decision that you and I have been discussing, discussing outside of the meeting. And I know you don't agree with what you think the leader is going to conclude. In fact, you've been nagging me about that for months, right? And we're in the meeting and it's an hour and a half into the meeting and we're about to conclude. And the leader of the meeting says, okay, so we've all decided to do X. And I know Bob doesn't think that's a good idea. And it's about me saying, so before we do this, hey, Bob, you know, you've been bending my ear that this is stupid as I do. You've ever heard for three months. So did we change your mind in this meeting? Because like when we get out of here, don't be talking about this to me anymore because it's done is done. This is here to decide. And then you can't say, actually, you did change my mind or no, I just, you know, nobody was going to ask me anyway. And then I would say in front of everybody, well, I told you that's the kiss of death. Okay. And then you argue your side and now you're heard and everybody else in the meeting, again, this is the practice. It's not just the practice of doing it. It's the practice of observing. So everybody else in the room says, wow, Patty and Bob just gotten an argument and nobody died. Okay. It wasn't career limiting. And then I implied in that is there's not the backstabbing and second guessing that occurs once you make the decision and leave the room. Here's the deal about backstabbing. I love backstabbing as a metaphor. Because backstabbing is a great metaphor for office politics. Yes, it is. Academic, whatever kind of politics. So here's the deal about politics. It's really inefficient. I got to get a knife. I got to hide it. I got to wait till you turn around. I got to stab you in the back. I got to make sure that it goes in deep enough to kill you because I actually don't want you to come back like a weird, right? Then there's the blood. Then there's the body. I mean, really, seriously, it's a lot easier for me to go see this knife. So I'm doing this. So you've already described what dysfunctional friction looks like. So when you start hanging out with them and talking to them, what's the symptoms? When you see friction, like you mentioned politics. It's very different. Sometimes it's almost the opposite. It's the unseen friction coded in niceness. Ooh, yeah. You know that one where I say instead of saying, Bob, stop doing that. You're making me fucking crazy, right? I say, you know, Bob, I'm kind of uncomfortable with where this is going. But I know your heart's in the right place. And so I just, you know, I agree with you completely. It's just the implementation that I think might be difficult. And our teams might have some friction. So you have just described to me the Stanford culture. So tell me some ways about why best practices, if you want to get rid of friction, why it actually does the opposite. Because to me, that's what you've been implying a lot of the stuff. So I mean, all my stuff, you've read this a million times. If you said, I believe that giving people feedback might result in better performance. I instinctively think that's true. If I gave you something, it happens with your pets, it happens with your kids, it happens with a sport. You know, you give people feedback and I get better, right? I'm going to create a system to give people feedback so they'll be better performers. And you didn't invent the annual performance review. No, it's just the dumbest product idea you ever heard. You'd be like, throw that out. That's not going to work for one thing. Nobody's going to get good at it because they only do it once. And second of all, you're going to, and you're going to reward them for what they did, not what they're going to do. Yeah, well, that would be a perfect example. And you're going to pay them for performance you don't. You actually pay them for effort. You pay if you end up paying people to work hard. And oh, by the way, those paper for performance models with rigid internal systems actually economically keep you down. Right? So if you, employees cannot be successful staying in a corporation with a 6.5% merit increase budget, if they can change jobs and make 12%. It's just like bad economics. If you could get organizations to stop doing one thing and think of friction especially for me, what, what, what would you tell me, Irrita? I would tell them to tell the truth. Ooh, lies. No, it's not lies. It's the nuance of the nice communication. Ooh. It's like, humans can hear anything. It's true. You don't like it, but you can't dispute it. I mean, these are the things I learned from engineers, right? The world is black or white. It's good or bad. It's right or wrong. It's zero or one, right? And so if I say, you know about that interdepartmental communication issue, Bob, that you continue to have because I sense the friction from my colleagues in the other department where the people in their organizations are less than enthusiastic about potential engagement with you. And the translation is Bob, you're an asshole in those meetings and nobody wants to come anymore. And because you keep acting like you're the authority and everybody wonders why they have to come in and listen to you pontificate, just send an email, okay? That's pretty good. So I think that's a good way to, that's a great way. So Patty, thank you so much for joining us. That was really fun. What I hope that you'll take away from today's podcast in particular is the power of having an organizational culture with a strong point of view where strong ideas are expressed and they're actually implemented. And while those strong ideas might not be right for everyone, the reason that they work in a place like Netflix is everybody knows what's good behavior, what's bad behavior, and it actually gets rid of a lot of friction because people aren't confused about what to do and they don't argue about how to do things.

Thanks once again to our wonderful guest, Patty McCord. I'm Bob Sutton. Thanks again for listening to our podcast. Here is today's final tangent. Here's the jargon I use. I'm from Texas. And my mom would say, misery loves company honey. And when you got a miserable employer, then it's just going to look for all kinds of people to feel bad about it with you. I divide employees into three categories. There are a third of the people think their as mom, I would say they're a pig and shit. They're just having a great time. They love what they're doing. The company's terrific. Their management is wonderful. Let's go. And then a third of them are like, I'm not sure if this is really what I want to do. I don't really like how we re-yorked. I'm kind of done with this. I'm bored, I'm burnt out. And then the middle follows whoever gets the most noise.
