 This is the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series brought to you by Stanford Equal. Welcome to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader seminar at Stanford ETL is brought to you by basis the Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students and STVP, the Entrepreneurship Center in the School of Engineering at Stanford. I am Ravi Belani, a lecturer in the Management Science and Engineering Department at Stanford, and the Director of Alchemist and Accelerator for Enterprise startups. Today we are thrilled to have Professor Kathleen Eisenhart as our keynote. How many people have heard of Professor Eisenhart before today? Has anybody taken one of Professor Eisenhart's classes? Okay, if not, you are in for a treat. Professor Eisenhart's academic foundations were in engineering. She got a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Brown, and then a master's degree in Computer Science, and then crossed over to the dark side when she got a PhD from the Business School here at Stanford from the Graduate School of Business with a focus on strategy and organization. And that crossed over foreshadowed the sandbox in which Professor Eisenhart plays, where she's one of the leading researchers in the world right now on issues at the nexus of strategy and high velocity, tech driven entrepreneurship and startups. Professor Eisenhart's official title is the Asherman Professor of Strategy and Organization in Stanford School of Engineering. She's a member of STVP, which is the Stanford Engineering Entrepreneurship Center, and the Digital Economy Lab. And she's among the most widely cited entrepreneur scholars in the world, having authored over 100 articles in research and business journals and several books. Her most recent book with Dawn Saul is Simple Rules, How to Survive in a Complex World, and it was designated a top business book by the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg Business Week, and The Washington Post. An accomplished teacher of several popular undergrad and grad courses, Professor Eisenhart's enjoys bringing research insights into the classroom, and is currently studying exceptional growth ventures, as well as strategy making in new marketplaces, community versus firm innovation, and business model design. Professor Eisenhart's on tons of lists, but including the thinker's 50 list of the most influential global thought leaders in business, and her research has won many honors, including the Global Entrepreneurship Research Award. Her practice-focused articles were the first to be featured on the Harvard Business Review on Point Collection, and if that's not enough, Professor Eisenhart also has six honorary doctorate degrees. So without further ado, please welcome Professor Eisenhart. Thank you, Robbie, for the great introduction and good afternoon, everybody, and thank you so much for spending your afternoon here, or at least part of your afternoon. Now, you're probably wondering what a professor can add that, for example, Andrew Ng didn't know, or some other entrepreneur didn't know, or what some VC didn't know. What is a professor know? Well, what we know that they don't know is we actually study lots of different companies. We study good ones, we study bad ones, and so compared to an entrepreneur who may be have experience in two, three, four, maybe five companies, I've seen a hundred. VCs tend to focus in industry, I don't focus. So what we have, what our advantage is is we know lots of different companies, we know good ones, we know bad ones, and we also have the time to step back and think about what we're seeing. Because real entrepreneurs are super busy, they don't have much time to reflect. VCs, similarly very busy, they don't have time to reflect, and what our business is is thinking about what we're seeing and thinking about it at a higher level. So that's why you're listening to a professor and why, what are, if you will, competitive advantages. My academic arc, I've been at Stanford longer than I like to think, but I started out studying top management teams. So one of my first breakout articles was on how do top management teams make fast decisions. I did a bunch of stuff on top management teams, some consulting. Then I went to look at big businesses, then I took a little time, it was time to be a guru, and you get to make money and be famous, so that was sort of fun. And now I'm back doing professor stuff. Research, teaching, I'm actually on sabbatical this year, which is probably why none of you see me, but I'm on sabbatical, I'm back research in teaching, and doing the things that I became a professor to do. So what I'm going to do today is talk a bit about what I've learned over the years on strategy in new companies, and so that's where we'll start. But you can ask me about a lot of things. I know acquisitions, boards, all sorts of stuff that I'm not going to talk about today. So let's get started on the slides. There they are. Okay. So that's the intro, and there's an orca. What I want to start out with is the idea of an opportunity is not a strategy. Airbnb started in about 2007, which as you probably know is a couple of guys in the city who were fairly poor at the time and rented out a space on their floor for air mattress, gave people a bagel and called it good. And that was the start of Airbnb. And they realized that actually there was a lot of uptake in what the Airbnb opportunity was. But it took them probably 18 months to figure out what's the product, what's the business model, who the customer is, and so on. So they started thinking out it was really a convention business, and it was for younger people. It turns out there are more people using Airbnb like me than are like you. So they were completely had it wrong. So the point is that seeing an opportunity is not the same thing as having a strategy. Second point I want to just talk about what is a strategy? Strategy is a set of irredeparated activities to create and capture value. So that's sort of the formal definition of strategy. But it's really how firms try to win against one another. In a particular place I'm going to be talking about today is strategy in nascent markets. nascent markets are new markets, disrupted markets, and they're characterized by uncertainty, ambiguity and speed. So we may not know who the customer is, we know what the product is, we have no idea who our arrivals are going to be. We don't know what the value proposition is. So they're characterized by either disruption or just being plain old new. So that's the space we're talking about today. Strategy in these kinds of markets. And the dilemma in these markets is on the one hand, you have to form a novel strategy by doing things. You can't just plan because the market is too uncertain. So you can't plan to do stuff. On the other hand you also have to come up with a coherent strategy that fits together. So that the product and the go to market and so on all fit together. So you have to both do thinking and you have to do doing. And the talk today is going to divide between thinking and doing. So thinking. First of all, what is thinking about? There are really three things that I think that I've seen over various studies and consulting gigs and so on that differentiate how people think well and poorly. The first of all is best entrepreneurs tend to see the entire playing field. So they're like point guards in basketball, they're like midfielders in soccer, they're seeing the whole field. The second thing is they typically don't take the playing field is given. It's something in fact they can shape. They can make it bigger, smaller, they may get a rectangle or a triangle. And then finally they understand what game they're playing. In other words they understand the underlying economics of the business. So let me give you a couple examples of that. This was a study that we did where I met Donald and I did in FinTech. And this was a set of companies we looked at that were trying to do something that was called social investing. And it wasn't really about social mission. It was more about the idea that there are amateur investors who were great and that other amateur investors could follow them and also be financially successful too. So that's how it started out. And what the better firms were able to do is they realized the whole spectrum of who they were actually playing with, who the customers were, who the suppliers were. But most importantly who the substitutes were. And in particular the substitutes were the big banks like the Morgan Stanley's and the USB's and so on. So it was the big banks. And so the better firms understood that in fact their rivalry was with those substitutes and it wasn't with other startups. Other startups didn't matter because they were small and trivial. Instead what they were trying to do was disrupt substitute incumbents. So they really saw the big picture and they particularly saw the incumbents. The second idea is the idea that they also shaped the playing field. This was a study that I did a while back. It was on what we called the Internet Stars. And if I told you who these companies were you would know every one of them. But we were studying them back when they were still kind of nobody's. And this was five firms that had gone on to be great. And what we saw that they differentiated from themselves from the other firms that were that were starting at the same time was that they were changing the playing field. And in particular what they were doing was allying with large companies who they thought might enter and be rivals. And instead co-opted them often gave them an equity stake to keep them out to keep them as complementers not as rivals. They also were acquiring other small startups. But not to get their assets. But to take them off the board as a rival. They were also engaging in a number of symbolic actions. For example storytelling, founding storytelling of how the founder was this really frugal guy who drove across the country and the BW bus. And there's other stories around my girlfriend wanted something. And so I created this marketplace. So they had these stories that were fairly colorful. It's kind of true but kind of not. But very catchy for the media. So what these entrepreneurs were doing was they were changing, they were shaping what the structure was. Keeping certain rivals out, getting rid of other rivals. And creating what they called a cognitive reference. They became the company that you thought of when you thought of that market. Another example of that was a study we did in mobile gaming. There was a time when people didn't actually know what mobile gaming was. And so it was an ecosystem of developers, games, handset makers, platforms, and brands. So a lot of different players all kind of milling around trying to figure out who owned the customer and what the business model was. What the better entrepreneurs did was they had a vision of what the industry should look like and gave themselves a role that was important. Whereas the people who did not do well, the entrepreneurs who didn't do well did not think about the entire vision. But in fact, thought about building a great game. So it was all for the weaker players. It was all about building the technology. For the better players it was about seeing you actually had to put the pieces together and you had to give yourself a role. And you could be an instrumental player in terms of of building relationships and building that architecture. For example, one of the things they would do is they would, they were little companies. They would see a brand they wanted, like Lord of the Rings and a particular carrier, like AT&T. And what they would say to AT&T is they would say things like, I'm working with Lord of the Rings. And they would go to Lord of the Rings and say, I'm working with AT&T. And so they would, and they were sort of working with them, but they sort of worked. But they were actually taking advantage of that information arbitrage. So that was, so essentially they were, they were making themselves at the center by contrast the other, the other folks were focusing on a great product, but sort of missing the bigger picture. And interesting, just a little side tip on that was that that the entrepreneurs and Los Angeles got that, got the winning message much better than Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs were very tech focused. The people in L.A. understood perhaps in the movie industry that you have to put together the pieces and give yourself a good spot. Another idea is playing the correct game. One of the things that always surprises me is how little entrepreneurs understand the underlying economics of their business. You would think they would know, but in fact they don't, often they don't, I mean some do, but many don't. So this is an example from the residential solar industry. And it's an ecosystem example. Actually mobile gaming is an ecosystem example as well, but this is one where the parts of the system are you have to have panels, you have to have racking, you have to have installation system design, sales, and finance. So there's a bunch of pieces you have to put together. And what we observed is that, is that there are really three strategies you can use. You can use a system strategy, which was solar city, where you do everything. So it's a vertically integrated strategy of you do the financing, you do the panels, you do the sales and design, you do the installation. So you can do a system strategy, you can do a component strategy where you, for example, you do one piece and then partner with all the rest. For example, you do some, you do sales and design and then partner with other manufacturers, partner with finance. Or you can do the most exotic strategy was the bottleneck strategy where you figure out where the bottleneck is and then fill that bottleneck and then move your strategy. So one company that was doing that would start it in finance because finance was actually a big bottleneck for people. How do I finance it? They bundled together solar contracts and then sold them on Wall Street. But then when finance wasn't a bottleneck anymore, they actually moved to sales and design. So the point is they're actually in that particular, in ecosystems, there are actually three strategies you can, you can, you can follow. And I think it's the game is at hearts or crazy Hs. There's one of those games where you can shoot the moon. I forget what card game that is. You remember Robbie? It's crazy itself. So you can, you can shoot the moon, which is kind of the system strategy or you can play a conservative, which is the component strategy or you can just be innovated, which was the bottleneck strategy. So if those are the good strategies, what are the bad strategies? The strategy, the bad strategies are just focusing on a component and forgetting that you have to put all the complementers together. So we have great finance, but we forgot to put the rest of it together. We have great sales and design, but we forgot to get the rest. Or it's straddling. Kind of like playing tennis, you either get play at the front or you play at, you play at the net or you play at the back. Well, if you straddle and you're partly a component and partly a system, you don't get the advantages of either one. So there are actually there were bad strategies too. Another example, everybody good? Okay, this is out, this is the app store. So this is strategies are like digital goods, like candy crush, Robin Hood, open table, New York times. I'm not sure you are, I'm sure you have apps that you probably use that I probably don't use. But the big thing in strategy in terms of app stores, digital goods is really a business model and more specifically the revenue model. So is it a paid model? Is it a free model or is it a freemium model? Are the key choices? And it turns out that if you do the free model, it's not really free. What is it? It's a third party payer. Sometimes that's an advertiser and somebody's times that somebody else. Perfect example of a great app that does third party pay is WebMD. And the key to having a free app and third party pay is you're gathering something about the users that you can sell. So WebMD gives you insight in terms of what a particular person using the app, what health concern that person has. Is it heart disease? Is it the measles? Is it whatever? And then that allows the sale of target advertising. By contrast, the pay model requires you to be able to see quality signal. You've got a signal that this is a great app and you don't have to check it out. You know it's going to be good. You'll pay for it. New York Times is the classic example of a paid app. Finally, the interesting app is of course the freemium app. And that's the hardest app to do because you have is a more complex programming problem. And you also have to figure out what's free and what's what you pay for. So in Candy Crush it was fairly simple. You pay for you know you get the Candy Crush basic game but then you can power up with various ways for the for the paid. But freemium tends to be more complex because you've got to figure out where to draw that line between free and pay. So that's the good sort of the better apps on the and the app store tend to have figured out which revenue model fits what they actually are doing. By contrast what do not so good apps do? They pick the wrong one. For example people will have an app and they'll say well somebody will sell it with an advertising model. But they don't have enough information about the user to actually sell anything useful. So it's such a generic app that there's nothing special about the user that you can sell. Or they say things like they'll have it a pay app and say well you know people should pay five bucks for my app because that's like a Starbucks coffee. I put a lot of work into this and so you should pay you know like who cares about that you know that doesn't work either. And then finally what you often see is entrepreneurs who are less savvy just avoid the freemium model because it's too hard. So weaker entrepreneurs tend to go to paid or free but they don't understand it. More savvy entrepreneurs select smartly about among them and in particular willing to go into the effort of freemium. I'm going to talk about marketplaces in a little bit but I'm going to skip it for now. And I'm going to say a little something about online MOOCs. This is another study we did. And what it means to be a complex established industry. What does that mean? That means an industry like healthcare, higher education, defense where there are a number of big established players. Some of whom have a commercial business logic but many of them of whom don't and may even not like profit. So for example in healthcare there is a logic around care of the patient. There's a logic around scientific advancement but profit maybe not so much. In higher education where we were studying there was there was a logic around in particular democratization of education having it free and so on so much of a social welfare logic. Proper not so much. So when these kinds of industries there are a couple different strategies but one of the interesting ones is what we call a diplomacy strategy. If you've got a lot of big institutional players who aren't so commercially oriented what you have to do is build coalitions with them and build relationships. So before you can even get going with the business model you have to build relationships. And so the more successful companies in this arena basically built relationships with higher education, built coalitions, had ambassadors and so on and then only later brought in the commercial side. Once the university's felt comfortable with the profit motive and then they started realizing their self interest around profit as we had Stanford know they figured out the better model. And final thing I'll talk about in terms of economics is unit economics which is something we tend to forget about. Particularly when we're talking about physical good but really any good that's got at least some variable cost even software has some variable cost around customer acquisition or around for example customer support. The importance of unit economics because if you can't make money on a basic transaction like when I sell the pen I can't make money. All you do when you grow is you lose more and more money. And so this is again this is the unit level so you may choose to be unprofitable at the firm level but it's really important to be profitable at the unit level and take that as a first priority that you do particularly if there any kind of variable costs. And there are a couple reasons why that's true. One of the things is if you focus on variable if you focus on unit economics that means the revenue minus the costs is the profit you of course are going to have more profitable unit economics that's sort of obvious but what you also do is you tend to also build a simpler business model and a simpler business model is easier to replicate and easier to scale. The other thing that you get when you focus on unit economics it forces you to look at more aspects of the business. For example we were looking in online fashion and one of the companies we looked at was carrying inventory and sending clothing out to people it's consumers. They started looking at shipping and then realized that they actually changed their business model to if you buy five product if you buy five outfits you get a cheaper price saved on the shipping costs. They realized that they charged people 20 bucks to use the site they got better customers so even though they lost some customers they got customers who are more likely to buy. So as you explore the costs and the revenue and the interrelationship of cost and revenues you start to develop a better strategic understanding. So unit economics not only forces you to be more not forces you but encourages you or leads you to better unit economics it leads you to simpler unit economics which scale better and leads you to a better strategic understanding of your business. By contrast the entrepreneurs who simply focus on growth they find product market fit and start growing they never really understand the business well enough and in the meantime they start developing a culture of we're growing it's great to grow and they keep and but what they can never what's very hard to go back to doing as you're as you're scaling is to go back and fix the unit economics and after a while your funders get tired what they don't see that you're ever going to be profitable. If you're in a big market like Uber they'll wait a long time but for most startups they want to see some profitability so they'll encourage he sees will encourage you for growth early on but then they'll turn the tables on you around C. C. and say so when are you going to be profitable so unit economics. So overall what is the story here the story is when you're thinking see the entire playing field particularly focusing on the substitutes not your rivals little rivals don't matter substitutes matter understand that you can change the shape of the playing field and then understand the basic economics of what you're doing. Okay that's the that's the thinking side let me just say a few things about the doing side doing side focus on what's new what's new what's new part what's new is the idea you focus on the substitutes what's new is that you see interest your architecture can change what's new is really the importance of economics which I don't think many entrepreneurship courses I'm sure some do it here at Stanford but broadly in the in the world or in the states people aren't facing looking at at at the underlying economics. Okay I'm on doing now everybody good okay okay so doing this is doing actually means learning but what we've seen in learning is first of all you have a repertoire of processes you understand strategic timing and you use the right problem solving strategy. I'll unpack that and tell you what that means in like real life so this is that we did a study of two sided marketplaces again we used we always look at good companies and bad companies bad is probably too harsh but you know less successful like I think I've seen in every study we've done every consulting I've done experimentation is a good thing to do experimentation just works and I can talk more in the Q&A if you want me to tell you what good experiments look like but a very sick experimentation works but what people don't always understand is actually very synergistic with trial and error so engaging in trial and error and then experimenting advice first it actually works really well and so for example in this in this marketplace one of the companies in the marketplace was a company that we called by a pseudonym market market chef and there what they were doing was they it was a business that connected travelers in Asia or around the world but initially Asia with local hosts where you could go and have a home made home made meal so you could go to Bangkok and go to somebody's house and have a home made meal and you know a more local experience so they were essentially a marketplace what they did was start out with some ideas of what that marketplace was going to be for example they thought they that they're the ideal host was going to be a rural poor woman in fact that was not they realized that actually they needed somebody who had internet which meeting you were actually were more middle class not poor and that people actually wanted to go to cities and not so much rural areas so it was actually a different demographic they started to figure that out as they disentral an error and then disin experiments to actually home what the ideal host was similarly they didn't really have an idea of exactly where cities they wanted but they tried a few out for example they went to Pouquet I don't know if you all know Pouquet and Thailand if you don't know Pouquet is a party place particularly for Australians so Australians partying you can kind of get what that might be it was not the same as the person who wants a quiet meal in a local experience so they realized no more partier so they did some more experimentation no more party locations what we really want to go to is a place like a bud which you may not this in Bali as well but that's a very local cultural place with not a party crowd so the idea is they combined experimentation with trial and error another example is is back to the fintech ventures that I mentioned before that was an interesting study because it showed that yes you do experimentation and yes you do trial and error but there are other kinds of learning like you can learn from your rivals you can actually copy your rivals if you want to so you can set some invitation you can also engage in passive learning which just really means you don't do anything you just kind of watch what's going on so the idea in that study and other studies we've done is that having a repertoire of learning processes not just experimentation not just trial and error but having a repertoire that you're using is actually the most effective thing to do then finally I did we did a study that was looking at pairs of pairs of pairs of actually triples of new companies from Finland Sweden or excuse me Finland Singapore and the US so culturally pretty different countries and then we matched them on what industry they were going in so it's kind of a match sample and we were looking at how they internationalized and there the idea was what we realized is that what people the entrepreneurs who internationalized most effectively learned simple rules about how to how to internationalize for example they would learn like one of them was learned that actually they did better in former British Empire countries so basically British speaking English speaking countries and then there were whole that proxies for a whole bunch of different things or they learned other rules around the kind of customer that would work for them or they learned when to be greenfield or when to be something but they essentially learned simple rules about that process by contrast the entrepreneurs who learned random stuff like the French enjoy wine or you know if you go out with Japanese you know you may have to go out late at night and go to long dinners so they learned sort of random stuff but the ones who actually learned rules about what worked and what didn't could then scale those rules and then they're the paper and if you're interested in the book that Robbie mentioned on simple rules talks about all the different kinds of simple rules but essentially it's not just that you're using a variety of processes like experimentation or trial and error but the content of what you're learning if it's a repeated process like hiring like entering a new country like hiring hosts whatever it is their simple rules will actually make you make you more effective. I'm getting a little near the end so I'll just say a couple last things about timing I preface this before but let me go back to it the idea that sometimes you just want to do nothing I think we get an idea and entrepreneurship that's go go go you got to keep got to keep rolling in contrast with this study was showed this was this turned out to be it turned out to be these the better models were marketplaces but they put the marketplace out there and they didn't actually know who was going to use the market and it was a market that was connecting investors and people who wanted to follow investors so I will say I'm I'm I'm I'm Robbie's an investor and I want to follow him and I realize oh I like I like Robbie's performance I'm going to follow Robbie so they just put the they had the they had the website out there in the marketplace and then they just watched it for a while and tried to figure out who was going to use it because they didn't really know who was going to use it and it turned out that actually who used it was was not amateur investors but in fact investors who were professional investors from small towns like Bendoorgan who didn't really have the distribution and this was really great for them and then they went on and did some more things and they ended up with robo investing but the idea was they simply didn't do anything for a while they just watched to see what would happen another idea is this idea I was talking about unit economics before um this this study that we did in the online fashion we looked at retail we looked at three business models retail rental and um use clothing marketplaces and what we saw was that it was actually a good idea to stop your growth the whole back your growth the pause your growth so you could learn because it was too hard to learn why you were growing so as you're perfecting your unit economics in your product market fit you needed to actually get your website close your customers not advertise and so on see you could actually learn enough so the point is again you don't want necessarily always want to go as fast as you can but you want to go you want to you you want to understand that the timing can vary so much like in sports you don't always if you're playing basketball you don't always play up tempo sometimes you cut the tempo back it depends on who your opponent is you've been going on so like in sports you you manage the timing and then finally problem solving archery is a little bit abstract but let me this is I want to tell you this because I think marketplaces are interesting marketplaces are companies like Airbnb at sea uber so there's buyers there's sellers and then there's a transaction platform and sometimes there's a geographic component to it like like there is a Airbnb for example and what's interesting about a marketplace strategy it's what's known as a complex novel problem and some of you may know that from computer science or complex novel problems are novel means new complex means the pieces are interconnected so buyers sellers platform geography all have to fit together and the way you actually build that is not doing everything all at once like when you have a mature marketplace it's about balancing buyers and sellers and taking advantage of network effects but when you have a new marketplace it's not it's about first of all typically figuring out and building a platform around the sellers then the buyers then the geography and depending on the complexity of the platform you fit it in somewhere if it's a very complex platform like uber you make do it first if it's a more simple platform let's say like a posh mark you might put it down after after buyers and sellers but the idea is you don't put the marketplace together all at once you you put you learn one thing then add the next thing then add the next thing and so what you learn you learn the suppliers and then you pause you don't grow it then you learn the buyers you figure out who they are pause it then you figure out maybe that then you do the transaction platform and you hone that and then you figure out what the geographic expansion algorithm is and then you build it but if you build it all together there's too much going on and you can't you can't manage it so it's the step by step that I think people often people often say oh it's platforms and marketplaces it must be network effects it's not network effects until you build those pieces and you build those pieces one at a time so that's about a mean by product architecture and then finally just a little bit on drones and I think I'm about at the end to you I'm at the end let me just say I think it maybe just won't say anything about this you can ask me if you care about drones but let's see here so what am I saying I'm saying doing is about a repertoire of learning processes not just the experimentation think about timing and think about how you're actually solving the problem what's the sequence of the problem solving steps and that's probably the most abstract part so what's new the idea is not just experimentation the idea of the timing matters it's not things like first-mover advantage scale economies network effects often come later before you after you've gotten things right and finally the what to learn not just not just learning so that was that was I think my story um strategy in new markets and because I like that picture so anyway any comments questions thoughts or did I tell you too much I don't know are you all good so you mentioned uh that simple business plans are easy to replicate an easy to scale I believe and business models yeah business models or strategies have you ever come across a simple business plan that's hard to replicate an easy to scale or a complex plan that is the unit economics it's profits if it's the revenue minus the cost that being simple I mostly seen if it's if it's complicated it's got a lot of pieces to it for example we looked at we looked at a marketplace where the the simple marketplace connected buyers and sellers on the platform and had a and the sellers would send the stuff to the buyers and they had made a deal with the post offices there was a flat rate so you only had a flat rate the platform took a simple cut from the from the seller uh and and the seller was in charge of sending it so that was a very simple unit economics another company that started at the same time doing the same thing it was you know people cleaning out their closet and hoping other people would buy it um had this company carried the inventory themselves so the sellers sent the inventory to the firm they were taking a transaction cut from the buyer and the seller um and they had variable shipping costs and so it was a much more complicated transaction which even if you could get that to work it was hard to scale and so simpler simpler core transactions tend to be easier to replicate and easier to scale hi professor A. Z. Harden thank you for your presentation um could you please explain again the solving a complex and novel problem i was thinking when you were saying that about when Microsoft didn't innovate on the cloud services and then Gmail completely did that so sometimes by not doing all you cannot commit in a big blunder so i was wondering what are your thoughts and if you could revisit the concept of solving a complex and novel problem yeah okay a complex novel problem is it's a it's a it's a it's a problem where there are a lot of pieces and they're interconnected and it contrasts with modular problems uh and so if i if i talked about the gj i3dr example what i would have said is 3dr was a community so it was a dispersed community of people who loved drones and the original business model was kits so you so different members of the community were designing different parts of the drone like the rotor or the the some of the receiver or something so they were so they essentially modularized it because it was a kit and the community was really good at that and that is what's known as a simple problem when the industry got more advanced and the quad rotor was developed and then you're getting the what are known as rts out of the box drones like the the gj i quad rotor the some of you may know came out of the box and it was ready to go that was a complex novel product because you had to fit together all those different parts all the and it took aeronautics mechanical and so on and so you couldn't the community couldn't design that very well because you couldn't modularize it it worked much better in a community in a firm where you could actually coordinate people so complex novel problems require integration and coordination simple problem that's why you see software can be open source because it's modular whereas hardware is typically hard to open source because it's not and that's true of strategy so marketplace strategies is another example marketplace strategies are highly integrative and so you can't just out so you can't have you know this guy doing buyers and this guy doing sellers and this guy doing the platform all at the same time because it's too integrative it doesn't work that way you have to do one at a time thank you so much I'm wondering if you guys have done any research on the successful founders mindsets and their character attributes well I think that idea the big picture the ability to see the whole industry and not just focus on the really techy cool thing so seeing the whole industry I think is a really big one the other one that I didn't talk about is but is is the ability of thinking time the ability to understand the business today understand it in six months and understand where it's going so you can go across the timeframes and if you can't do that you have a partner who can do whatever the thing is that you can't do so that ability to think in time that ability to take the big picture I think are two of two of the things that I think make for for great entrepreneurs that you may not be obvious to all of you are there any personality traits with the great entrepreneurs you know I'm not no I've never I've never seen a particular personality traits I mean I've seen shy ones and pushy ones and you know sole founders in teams and all kinds of founders so I don't know if there's a personality trait that's a good takeaway that there is none actually that not not not not defining one no I think it's more these some of these mental abilities that the better founders have that others don't and that's certainly I also actually understand the economics which is again kind of a big picture idea hello professor first of all thank you so much this was right in cypher I was curious about companies that are free for consumers free for people but then they make revenues through other companies so say things like code editors it's free for public to use but if you're a company using the code editor you have to pay for it yeah so what are some of the challenges that you should keep in mind if you want to go into that space one thing that what I understand is that you have to really build strong relations you have to really what you have to build strong relations but how do you make sure that other companies adopt your product how do you make your so you this is a company that's were you you're giving it away but somebody's paying yeah basically for public it's free yeah but if you're a business you have to be free for that okay well then you have to have I mean I think I mean everybody loves free right so we so the free parts easy it's the it's the pay part that's hard and so you have to have some sort of value proposition for the companies that makes them willing to pay and sometimes companies will do it will pay for some sort of social good but mostly they don't so you have to be so for example when I was saying about the the app store and you know we have a we have a we have a free product and we think somebody's going to want the advertising well if there's nothing about the user that you're learning that's let's you target the advertising is not a value in that so there's got to be some some sort of value unless it really is just a social mission and not to say just the social but should put a social mission next question you mentioned geographic transaction algorithms for marketplace strategies yeah could you talk more about that yeah yeah in fact that's one of the really one of the interesting things about about uber and lift uber uber had a fairly clear transaction geographic essentially simple rules and it was around go to cities where there's a lot of nightlife in sports go to cities with bad weather and there were a couple other things about what cities to go to so for example Chicago was a great place you know bad weather great sports great nightlife then there were other parts to the the simple rules that were around always send an ambassador have that ambassador have a lot of freedom have that ambassador was ever starting in city manager sometimes it was called targeting events and being sure you really swamped that event let's say uber cars so for example if you knew there was going to be a Beyonce concert you made sure that there were lots of ubers right around the outside the Beyonce concert so people wouldn't have to wait long and they'd start getting their mind are ubers wherever I'd go another thing was making deals with with hotel of concierge's so uber had a number of fairly some simple rules about how to go to how to which markets to go into and then how to scale it lift tended to be much more centralized and didn't have the rules didn't have the simplicity that uber did and didn't give their their manager as the flexibility sometimes that flexibility was a bad thing but it allowed it allowed uber to grow faster so that makes sense yeah next question can you comment on any trends you've noticed in the indoor and vertical farming space and in what space vertical and indoor farming and vertical and indoor farming um I mean I know it's happening but I don't know much about I know you're going to ask me about AI because I could actually say something about AI you can add AI to the then diagrams I'm gonna I'm gonna segue from a vertical agriculture tube to AI because that's actually been particularly online fashion study that was a really it's simply seen to be true that human plus AI beats human and in particular the better the companies that were able to grow faster which I didn't tell you they've got the unity economics and then there was the growth part of it that I didn't tell you about um were were using algorithms more effectively and had figured out how to pair people with the algorithm so they were using the using algorithms and then they were using AI and they were then figuring out how do people and AI work synergistically together which turned out to be a big sort of defensible mode for them so so AI I think is really changing strategy in some interesting ways maybe there's a thread on you know one of the the themes that you brought up was was on vertical integration you know there's like three different oh in the ecosystem yeah was that part of the angle with which you were asking the question on vertical integration or can you give more context about why or is it just a generic question on that's I think it's a new market isn't it using yeah in your hydroponic yeah yeah I think I think I've heard about it but I don't I don't know what's going on but okay what I said is will be true and at what point which should you start thinking about strategy if you're a founder should you think about it from day zero or or do you follow your passion first and then figure out the unit economics after you've done at least 10 engagements what do you do you you you you you you don't really have a your strategy early on is is learning so it's really all the the initial strategy is always about about learning and in particular learning product market fit and learning unit economics most people get product market fit although sometimes they don't but a lot of people forget unit economics and forget like like one of my co-authors brother is the founder of Clavio you know it was the big IPO this year and they actually worried about unit economics even though it's a software company they had big not big but had some variable costs around customer acquisition and customer support and so they actually thought through how are we going to do those on the unit economics very early on right we have time for one more question thank you so earlier you mentioned how one way of driving out computation is through acquisition so let's say company X or a rising competitor and the like okay the product is pretty good and they're trying to acquire them but then the company Y which is here the smaller company refuses to sell essentially the product now because they know that they can scale up later on and basically be a big I don't know a big company so then what do you do at that point the acquisition is I mean I'm it's a little sketchy on the ethics of it I think but it's essentially if you're a small company buying a small company you never get in trouble with any trust and so and it's another kind of thing about acquisitions is is when entrepreneurs are selling their company yes they care about the money but they're also selling their baby or their dog and do you give your dog to the highest let's say you have to move you have to give up your dog do you give it to the highest bidder no you're looking for the good home right if you're so your dog of course you don't sell your baby but your dog and and so entrepreneurs surprisingly foolishly think other entrepreneurs are going to be nicer than a big company and that's just not true but they think that and so they think an entrepreneur is going to be a better home for their baby and sometimes it is and sometimes it's not thank you okay I had one founder describe an acquisition as giving up your baby for adoption and then having to babysit but thank you professor eyes mark that's fantastic thank you thank you thank you next week we have the CEO and co founder of Bonobos Andy Dunn who's going to be here via a watch party and you can find that event
