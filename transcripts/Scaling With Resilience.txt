 Who you are defines how you build. This is the Auditorial Thought Leader series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. Today we are delighted to welcome Michelle Zatlin to ETL. Michelle is the co-founder, president and COO of CloudFlare, an Internet Security Performance and Reliability Company that is on a mission to help build a better Internet. Michelle is also another testament to how America is the beneficiary of outstanding Canadian talent. Michelle was born and raised in Canada, went to McGill, where she got her bachelor's degree in chemistry for all you chemistry majors out there, as well as business, and went on to do everything from being an economic research analyst to marketing, to being a product manager, before she came all down to the good old United States for Business School at Harvard. She got her MBA at Harvard, and at Harvard she also met Matt Prince, who is going to be her future co-founder on this wild journey of starting CloudFlare. She also worked at Google, did a stint at Google, and then at the end of Business School in 2009, she founded and started CloudFlare with Matt. 12 years later now, CloudFlare is a $21 billion company with over 1,800 employees and Michelle is still at the helm as the COO, which is very rare to have a founder for that full arc. So please join me in welcoming Michelle. Michelle, lots of virtual love and applause from you from the broader YouTube and Stanford communities. Thank you for the warm welcome, Robbie, and I will say I do a lot of speaking, and that may have been the best, one of the best introductions I've ever been given. So maybe you should just come with me all around, and you can just do that again, because that was good. I'm happy to. I'm happy to. Well, thank you, Michelle. Let's interviews over. We're done. Okay. So Michelle, but I will say that it is very rare for us to have a founder. I mean, everybody now CloudFlare is like this public darling poster child of entrepreneurship and you know, it's a $20 billion plus company, but it's rare for us to have a founder who's been there when it was just two people to now when it's 1,800. And so I want to start, especially for all the aspiring founders out there, to go back to the beginning to what it felt like when you were actually starting out CloudFlare. First of all, did you know, I think a lot of people say a chemistry business major, who's now the COO of a major deep cloud infrastructure company. Did you always have this vision that you wanted to be the head of a cloud infrastructure company, or a web infrastructure company, or how did you know that you wanted to take the leap and start and be a founder of CloudFlare? Yeah. So no is the answer. I did not always know that one day of it's going to run a cloud infrastructure company. And so I guess that should be encouraging, I hope, to many of you. But then it leads to well, then how do you know and how did you kind of discover it? And I think the second part of that is I'm a big believer that opportunities appear for everybody and often at all sorts of different frequency and times and those sizes and the quality of the opportunities vary. And sometimes you just have to go for it, I guess, is the short answer. But no, I had no idea. I grew up in a small city in the prairies of Canada. And I didn't even know what tech entrepreneurship was when I went way back when. And I studied chemistry because I wanted to be a doctor. And I just kind of kept my world kept getting bigger and bigger. And I was really curious. And I just was like a sponge I wanted to learn. I kept seeing, oh my god, you can do this. You can do that. And I just kind of my world kept expanding. And that was great. Life is a collection of experiences. Go collect a lot of them. So I was collecting a lot. And you know, at some point I was viewing my MBA at Harvard Business School. And I met this really super smart serial entrepreneur Matthew Prince. And Matthew always talked about something that he had done before. Project he had a hobby, a side project called project, Tony Pot. And he always talks about it over and over and over again, we were classmates. And finally, like, after a year and a half, I kind of said to him, Matthew, you always talk about project, Tony Pot. What is it? And he went on to describe that it was this open source community based project that helped track web spammers online. And I said, okay, how many people signed up for this? He said about 80,000 small businesses. And I thought, wow, 80,000 small businesses signed up for this. And I kind of said, how did they hear about you? You have no budget. No one knows what you're doing. How 80,000 people. And he's like, well, they talk about it. And I was like, what do they get for being part of Project Tony Pot. And he said, well, they help track web spammers online. And I was like, okay. And then what do you do with that? And he's like, well, Project Tony Pot goes and work with law enforcement agencies to take these spammers offline. So we basically have this ban turn. And at the end of it, I was like, I don't understand why this thing exists and why anyone signs up for it. And at this point, he kind of went from being gracious to frustrated with me. Because again, I didn't know a lot about the space. And he said, one day they wanted to create a service that helps protect them from the cyber attacks. And that was a big light bulb. I did not know a ton about the space. But I did know something that whatever I wanted to do next post my post graduation was I wanted to be part of something where I was really proud of the work that the team did. And what the work that the company did, that was a litmus test for me. And this idea of well, if we could help make the internet safer, whether you're an entrepreneur, bring up an idea or a developer with a side hobby project or a small business or a global 2000, I would be really proud to work on that. And that's it was just this curiosity in that now is turned into cloud flare, which is a publicly traded company. And I know a lot more today than I did one 12 years ago, but it was that conversation and seeking to understand where the light bulb came off. And I didn't know on day one, that's what we were going to turn this into a company. But I wanted to see where it went and that leads me here today with you Robbie. So and what a beautiful journey it is. But you, but just to be clear about that, because I want people to understand what it feels like in the early days, you didn't need to have certainty that this was going to be a $20 billion company. You just needed to have enough to know that you wanted to turn over another card and and and and lock arms with Matt and jump in. And what made that clear for you was this part of it was sound like was an emotional sentiment that you were going to make the world better. And it was just just classic, you know, customer validation when you're getting these proof points back from your customers, even though you might not have been a tech, you know, a web infrastructure expert. Well, you know, this is actually good point. So I was a student and it was actually really easy to pursue this idea as a student because it became something we did for school credit. And I was like, it was instead of taking a class, I signed up to do this special, you know, study with Matthew and the deliverable was to write a business plan and enter the business plan competition. So instead of taking a class for credit, so we got the luxury. It was a real privilege to explore this idea for school credit, which I needed to graduate. And so I think that's why some really good ideas come from students on campus because you have the luxury to do these sorts of things, especially if you can sign it up as a special project that you can do for school credit. It gave us a cover. I didn't have to put a job. I didn't have a job. It was a student and I think that that is different. That's why a lot of people who have full time jobs, maybe do things on the side because those are much harder decisions. And so we had that cover to say, let's just go explore this and what really happened the next three months was the following the first month. I just remember kind of this again back to curiosity world kept getting bigger. The first was this huge we're good business school students. So I mean, I wouldn't just go do something because you want to do it. You want to do something like makes an impact in my opinion. And so the first I had was wow, there is a huge problem here. And the way that I saw that was we did a survey to these 80,000 customers that they had tried to understand I didn't know about the space. And I remember I went into the survey and the survey asked questions like a typical business school student asked me saying, how much do you care what this problem and what are the solutions you're using today to solve about this problem. And we send it to 150 small businesses and or 500 small businesses, we got 150 people were applying, which is a high response rate. So that was proof point one. So clearly a lot of people responded. This was an engaged community. And the comments from there, you know, there was the quantitative where people mark things, but it was the qualitative answers that gave me this huge aha. And the quality of answers were things like web spammers are the scourge of the internet. They're criminals and they belong to be in jail. Now, you don't need to be a cloud infrastructure expert to realize holy smokes. There is a huge visceral pain point here. So like that was the first to have case there was clearly a problem. The next was part of the survey was like what are you used to solve it and all of these small businesses had no good solution. They're all using band aids like band aid homegrown solutions. So the bit versus how it was clearly, there's a problem. The next to offer us was, well, could we come up with a solution to the problem. And this is where the technical solution and being a differentiation, like really shown through. And we were really inspired about what David you all which was doing open DNS how he was helping deliver a better experience on the consumer side, the user side, we said, could we use DNS. We don't have to get into the technical details to do this deliver security for the business side. And that was a huge aha and was kind of a shift of where businesses were buying hardware to do this and small businesses couldn't afford the hardware. Could we create a cloud based solution. And we were again right at the perfect time of the in in in history and retrospect to start a company like cover. There was just a huge shift happening. And we happened to kind of stumble upon, wow, there's a problem here. We there is a way to deliver this as a service that not only makes it accessible to entrepreneurs and small businesses, but if we do a really good job over time, big companies too. So that was the second aha that we came up with a technical solution. So that was month two. And then month three is as a business school student, you got to be like, is there a business here. I think it's one thing to have a problem. Another way to have a solution. Can you can you build a business around it, which is something we'll talk more about. And again, you don't know we couldn't prove that. But we assumed yes. And it was those three things that by the time I graduated, I had another great job lined up. It was hard to walk away from that. Actually, I remember it was at LinkedIn, I went to LinkedIn's campus. And I remember I was sitting in that cafeteria talking to this person who's supposed to be my boss. And I said, you know, thank you so much for the offer. And this was LinkedIn was small as way before was going public. They were growing like a weed. I was excited to go there and I said, I have this idea. I we want to see where it goes. I'm going to go pursue my idea and said, I come here and you look me straight in the eye and he said, you are making the biggest mistake of your life because they were a rocket ship. And you know, when there's a when you're offered to see a rocket ship, you don't ask which seat you get on. And I kind of said, and most companies fail. I said, I get it, but I got to go see you. I have to see where this leads. And so it was not super clear. It was not easy. But those were my steps along the way. And if you ask Matthew, his were different. His calculus was different. And so I guess I like to tell the story because it wasn't super clear. I kind of felt more and more in love with the idea. And even when I decided to do it, I still wasn't sure. It still took a few more months after that before I was really sure. I was like, Oh, wow, we're really doing this. But. And so I think I think that people go through different processes. And that's okay. Sometimes I think you read these stories and you think, Oh, wow, people wake up one day with the best idea ever. And then the next day they built $100 billion company. That's amazing when that happens, but not all stories happen like that. I think it's very humbling and refreshing. It's like fumbling into love. Like you you know, there's a cascade of steps. But what I think is interesting is is that in that short period of time in three months, you sort of hit through that esilogism of classic product market bit like you got to product market bit in three months you validated that there was a huge pain point. It wasn't a vitamin. It was definitely a pain killer. You validated the approach. And you validated that that it was a great market. Now, I understand Michelle that so you have you say no to LinkedIn. You have all these beautiful badges. You have your Harvard MBA. You get funded by Venn Rock. And then I understand that even if we fast forward three or four years later, you've already raised a few rounds of financing. You have quite a few millions in the banks. Can you share with us how you're feeling at that moment in time? Sure. You know, it's so interesting. Yeah, well, I was going to say, you know, it's you want to be careful. You don't rewrite history. I guess is the is what you want to be careful of. And I sometimes I think back to, you know, we we came to the valley in 2009, the summer of 2009. But we really kind of launched our service to the world in September 2010. So we kind of consider that the start of cloudflowers history, even though we were working on it. We launched it. People could sign up. So September 2010 is kind of the date. And if I, if you had had me on the show in 2015, I mean, we were less than 200 people. We were a success. And I, you know, I would say that back then, I used to ask myself, I don't understand why anyone does startups. Let me just take a pause here just because I think this is so refreshing. And this is such a great sentiment because we don't get this expressed enough in 2015, you're five years in, you have 200 employees and you've raised how much money at this point in time. Do you remember? I remember, but I mean, for sure, I think what was it? I mean, a lot, a hundred and some hundred and twenty million dollars. I get a lot. So you, you are likely from all of your peers who are looking at you, they're thinking, man, Michelle, Michelle has she, she just, she, she chose right, she jumped on and she's living the dream. So unpause, but can you express how it actually feels at how you were feeling if we talked to you in 2015? Well, if you talk in 2015, what I would have said is I don't understand why anyone does it, because it's so hard. There are so many highs and lows. And now as I zoomed out and kind of have even more perspective, maybe the way that I best characterize it today or maybe as useful to this group is, I think if you, there are lots of ways to start companies and there are lots of different types of companies interested in my husband's and entrepreneur. And he is a kind of cash flow positive hasn't raised any money profitable company small team. And but we were always swing for the fence. So I guess this is kind of a swing for a fence point of view. And I think if you're going to start a company that swings for the fence and by that, I mean if you're swing for the fence, when I was starting a billion dollars was cool. Now that's not cool anymore. I think like that bar has been raised to ten billion dollar market cap and you know, like the kind of what was good enough keeps going up because the opportunities get bigger and it's easier and only sorts of some things are easier. But anyway, my point back to what I was saying, if you're if you're swing for the fence, which we were we have been from day one. We kind of knew clopper with other going to be big company or not exists as a company for us like a smaller medium size company just never really made sense for a bunch of reasons we can go through another time. But the my point of view on this is if you're swinging for the fence, the first two to five years is really hard. Like it's just and and why it's doesn't it's not the money. It's how do you get the talent? How do I convince all the engineers are listening to this call to come work for a 100 person company. It to be the founder makes a lot of sense to even be the first 20 employees makes a lot of sense. You get outsides equity grants. But like in between there's so much risk and there's so many things that don't work out. It's so hard to convince people and most people wait. It's like well come back to me once you've gotten to a hundred million dollar revenue run rate, which which is usually after five years some some companies do it faster. We're in a B2B space so that like that's kind of a sense. And so it's hard to get people who really have done it before to come work for you. So you're you're you're in the space where you need great talent to come work for you. But the proposition doesn't make a lot of sense to most professionals. They're like I'm just going to wait to you a little bit further along where it's de risk more and I'm going to get paid the same. And and and it's hard. There's so many things that go wrong actually Tom Eisenman a professor from Harvard Business School. He he was our advisor. He just wrote a book of a why startups fail and he actually quantified all the reasons why companies actually lose steam. And most like just because you get to your series B or C stage, which is where we were a lot of companies still fail at that stage. They just never reach their full potential. We know lots of those examples. And and so it's just so hard you're you're clearly onto something. But is it sustainable? How do you make sure competitors don't respond? How do you get the right people? Is it differentiated? Well, last there's lots of different pieces. So it's very, very hard. And so those first two to five years are just lonely. There's lots of highs and lows. You're working way you have way more work to do than you can possibly do for not just you as the founder of the whole team. Because a definition of the company startup is there's nothing there to begin with. You got to do everything. And and so it's really hard. So I remember 10 or 2015 with small group dinner and I remember once you're all the good things. And I was like, I don't know why anyone does this. And they got mad at me. They said I can't believe you're saying that. And you have a responsibility to carry this torch. And I just like it is so hard. I really think I can go get a job as an executive at a successful company. And my life would be a lot better. Now I'm on the other side of that. And I can see all the amazing things. And I would not trade it for anything. But if you were going back to Michelle in 2011 to 2015. And you're talking to your Michelle self when when she's in one of those moments when things are really hard. Knowing what you know now. Is there any advice you would give to founders when they find themselves in that phase. Yes. And this is where I think I hope there's more content and material and even resources available to founders. Because there's a lot of entrepreneurs who are starting companies right now. And I think they're going to face the same thing. And you hear a lot about depression. And I really think this these things are real. So the first is you surround yourself with great people and it kind of goes back to it's hard to get those. But it's just having the right people matter a ton. And one of the things that you know if I could go back in time is. As soon as you realize you have a real business, you need to start to build the team like you're running a business as well as you still build the awesome tech. Like the tech is cool. The else have to build a good business at some point. And I think that bringing in people who know how to scale businesses. A couple managers can make a huge difference and help things go smoothly. And so I think that we were pretty slow to do that. So that's one thing that I think if you can a couple of those people make a huge difference. And ultimately they make your life as a founder better because now you have an executive running an area where you're like, wow, they are better at that than I could ever be. And we work well together. And so I think trying to get to that state is very helpful to a business at that stage. That's one. The second is you have to take care of yourself. And I think some people don't exercise. Maybe they end up drinking too much. They don't have loved ones or friends or they don't ever do anything but work. Like they basically, they just are working all the time. I think that's unhealthy and unsustainable. And so finding a way to take care of yourself, whatever that means. That's different things. Some people, maybe it's working out more or prioritizing friends or prioritizing family or going on dates or whatever it is. I think that you are more than just your company and it's no one tells you that you got to go to for you got to do it yourself and in with a long list of things to you almost think it's selfish, but it's actually the inverse you got to take care of yourself so you can bring your best your best self to work. And again, no one is telling you that so you really have to do it yourself and and there's always more things to do, but you got to go home at the end of the day. You have to have other things going on besides just what your startup is. And so I think those are two things that come to mind that I wish somebody would write more of and become more common and investors would talk more about it. Because I just there's the real. And you know, I think there's sort of a functional classism in Silicon Valley that people don't talk about where we laud the big hairy audacious goal and the strategy and the, you know, the visionary founder who has this brilliant insight to go after this huge opportunity. And we sort of treat operations as a footnote as just something that you know that's just it's not real. It's not real strategy. It's not something with a premium on. Can you speak to that a bit because you're so first of all, you are the COO. Can you explain to our students and others what a COO is and why you chose to have the COO role? Sure. Well, it's interesting when you're a lot of large companies who are a lot larger than us would never have that title in a company kind of a CEO and then you've all these different department heads and there's lots of good reasons for that. And you take that back to company, you know, when you're building a company or start up, you have to create everything. So there's way more things to do than people to do it. Like that's just every growth company in the history of growth company. If you are getting everything in your to do list, my, my I'm guessing you have no customers. I think that that is just a definition. And so when you're building this company, there's just a lot to do. And so I actually think a lot of the reasons why growth companies kind of created the COO chief operating officer role is because it's a really strong generalist who complement often the CEO, the founder, in other parts of their business. And you companies bring this in and happen that Matthew and I made really good teammates and I kind of grew into that role and I earned it by great execution. And so that's it. And so really, you know, chief operating officer, I did a lot of things that Matthew, who was my business partner or CEO didn't have time for and he trusted me with and we made a really good partnership. And there's lots of great articles, Alison, who just pinkins, who was just the CEO of Gainsay wrote a great article, different types of COS. Why would you might need one and a lot of people like the roles you get to be kind of in charge of things, partner with the CEO in different areas. And again, it almost becomes a compliment to the CEO where they don't have time. And you know, when you think about it early on when you're two and a people, you don't have a general counsel yet or you might not have a, you might have just hired your head of people, you might not have all of the executives and all the different teams. But you need someone to say, okay, what about this or that and help remove obstacles and a lot of times CEO has become to do that fast for today. Now and again, it's changed so many times over the time, but today I run all the go to market. So sales and marketing and customer support. It's how do we cloudflare interact with our customers? How do we grow? How do we make sure they're happy and they're growing with us? And then and then the people team also reports up into me. And so it's changed. That's not where it was when I, you know, when I grew into this title years ago, but this is where it is today. So Michelle, do you feel like there are first do you feel like the shift or the focus on strategy over operations is ill placed. Do you feel like we do a disservice by not putting more of a light on the need to scale operationally. And what's required for that. I think that's a fair question. I might characterize it a little bit differently. And just from what I see, especially because there's so many engineers in the audience, I kind of want to say, maybe I think what you're saying is true. I might just even position it a little bit differently. I would say we are a very technical company. Cloudflare builds infrastructure for the internet. We move a lot of bytes around the internet for a lot of like over 25 million million internet properties. It's a lot. We have a huge responsibility. We are super technical and super geeky. We're optimizing very low level code. Everyone at Cloudflare is very technical just inherently what we do. And what I would say is earlier on like we just we were we loved the tech. We love that we we had came up with this differentiated technical technology and we were celebrated for that. And I think I see that a lot in Silicon Valley where technical founders were you're celebrated for the tech and we loved that and it was amazing. We still love that today. What I think that we discounted early on and you described it as operations. I would even make it broader than that. What is really cool and I don't think it's spoken enough about is when you have built the amazing tech is how do you build a great business to partner with it. That doesn't just happen by ox accion. It's just like good tech technology doesn't just happen by accident. You need to like be thoughtful in the architecture and decisions matter and you got to you don't have to grind out bottlenecks and capacity constraints like all those sorts of things. The same thing is on the business side where I think some technical folks that I've seen early on or even technical founders they almost outsource the business building to other people and they are almost bored by that. And I think that one of the things that I've realized along the way and how we realize it but I wish we'd realized it even earlier is what is really magical is if you have amazing technology with a great business and an awesome and awesome team. And then and then and then what I think is icing on the cake is a great impact in the world. That is how you build something truly magical and I don't think that gets spoken about enough of the business building. I think people kind of see that as almost beneath them and actually that's what makes magic. You need it's an important piece of the magic because that's how and just maybe why I would say it's eventually you get measured on your financial metrics compared to others. It's very hard to measure technical differentiation. You know you know it you can't see it in numbers but you can very much compare how is your revenue compared to somebody else what's your gross margin how fast you're growing. These are the sort of things that early on no one's the chemo but you know 10 years later that's what the expectation is and you want metrics that look even better than somebody else because your technology is so good. And so I think more appreciation for the business building would go a long way for some of those technical founders. So then can I ask you to share on the business on if there are any insights on the business building piece of it. I understand that that you know one of the purposes of ETL is to have the current leader entrepreneurs share their insights so that the next generation doesn't have to go through the same struggles and can hopefully also even deepen what they can contribute to the generation that comes after that. And so with that spirit of mine are there any insights that you would want to share that you wish you had known when you had started. Well one is care about the business metrics so you know I'll give you an example of that is I remember we hired our first executive and he actually still works for us and he came in to help run sales and. He from such a hard time we're like no that's not cool our customers are no we can't do that no we can't raise prices no no no everything was no and I think he was just like okay if our technology is so good and delivering so much value we should also be able to capture some of that value and again I think. We made things a lot harder for him his first few quarters than we needed to and again now I think we've found a way where we deliver a lot of value for all the customers but you still have to. Be able to capture the value as a business and you get measured on your revenue and your revenue growth and can you do it with a high gross margin and all these sorts of things. I did not appreciate that the first few quarters that we had ahead of sales everything was kind of like no we're not going to know we're not going to send an email to our customers that's lazy like it's just like we made everything harder than it needed to be again we've gotten a lot smarter about that which is good. A couple of other things that I think that we're really helpful that I think might be helpful for this group growth solves a lot of problems and so actually growing quickly solves a lot of problems you don't have to get everything right I think people have this assumption that all the successful companies have everything perfect and the truth is they only have a couple things really perfect. They've got a couple things really right and the other 98 things are a disaster but because they're got two or three things really right they're growing quickly and it gives them time to go fix the things that aren't working without the public seeing and that's really not intuitive and that that I just think knowing that matters a lot you get grow quickly and you grow quickly by getting a couple things right and then it gives you more turns at the bat to fix the things that aren't working and then it kind of adds up so that was. Can I push on that a bit because I think a lot of founders wrestle with should I optimize for growth or profit profitability and being sustainably profitable especially in the early days how do you decide if you should just if you should focus on growth at the expense of profitability and I or maybe the answers you do both but for the founders that are struggling with what their North Star metric should be if it should be growth or engagement or monetization and profitability how do you decide. I think it kind of goes back to and if you're swinging for the fences or not so you were sitting for a fence we were literally we wanted to be a huge company we wanted to be you know a 20 billion dollar mark kept company and now you know now there's a new goal post that we're aiming for and we knew this early like we knew this super super early in that case you have to grow I mean profitability means nothing like it like it doesn't matter if you're swinging for the fence is now the risk. If you are growing then then then you're in trouble but growth matters a lot more I would say if you're like my husband who is not is not team outside funding and doesn't care about one day being a public company and wants to deliver good service with this multi well they are doing something it's a growth plus profitability it's different they don't have the same constraints and making different calculus and you do make different decisions because of that early on I will say. If you're going to do something else else on the intuitive we we were focused on growth really important but our revenue was slow at first our first the first way we made money early on in cluff was we had a free service and a $20 a month service and then years later we added a $200 a month service and now we have companies paying us over millions of dollars a year I will tell you it is so hard to grow revenue when you're charging $20 a month it's just like you do a lot of create a spreadsheet you're like wow I got a son of a lot of customers and then $200 a month you're like wow a grow faster but you know to get to that. $100 million and now a billion revenue and whatnot like a grow slowly and so anyhow my point is early on and again this was very cluffler specific we cared about growth but revenue was a metric that was changing slowly for us because the types of customers that we originally went to market with we started with small businesses and we knew the long term we'd go to larger organizations but that took years it always takes longer than you think and so we picked five metrics that changed really quickly to measure our growth and revenue was not one of them and I actually think that this is another thing that was unintuitive where you as a founder get to choose what metrics you're going to measure get measured on with your board or your investors and you can pick them pick ones that matter to your business based on your point of view and so we picked other metrics that change a lot quicker than revenue for cluffler because early on it just moved very slowly and you give the examples of what those metrics were. Yeah so for us early on again we start with small businesses or developers or again hobbyists like many of these engineers putting their hobby sites on us because we had to build so how does cluffler what is cluffler do we make the internet faster safer and more reliable we literally build infrastructure for the internet which means we have to buy a lot of servers and routers and switches and by the way those are really expensive and that's also when you just snap your fingers and do tomorrow it's taken 12 11 years of a labor of love to build this global network so today we're in 200 cities with a lot of points of presence and that's how because we're in 200 cities if you are I don't know trying to access your schoolwork from Paris France you get routed to counselors Paris France data center we make things every fast and do all this magic to make it fast and safe if you're in Cape Town South Africa you hit our Johannesburg and then what versus if you're in San Francisco you hit our San Jose so we're cover the world so everyone else doesn't have to and early on we measured by how much traffic is going through our networks we said page views so we said and if you think about that if robby's blog dot com signs up for cluffler early on robby's blog I don't know how many blog posts and how many views did you get to your blog Robby I don't know a thousand and so it'd be that plus somebody's I don't know somebody some some entrepreneur had a hot website and they put it on some maybe they were doing a hundred thousand page views and so actually page views how many page views we powered through cluffler's infrastructure was actually one of the metrics we use for the first four years five I think was four years every board meaning first thing we showed on the board deck because page views changed faster the number of customers because it was like one customer brought so many page views and we had to process that it made a lot of sense in our case but it didn't represent necessarily revenue but it just showed how much were we delivering on our process on our promise to help make our customers traffic faster safer and more reliable another one that we cared a lot about was on our side you know build a service like cluffler we were really obsessed about cost and and and really obsessed about cost to deliver the service and so we said okay how much does this cost us to deliver and we were constantly trying to bring that down and so that was one of the metrics we used and so these moved fast they changed really quickly and again back to early on you have to make momentum as an entrepreneur you got to make progress it like things have to be changing and progressing forward it's like if you play basketball the balls got to go down the core like it's you just want to be constantly making progress against what you're doing that's how you get people to come work for you so you get investors excited so you get partners excited if if you talk to a person who you want to work for you on January and July everything's the same at your company they're going to be like this makes no sense you want a lot of new things and change and progress along the way and so we pick metrics that changed a lot that showed a lot of progress that were important for business and I think that served us really really well and revenue wasn't one of them that's so great thank you thank you thank you I'm going to turn it over to the students for questions so we're going to kick it off we have our first question is what advice would you give to a young person debating whether to go to a large established company or take the leap and join a start up small firm if you're early on career I'd go to a growth company or and so I guess it depends what you mean by start up versus large established so I think life is a collection of experiences you want to collect a lot of them and so going to either the market leader or a high quality growth company serves you really well in your early in your career you learn a ton there are more resources you meet people you might meet your future business partner there future co-founder or they go and get recruited somewhere else and they bring you with you because they bring them they recruit you with them because you're so good at what you do so I would optimize for growth I'd look at companies that have asked their growing and the manager that you're going to work for who you work for matters a ton and managers that are doing a really good job or rising stars within organizations have been there a little bit of time are good people to bet your career on early because they they will as they are career rises their teams rise with them and I that's how I would prioritize it I personally would stay away for companies that are growing slowly by slowly like less than 10 or 20% your over here there's just so many other exciting things growth growth gives you a lot of opportunity you get to see a lot of things That's great thank you the next question is I really sincerely appreciate you're talking about mental health how would you respond to people being judgmental or critical about not working all the time and taking time for yourself Yeah, um, I think I think that's changing I hope I really hope it's changing I don't think every company is like that I guess is what I'm trying to say and so if you're a talented especially your technical and an engineer you should go find a company where it's not like that I mean look you're going to be engaged you're going to have a lot of things to do great but you also want to be a place where people have something else going on they're like I Don't think you want to be in a place where your sleep we're being being at your desk at 10 o'clock at night It's considered a badge of honor. I guess it's made me another way to say it And I I think there are lots of companies that are no longer like that and so seek them out. It's talent I feel like talent has the upper edge right now. There's there's it's there's a lot of people looking for great people to come work there And so be deliberate and be purposeful where you go and if you go somewhere where it's not valued then maybe think about Can I help change it because maybe they just haven't gotten to it yet and they need someone to help change it And if not maybe go somewhere else where it is valued because I do think it's not One company in the history one company in the whole world that cares about it I think there's more and this is becoming more topic So I think it's a grown trend and I think that's a good thing And can I ask you Michelle just to follow up on that? I mean you're married to it an entrepreneur So you both are like you both took the red pill in double doses You have Sorry, you both jumped in you jumped into the matrix And you both took the leap so sometimes you have these couples that are hedged you have like one person who is You know either dedicated to the couple and the family or or one person who's taking the risk or something like that But I'm curious just of tailing this question Uh have you had any insights on work life balance between your competing interests with you what you want on your personal life what you want on your professional life And are there any times when you have this sense of worry about being judged because you're not putting enough in Uh, but also wanting to protect what you know you need for your own personal health Or your sphere of health that you want to protect Yeah, there's so many ways to so many pieces to that question Robbie Maybe it's all the things that I'll I mean I and again I if I don't answer exactly and somebody wants to follow up It's fine, you know one of the things I will say and again, I'm I'm married. I have two kids and I'm I When I was graduating from my business school. I really wanted I was super ambitious in my career I really wanted to be have like a life partner and I really wanted to have a family And so I like wanted all three and I happened to Mary a partner who wanted that too and it was and and and that's you know 10 years later I've sometimes you know the last year you reflect on your life. I feel like wow I've done it I'm like love my career a happy life partner and we have really great kids and and I love that and I'm Very satisfied by that and and proud of that and I like I purposely sought that out and kind of made decisions along the way to help tilt the risk-proward ratio in my favor And I'm proud of that and so I think that that's point one that if that's something that you want I think it's possible and now not everybody wants that and that's fine too, but that it is and so You know my husband's career. He's also Then lots of super interesting things and he left a great job to go be a founder because he really want to have the entrepreneurship experience and again He's doing it a different way, but it's super successful in other ways And I love that I'm his biggest champion and I would say he's my biggest champion and I Hope lots of people in their life get to experience that since it's great when you can find a life partner who believes in that When we went public I brought my two kids to the New York Stock Exchange and we opened the bell together So if you go look at photos like my kids are there and I often reference mom's big day in New York Do you remember mom's big day in New York? I mean they were three and five. They knew I do it going public means But it's like this is mom's big day and you and it was really important for you to be there to see it and to celebrate together like I just I don't know I love that I've been able to I don't know Carve that path for myself and and for my family. So I guess there's that piece. I don't I don't worry about getting judged I have put a lot of pressure on myself. I want to win I want to win. I want to be super successful. I want to win. I want to do the best work. I can I want to be proud of the work Can I think that when you're at a growth company the what was good enough What was good enough last month is no longer good enough today and and That is a set like that's just the reality of a growth company like What was good enough last year is the bar gets raised every single year of what because you know the expectations go up and The bigger cost customers and just the expectation bigger team We have almost two thousand people just different than when you have a hundred people just different and I think that you have to grow You have to want you got to be like wow I did that poorly. I got to fix that and so I don't ever feel judged ever I think it's more about a desire to do a really good job and to win and and and and I It's fun being part of a winning team like it feels so good to be on a winning team I played a lot of sports growing up. It's so fun to be on a winning team It's so fun to be on a winning team where you where you do it as a team like I think what I'm proud of about Cluffer It's like a team. It doesn't matter how good I am or Matthew It's our amazing team. It's best part of my job with people like it to work with and I go to meetings sometimes I'm like oh my god. I'm so lucky I get to work with that person like I like I love that feeling and it's again I think if you can find that in your career I've had a lot of jobs where that's not the case and so I really Value that I have that and I try not to look at the grasses greener where okay? Not everything is perfect things are hard and there's never enough time and you're like oh my goodness Like there's lots of things that are hard, but you're just like but I'm showing up and I want to win And I'm a player on the field and I'm gonna stay here as long as I possibly can keep earning my my spot on the team And is it more joyful now in the entrepreneurial journey? Is there a moment as you reflect back on the last 12 years where you had the most joy? I remember I don't know some people I went for coffee with someone named Chris Chris Niel he he he's somebody in the valley and And I remember and said my goal and this is before when the public is to enjoy the journey more because I like I used to kind of get bogged down. It's think about turning companies are highs and lows and 10 times a day early on like literally You go from oh my god, I just closed this person to oh my god the company's not gonna exist like it's like 10 times a day that these are This huge highs and lows that over time gets spread out as you become successful when you build a business You build a team and there's still many highs and many lows, which is much more spread out And so it was a couple years ago A couple years after that dinner where I'm like why does anyone do this? So it was a couple years after that that I just realized I think I think it's back to Kind of back to this mental health piece if you read a lot of the mindful mindfulness books It's about like just finding the joy in the moment I remember Jamie my husband was saying like yeah like so what are kids are crying? I'm gonna try to enjoy that more and I kind of laughed. I'm like he's like, but that's what it's about And so I kind of took that and I was like you know what I'm gonna enjoy the journey more And so it was I think it was in 2018 so a couple years before you're gonna have for you a public And I just said I'm gonna enjoy and so when things are bad when there's that low at work I'm gonna be like how could I learn from this and I really like it was like a mental switch overnight That I'm like I'm just gonna enjoy the journey more and that's been I it has been more enjoyable Since I've said I'm gonna enjoy the highs and the lows and when we're in a low I'm gonna be like What can I learn I'm grateful to be with a teammate who wants to solve this together We're gonna get out stronger means if we're if it's a low point that means tomorrow's gonna be better like all these sorts of things And so I did make a mental switch and I have enjoyed it more since I've done that You have so it's not just okay It's real it's real. It's not it's it's not a destination It's it's not like oh my god I'm gonna go public and everything's gonna be magically better No, it's not the problems get bigger the expectations get higher and so you just I just wish You should just I've gotten much more comfortable as I've enjoyed it more along the way I think there are few people who can actually say that With the authority that you can because I think now that you're at a $20 billion company not even a billion or 10 billion or 20 billion It is you can see you have the authority to say that the goal post keeps shifting even when you're 20 now you're thinking about 200 or or end and and and so you You know the achieving the goal is A relentless pursuit the goal will keep shifting and you'll never ultimately Ultimately Be satisfied in that sense, you know, I remember I went to a dinner. It was uh it was uh, you know And as you get more successful you get invited to a lot of things and pros and cons to that And so I got invited to this dinner and it was a new fun that somebody was sitting up and then their LPs there This Lp basically said we're going to this fund is about investing in companies that will be one day worth a hundred billion dollars or more And I was so offended because I you know, we were well-posed to billion dollar we were passed the billion dollar market cap But I just was like you throw a hundred billion dollars as a new goal post just like it's casual I kind of was like I feel like that's Dishonoring all the hard work and all the other amazing businesses that get built between now and there I'm like sure someone might be big winners like that but Not every company has to be a big winner like that to be considered worthy of your time. I was really offended Anyway, so those are the sorts of things that you have to deal with. Yeah, the the goal post keep moving and and Again, you can either fight it or you can just embrace it and say all right. Let's see what else we can accomplish We have two more questions This first one is wants to double click on the the sentiment about how in the context of the 2000 feeling that you were relaying that you had along the lines of why does anyone do a startup Can you please share additional reasons if any beyond team building that made you feel that way Of why to do it or why I felt like not to do it. Yeah, why you felt like not to do it I just the first two to five years is so hard when you're swinging for the fence. It's so hard It's just it's you know, you don't get paid you financially You're not making a lot of money early on again. There's some exceptions, but you're just not there's just not enough resources I mean you're getting compensated but not Well, and so you're so you're working incredibly hard For not a lot of direct compensation in the moment again, it's an investment for the future and and for some people That's not a big deal. You have family money or whoever but like For my husband, I was a big deal like we just didn't have a lot of that So it was just like oh my god like we lived in a studio apartment for many years So two of us like anyway, so so I can laugh about it now, but anyway, so there's that um It's so stressful like I mean you are But you have to make decisions that you were totally ill and quick to make and but there's no one to ask like because you're in charge So you have to make a decision and you think that sounds great until you're like wow These are people's lives that you're living like that you that you're responsible for like they're they have a family They're relocating their family to move wherever to work with you And you have to make sure that you can make their payroll and you know that your company is gonna actually exist So I think those sorts of things that so you're just making decisions that you are feel really unprepared and you don't Have Sure you can call a board member you might call somebody But like you could have run out of people to call and nobody really knows and actually what really is half hard is you face of these hard Questions you ask five smart people Who you really respect what to do and they give you five different answers and then you're like a deer and headlights You're like oh my goodness. Okay, so I have a hard decision I just asked five people that I respect and they all give me different answers What do I do and and you got to make a call and and so that's really um tricky You know again for us this was five years in I had a lot of friends that were entrepreneurs started companies at the same time Some were going really well some Literally word no successful and so you see that too you realize Just because you start a company doesn't mean you're gonna be successful. It actually is it you have a ton of You you have a lot of responsibility and whether it is going to be successful or not and and so I took that responsibility I took that to heart Matthew did too And so that was just you kind of say oh my goodness like where responsible for this whether we make a good caller bad call Actually impacts a lot of things the quality the outcome here and so that stuff is the it's hard to put into words But when you find yourself you're just like wow I have to make a call But it's a way I'm not really equipped to do and it matters like there's implications to a bad decision And you see it really quickly and just never enough resources to go around And so it's just you're working all the time and you're not paid very well and you got to make hard calls all the time You The entrepreneurial thought leader series is a Stanford e-corner original production The stories and lessons on Stanford e-corner are designed to help you find the courage and clarity to see and seize opportunities Stanford e-corner is led by the Stanford Technology Ventures program and Stanford's Department of Management Science and Engineering To learn more please visit us at ecorner.stanford.edu
