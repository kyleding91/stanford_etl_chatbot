 You were listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at edcorner.stanford.edu. I'm thrilled to welcome John to Stanford. We've got a terrific conversation today with him. Let me tell you a little bit about his background and then we'll just dive in, have about a half hour of conversation and then a half hour or so of your questions. Or more, if you have more than a half hours worth of questions. John Mello is the CEO of Amorous. Amorous is a leader in synthetic biology to make useful things. In fact, the company is so terrific at what it does that it won the World Economic Forum's Tech Pioneer Award for 2006. And I think if you don't know the company, after a few minutes you'll understand why they won this award and why we've invited John to be here. Prior to Amorous, John spent eight years at BP, the big giant oil company, or energy company I should say. And he led the North American Energy Business. And while he was also a general manager in the company, he also presided over the complete repositioning of the BP brand, which I'm sure all of you have seen the Beyond Petroleum positioning that the company's taken. And we can talk about that as well. Clearly in his career, John worked in counting here in the Bay Area and also in entrepreneurial ventures in Silicon Valley. So he had a transition from entrepreneurship to big company and back to entrepreneurship. So we'll also talk a little bit about that today. So please join me in welcoming John Mello. So to start, maybe for those that don't know, tell us what the heck synthetic biology is and what Amorous uses it for. Very question. I'm always asking that same question of myself actually. It's interesting. You can think of synthetic biology as sort of the magic inside of a box. And that box really being in very simple terms, a bug. In this case, a microbe that we all know in the world is yeast. So if you think of what yeast is, what Amorous does is reprograms yeast so that yeast can do what we wanted to do when you feed a trigger. That's simply what we do. Another way I think of it is it's almost like writing the operating system for yeast. And then getting yeast to do what we want once you put it in a fermentation tank. That's what we do. And what do you do to rewrite the operating system of the yeast so that it does these things? And don't tell us any secrets because we're recording. Yeah, very good. I'll try to avoid that. It's another simple way to think about it. It's DNA and RNA. So we basically program yeast in our own coding of DNA and RNA to get the pathway we've controlled or do control inside of yeast to do what we want. And if you would mind, give the students a sense for what this looks like when you do it. What's the physical environment like where this happens and who's doing this stuff to the yeast? That in a way is what makes us very unique. That's not, I mean, typically you'd have biologists assessing how a microorganism performs and then deciding what they want to do to it. What we do is we really integrate fermentation capability, the chemical engineers, microbial engineers, and biologists together to formulate what I'll call kind of, to formulate a hypothesis to what's happening inside the microbe and then develop a set of experiments where they then, in a lab, organize the experiments, go to work on them, and then we put them in small flask glasses, shake them all night long, and see what the bugs do. And so let's talk a little bit about the underlying technology. I was doing a little bit of research before the, before today's session. And I found this terrific article from Time Magazine and it's called Industrial Microbes. And it talks about the fact that yeast among other things and other, and some types of bacteria, et cetera, are used to make all sorts of things like acetone, alcohol, riboflavin, which I think is in total cereal is the last place I saw it. Penicillin, which I'm allergic to, gluconic acids, which is apparently used in pharmaceuticals. What fascinated me about this article was that the date is March 26, 1945. And so this apparently is something that's been around, or this idea of getting small plants or animals to manufacture useful things. What's new about what you're doing with it, and why is this company so exciting and special? I think that's a great piece of context. And keeping in mind that I am not the strongest scientific person in our company, by far, that is. If I step back, one of the interesting things about the microbes is we've been using them to get drunk and feed ourselves for a very long time, whether it's bread or wine. At the company or in general. Both. Okay. I'm with you. That's, you know, it's actually interesting at the company. One of our favorite events is breaking in a new fermentation tank. The way we typically break in a new fermentation tank is that we make a small batch of beer. And you know, some of the folks would say that depending on how good the beer taste is a good indicator of the success of that tank. I'm not sure that's true, but nonetheless, what's different today is the scale and the information technology and the processing power available to us. A very simple model that I've started to use is kind of the concept of Moore's Law, and how Moore's Law is applying to the biological pathway and the engineering work that we're doing today. So, you know, in 1940, we didn't have that kind of computing power available to us in the lab. And then secondly, I think the other, the other different challenge, and we face this every day, not only in the core technology, but in the culture we're trying to build, is that, you know, there's a big difference between trying to get kind of try to make the simple for you a bug producing product at the equivalent of $10,000 or a million dollars of barrel of oil equivalent cost versus getting it to produce it at a $60 barrel of oil equivalent cost. And that kind of industrial processing, the kind of need to get the bugs to work in an industrial environment in a very low cost way, I think is the big difference between, you know, what you might find in the 1940s and what you might find today. It's the application of the core technology and the underlying or the supportive information technology to help advance the progress and the development of the bug. So, after the party's over and the beer has been decanted and everybody's had a great time and presumably you clean this container after you're done, what do you actually make for sale or what are you planning to make for sale? Our first product is Artemisan, which is an anti-malarial compound that we've licensed to and are partnered with Sonofi eventas. And that product is intended for the sub-Saharan Africa market. And you know, the success of that product is really something, you know, most products that we get involved in and my history has been, you know, you measure success by the amount of gross margin you can achieve or the amount of sales you can achieve in a period of time. With this product, it's really the number of lives you could save. And we're targeting 600,000 lives a year as what I consider to be the successful outcome of the Artemisan project. So that's our first product. It's a project that was initially funded by the Gates Foundation and that's really what's given us the head start on a technology platform that can be adapted and transferred to products beyond the pharma industry. Our second product is a renewable diesel. And the renewable diesel is a pretty unique molecule. It is a hydrocarbon that's fully compatible with today's infrastructure. And interestingly to think about it, it's a renewable replacement for petroleum-based diesel. The product is as good or better than petroleum-based diesel and it's from a renewable source. So that's our second product. We have jet fuel as a follow-on. And then we have several chemicals, isoprene, V1 of them that are markets we're currently looking at for renewable chemicals. So it's pharmaceutical, really focused on saving lives, focused on making or doing our part to have a positive impact on the planet and then looking at what we can do from the renewable plastics or renewable chemical side of the world. On the malaria drug or the Artemisan, do I understand you right that you're going to sell that at cost at your cost? Actually, we're not going to sell it at all. Our view in our initial agreement with the Gates Foundation was that we would give the technology away for free for distribution to the developing world. Our view is that as we study the market, we realized that the reason why children die today of malaria beyond catching it. So you've got great opportunity to prevent it with nets and other mechanisms. But once they get it, the only reason why they die for the most part is that they can't afford the medicine. So our whole focus has been how do we reduce the cost and make it affordable and we want to do our part to reduce the cost by taking out the cost of the highest ingredient that goes into an act of treatment today. That ingredient was basically $2.40 to $2.50 of the cost that we're trying to take down to 24 cents by taking any margin or taking any sales or license opportunity from the product away from the market. And have the other suppliers and supply chain have they agreed to similar kind of treatment or are they still going to profit from this? I don't think they're in the same mindset that we are. How did you get in that mindset? Did you have a debate about this? Was it clear and everybody was on one side or how did that conversation go? There was really not much debate. I think the interesting thing about this is to start off as an interesting science experiment. And because of that, there wasn't debate. It was like, what do I say? We get to do great science. The Gates Foundation gets to pay for it. And we get to distribute it and save lives. Now, what's wrong with that picture? It started off really on that basic premise. I see. I see. And how did you discover? It seems to me an odd connection between anti-malarial medication and synthetic hydrocarbons. Can you help us understand that bridge or that connection? That to us was somewhat accidental. I mean, it's hard. I'm sure that at some point, somebody will write about how well planned that was. I think it was more accidental than a plan. It was kind of an outcome of working on the Art of Miscent and Project that we realized actually the pathway or the best pathway inside of yeast to get to Art of Miscent and is actually a pathway that's great for making all long chain, complex structured carbons. When we realized that we realized, now wait a sec, that actually opens us up to, first of all, being quite distinctive because people usually work on simple carbons, short chain carbons or alcohols. So quite distinctive in the product set. In addition to that, it allows us access to 50,000 different molecules. So this wasn't quite a dynamic learning when we realized that we had many more markets we could go into as an accident of picking a pathway that worked best to make the anti-malarial. So it's all about the core pathway of the bug that actually enables us access to all these different markets. And so I'm guessing this was a highly positive meeting where you discovered that you could accidentally make hydrocarbons that were renewable and quite useful, I guess. So everybody was pretty fired up about this. Yeah, it's the other, I guess, Miss Nomer. Unfortunately, these don't happen in single discovery, aha, meetings, right? It's one of these things that, you know, over, probably over a year of just constant conversation and understanding what it was we were really doing that we realized what we really had. And then it became a matter of choice. And I mean, I can tell you when we brought in our series A, our first financing, our first equity-based financing, at that time, we still did not realize the markets we had access to or the potential of the core technology. At that point, I mean, John DeWer will say this, I think openly, I mean, he was making a bet. He basically loved the team. He thought it was interesting technology and he thought, you know, with this team and that technology, there's got to be a market somewhere. So, and he loved the cause. I think the cause was one of the initial hooks. He couldn't, he couldn't resist the cause. Yeah. And it was a great team with an interesting technology. Yeah. So, maybe let's shift and talk about the hydrocarbons for a minute. You said that a diesel, a synthetic diesel, really, it's not a substitute. It works in the same way that regular diesel does. Can you talk a little bit about how you picked that of all the things you could make with the hydrocarbons that were spun off of the artimizan? Yeah. When I joined the company, we started to think about our product selection from the market in. Instead of thinking about, you know, what can the technology make? We started with, what does the world need? And we started with really understanding diesel today and biodiesel today. And we realized that biodiesel today had some limitations. And there, there wasn't a real scalable, renewable diesel available. So, it was from that perspective, kind of market in that we realized there were three attributes that would be critical for renewable product to win. The first is it had to have either as much or more energy content than the existing product. Because if you took energy away, it would be a compromise for the whole chain, especially the end consumer. The second thing is the C-tain level, which for diesel is kind of the equivalent of octane. It had to have, you know, as much or more C-tain and petroleum-based diesel. And the third was temperature. We realized that one of the weaknesses with the oil-based, seed oil-based biodiesels is that they got really sticky and gummy and thick anywhere below 10 or 12 degrees Fahrenheit. So, we decided to focus on a molecule that would have a freeze point of about 40 degrees Celsius below zero. So, that's kind of what we did. We said, what are the most important attributes in the market from the customer's perspective? And then once we chose the attributes, we wanted to be very distinctive in. Then we asked ourselves, could we make that molecule? Well, we actually had an interim step which was from a chemistry perspective. We asked ourselves which molecules in the world have similar attributes. Then we got the third step which was, okay, so there's a set of molecules that could work. And we got to the third step then of saying, so can we actually make this? Can we get the bugs with the pathway we control to make that molecule? And that whole process beginning to end. Once we knew what the right attributes were to focus on was about a six-week process. And we think that's pretty distinctive, going from targeting what we want from an attribute perspective to making it in the lab, getting the bugs to produce it in six weeks. We think it's pretty cool. We did the same thing with jet. I mean, jet was the same thing. We had the guys at Virgin specifically Richard Branson. Jet fuel, your talking fuel. The jet fuel approach was exactly the same. Richard Branson approached us and said, hey, you know, if you thought about the jet market, we said, well, not really. And then, you know, pushed back and said, you know, can you make a business case for us? What's the business case for jet? Within a week, his team did a great job. They came back with a perfect slide deck. And the business case, the essence of the business case was really simple. European market is moving in the direction of carbon tax for jets or jet fuel. We think this is a problem. It can have a dramatic negative impact on the airline industry. And we think the airline industry needs a better solution. That was kind of the essence of it. I mean, it didn't quite say all that, but that was the essence of it. And then that was good enough for us to say we ought to focus on a distinctive jet molecule. And it's exactly the same process I described for you with diesel. We asked ourselves, what would make a real distinctive jet fuel? What attributes aren't available today that if we really push the envelope on them would make us distinctive, then we looked at the chemistry and asked ourselves, so what molecule is falling that area? And then went to the last step, which was getting the bugs to make it. And that was again about six weeks. So we're now in this mode of, you know, if there's an interesting molecule to make out there, let me say it differently, if there's a problem to solve in an interesting market to go after, we could probably get to it if it's a complex carbon. That's the other thing we're clear on. We're clear what we're good at and what we're not. We know if it's a complex carbon, we're very good at it. Long chain, complex carbon. If it's not, we probably should let somebody who's better at making beer than we are at making it. Fair enough. What I'm curious about is when you combust or when you put the synthetics, the diesel or the jet fuel through a conventional diesel engine or a jet engine, does it burn in a different way or is the emission characteristics somehow different than the stuff we make out of crude oil? The emission characteristics are the same. You were basically burning a hydrocarbon in the chamber. And I'll try to explain this is actually very important for us. We had to make a choice in the kind of molecule we selected. And we had to make a choice driven by time to market. And we kind of stood back and said, you know, if time to market is really important, trying to prove to the world that we're developing a molecule that's going to redefine what diesel is, is probably going to be a pretty hard road that's going to add two to three years in certification. So we decided actually to go a very different way. We decided to look at the makeup or what I like to call the cocktail of diesel because diesel is really many molecules blended together. We looked at that cocktail and we asked ourselves in that cocktail, which molecule could we blend at a much higher level inside the cocktail, still get diesel to perform at the current or better specification than is already approved, the ASTM spec for diesel. And based on that, could we get to market faster? And that's exactly what we did. So our molecule is a blend in current petroleum diesel and blended up to 50%. We meet or exceed the specifications of current petroleum diesel. And that's the same thing with jet. It's a different blend rate, but it's the same approach. We decided, let's not go invent the world and try to find a different molecule. Let's find a molecule that's currently in the cocktail that actually does what the world needs. And then let's blend that molecule at a much higher level than the industry has traditionally done because we can make it at a lower cost. That's the approach we've taken. And the cost profile of making this stuff, how do you keep the cost at a breakthrough low level? It sounds very expensive to me. Yeah, not easy. That's actually the second part of the magic. The first part of the magic is can you actually make the darn thing? The second thing is can you make it in a cost-effective way at scale. And we have focused that on several dimensions. One is keeping the manufacturing process as simple as possible. So we decided, you know, one of the key factors in cost is capital cost. You know, there's a fantastic product out today. There's two issues. It's not very good for the environment and it's very costly to produce. And that's what I'll call the coltoliquids method of making either diesel or jet. You get a great molecule. It's a fantastic product, but it costs, you know, two to three billion dollars to build a basic plant. And, you know, you don't produce a lot when you spend two to three billion dollars. And you have an issue with carbon sequestration and what you do with CO2 for the environment. So our focus has been, actually, that could be our advantage. How do we pick a scalable process that's low cost? And we decided, you know, the good news is we're working with microbes and they'd love fermentation. So we focused on a fermentation process as the manufacturing process to make the product. And by doing that, you know, we also decided we wanted to make our scale up what I like to call capital light. So instead of building a complete new infrastructure for manufacturing our product, we decided let's go where there's available capacity and fermentation today. Let's convert that fermentation capacity from doing whatever it does today to making diesel from a scalable feedstock. So that's the first part of cost is that exact model. You take an existing process, make sure it's low cost, and make sure you can scale it with low capital. Our conversion process today is we can take an ethanol mill in Brazil for about 30 million dollars converted from making 40, 50, 60, 75 million gallons of ethanol a year to making the equivalent in diesel a year. And that's a pretty breakthrough model for how you go to market with our technology. We didn't say let's start from scratch, let's start with what's out there, let's find a low cost conversion and let's get that plant to make our product. The second and I think as hard part of cost is getting the microbes to be super efficient. If you think about where we are today and I'll actually go back even further, Ardemisinin about nine months ago and we even say it differently, Ardemisinin's cost target is about $3,000 a barrel of oil cost equivalent. Now I don't know about you, I mean I'm not happy with the fact we are at $134 today, so we went up about $4 today, $4.67 since a barrel I think. So a pretty big increase in price of oil today, yet it's still far off from the $3,000 a barrel cost equivalent that Ardemisinin is actually cost competitive at. In the last nine months we've moved our microbe from a $3,000 a barrel of oil equivalent producer to our best strain today is that about $175 to $200 a barrel. So that kind of gives you a sense of the magnitude of change and what we're constantly doing to get the cost. It's really in those two areas, low cost manufacturing process and ensure we get as much efficiency in that process as possible and then highest efficiency strain to get the most conversion of the sugars from the fermentation process to product. So if once it's in the chamber it burns similarly to the stuff we all know and love, is there another way to think about cleanliness here that would make me feel better? Yeah, completely. I hope you feel better about it. And for those of you who have not seen the the Brazilian manufacturing cycle of turning sugar cane to products, I mean you have to experience that it is the most sustainable and renewable process. I mean I've experienced everything from the water to the electricity is from a renewable source and it's amazing. Not only are they producing power for themselves, they're now the generation, the power generation to the grid in Brazil. For all the right reasons, the Brazilian government fought back putting a new dam coming out of the Amazon and they found a way to be self-sufficient. So instead of the dam to produce power, they're actually burning the bagasse which is the waste of the cane for making ethanol and sugar and they're turning that bagasse into electricity. So that's one big element of the contribution to CO2 from the ground to the will well is actually making sure that the production process is completely renewable. Including the fertilizer, there is not a petroleum-based fertilizer that goes into the cane. They use waste from the process to re-fertilize the fields. So that is what gets you 80% cycle reduction in CO2 on the low end. Our jet fuel is more like 90 and if you put our diesel in the tractors and in the trucks and the ships that transport the product for the jet fuel, you could be as high as 110% improvement. So this is really about life cycle reduction as opposed to reduction in the combustion at the end of the supply chain. That's fascinating. How did you get to be interested in this and what convinced you to leave what I'm assuming was a very cushy job at BP. They have a lot of money there, don't they? That's exactly right, Michael. It's funny. When I was at BP, people always ask me, I had a different background. The most folks at BP said they always asked me, John, what was it like being in startups? I used to explain to them the big differences in startups. I spend most of my time begging for money inside of BP. You don't have to beg for money. It's actually interesting. But there's actually an interesting way to relate to it because the folks that have grew up inside BP, they used to complain that BP asked for extensive business cases to allocate capital. I thought, compared to trying to convince the VC to give you capital, doing a business case inside of a big corporation like BP is actually pretty easy. Convincing them to allocate capital isn't that hard. To me, that's kind of the big difference is, I don't have to beg for capital inside. I didn't have to beg for capital inside of BP. What attracted me to the BP was, John Brown had a lot of influence on my thinking about the environment. And John had a very simple perspective on this. John's view was, you know, we could debate climate change all day long. And the reality is, from his perspective, it's not like there's a completely underpinned case for climate change. And the facts aren't all clear. However, this was one argument he wouldn't want to be on the wrong side of. And, you know, for me, that had a big impact. It's kind of like, so if you really, if you think there's a shot that climate change is for real, why wouldn't you want to do your part to make a difference? And that, to me, was, you know, as simplistic as it sounds the most compelling argument. It's really easy. And today, you know, my kids, you know, it's amazing how my 10-year-old is more focused on doing the right thing than I know I've ever been, right? So, you think about that and you say, there is something happening here. And I don't want to be on the wrong side of it. And this became kind of an interesting opportunity to make a difference. Even though the difference initially, when I left BP, I did not know whether or not there was a fuels business here or whether or not it was a fuels business that was worth chasing. It wasn't even part of it. It really, it really comes down to three things that drove me to join Amrice. One was the founders and the people at Amrice. It really blew me away where I could walk through a company and to an employee. There wasn't one person who didn't have a common purpose for being in that building. And that is completely unlike anything I experienced at BP. You know, at BP, there was a category or a segment of people inside BP that were there because they were on the edge of 50. And that's kind of the worst environment you can work in. So, they have a company where everybody in that company had a purpose and it was a common purpose. I found very, very compelling. I think the second thing was the founders and the investors. It was a fantastic set of investors and the founders convinced me that they were ridden for the right reasons. They didn't even think about an IPO. They didn't even think about valuation. I mean, their whole focus was we're here to do great science and we can make a difference with it. And that was extremely compelling. And the third thing was I was very motivated or excited about the technology. I mean, I'm a technologist at heart, even though I'm not a scientist or a chemist. However, technology and the opportunity to really change the world through technology has always been a key driver for things I've done in life. And this was definitely in a sweet spot. Now, do you experience or did the company experience any tension between the deep DNA of pure science in the company and the founders mentality? And I suspect a lot of other people besides the founders and the need to develop commercial products and to go to market, so to speak. Yeah, if I sit to any of you today that that was a minor issue in our company, you know, you should call me out. It is a point of tension. And I would consider it positive tension, even though not every day does a feel like positive tension. Some days you think, you know, don't these guys get it? And I'm sure they think, what an idiot. He's tried to get production out of us. Doesn't he know it's just about great science? And, you know, I'm trying to paint extremes. I'm sure it's not quite like that all the time. But it is a, it's a very difficult transition to bring it to you together. Something as simple as cycle time. You would think, well, of course, cycle time and a focus on zero defects is important. For many reasons, including making life easy, right? I mean, if you're always killing yourself and not getting much out of it, why would you do it? However, the minute you start capturing metrics, even talking metrics, it becomes, it becomes really difficult, right? It's almost like you're telling them they're going to let the line and lose inside the lab. It's so these kind of what seem like minor issues are actually significant cultural clashes that occur between a commercial mindset and I'll call it a research mindset. And I suspect the tension between permitting failure and experimentation, but getting a level of innovation you want is also a tension that you experience inside the company. Yeah, Michael, I would say that it is and it's a constant exploration. I mean, I have this debate all the time. You always, you know, so if you're in the lab doing experiments, what you want is space. This history has taught me that actually I'm not sure that it's space that drives most innovation and knowing that balance kind of, you know, how do you set milestones that put just enough tension in the process or how do you, how do you restrict just enough resource so that you are working in a resource constrained environment and getting the most innovation? Because I'm not sure that a resource rich environment gets the most innovation. So that not only is it a tension culturally, it's actually, you know, a continuous issue to try to solve. I'm constantly playing with what is the exact aim of a milestone? How much resource do you give it exactly? How much, I mean, I'm currently working with a concept of, you know, why not have people who actually, whose purposes, to just have mine share? All they do is they kind of have space to think and do nothing else and have people then who actually are very focused on production. You want their hands designing the next code of DNA and RNA, placing it inside that microbe and making it work. So it's a, it's a constant tension and I'd say a learning process. So you clearly relish this process and this tension personally otherwise I think you probably would have turned down the job. So where did this come from in you? Why are you this way? I just naturally love learning and discovery. So for me, I don't, as much as some days, I do feel completely frustrated and burnt out in dealing with a fight. The those some days are well, well overcome with the days of excitement where you push the edge. You learn something new and everybody has the big aha and they start doing something better. I mean, I think of, you know, the role of leadership as creating an environment where the people around you are much better because of the environment you created and they would be otherwise. So I thrive on that and it's, you know, I remember in a way, I think of it as driven by my adaptive nature. I immigrated to the US in 73. I came from a very small place, the Azores Islands and the middle of the Atlantic and in the Azores Islands when I left there, I mean, my, my dad was a farmer. I remember us having horses and ox carts. I remember milking a goat in the morning before going to school as the way you're brought up. So you go from that and you're throwing into, you know, my first approach in the US was Logan Airport and the tunnel and you think, you know, you go from a horse to the tunnel and your whole world is completely turned upside down. So you have a choice. You can either reject it and find a way to try to go back to what you know or you adapt and I think the adaptive nature and the desire to constantly learn helps a lot in environments where you really have no answers. You must have a lot of focus on bringing the right types of people into the company with the capital that you've raised, the growth plans that you have. How do you identify the right kind of talent and how hard is that right now in the life of the company? Yeah, I think, you know, second to raising money. It's probably one of my core roles in the company and it's interesting. I focus on one objective in identifying the right people and it's all about culture and I focus on trying to understand who they are as individuals. If somebody isn't adaptive, isn't a great collaborator, doesn't have a learning mindset. Frankly, you know, I just don't think they have a place in our company. So for me, that's the, and you know, because I make the assumption that most people that we interview are really smart. So, you know, being really smart isn't an advantage. The advantage is can you take those smarts and do something really great with those smarts in a team environment? And if you can do that, again, great. Your other question is so, you know, how easy or hard is it to find people like this? You know, I've been scared and then pleasantly surprised, right? So along the way, every time we've seen the plan for headcount growth, I mean, we have a very simple model that says, based on our history of developing the microbe, we know that it takes X number of people to do X number of experiments over X number of time to get X level of yield improvement, which gets to your cost. Pretty simple. And obviously, we're always trying to make it more efficient, right? How do we get more of what we have so that it doesn't take as many turns? So we've got a model then for headcount growth that tracks to that model that then gets to our cost target by the middle of 2009. When I first looked at the headcount growth, I thought, there's just there's no way we're going to do it. You know, it was like at the beginning or at the end of last year, we had targeted, you know, in the first quarter of this year or the first half of this year, we were going to grow the company by 70 people or 80 people. And I thought, you just can't do that. We're not going to be able to find all those people. And this is by the way, December going into January, and we hadn't found any of them. So I'm thinking, you know, there's just no way. And so I was funny. I had a December board meeting. I decided to tell the board that, you know, that we're going to hire in a range. And I gave them a pretty big range. You just ensure that, you know, we could deliver on the low end because I thought there's no way we're going to get there and sure enough, we're... I think the VCs called this sandbag. Sandbag, yeah. I never sandbag. It's really just trot broadening the target. Right, broadening the target. No question. But, you know, we've done it. And we've done it because I think a key factor of our ability to attract people is actually having an exciting project to work on. There's no question that the malaria project has, you know, paid back a million fold already. Just in the quality of people and the energy it creates inside of our company. So I'm just excited about getting to the point of saving lives because you add that with the kind of people who are attracting. And, you know, anybody that asks me, you know, why would you give it away? The question I have is why wouldn't you? Just the right thing to do. Let's hear a little bit from the students and other guests. What questions do you guys have for John? And I'll ask you when you ask your question, please speak loudly so that everybody can hear. And also, if you wouldn't mind, just say your name and what program you're from. Yes? Yeah. I'm Tafish. I'm from the Financial Mathematics Program. So I just wanted to know you mentioned body of background being slightly different from what you're doing right now. So what was your undergrad? I'm sort of a strange case and that I dropped out. I wanted to be an electrical engineer. So I was pursuing an EE and well on my way and then I decided, you know, I like building oscilloscopes at a time when the world needed a different application for oscilloscopes, which was using oscilloscopes to diagnose computers on cars or in cars specifically. And so I left school to go build oscilloscopes and then turn that into a career and then from that did other things. So I really started as a guy who loved transistors and liked to build circuits and like to turn those circuits into funny lines on a screen and then from there kind of evolved into business and other parts of life. So how did you get into a field like a fire technology or molecules which is so chemistry intensive? I mean since you didn't have any expertise in that area. So why would you not go for a field that was closer to what you had and had a background then or you know something that was more relevant to the soil? You know, it's a great question. I have to tell you, I only think about that when I find the days where I'm getting lost in all the verbiage. And I say that because I can tell you throughout my career, it wasn't, it's never been linear. It's never been, you know, based on my studies and my experiences, here are the jobs I'm aiming for. It's actually been much more about here are the things I'd love to do. And in it's funny, the other thing I want to be realistic about early on, I don't think I had much choice. Reality is I probably did but my confidence level was such that I didn't think of it as much choice. I thought of it as you know, interesting opportunity came around. It looked like interesting work and I did it. And the more I did that and started to accumulate sort of a portfolio of different experiences, the more I started to develop this view of the things I like to do. And they weren't jobs, they were attributes. I like to work with people, I like to inspire groups. So I started to develop what it was that I like to do and then you know, I became pretty selective in ending up in the places I like to be. I mean, I'll give you a perfect example. When I went into the oil industry, I had had quite an extensive experience in the automotive vertical. So I was recruited to amical oil to turn around an automotive business they had. You know, it was interesting. When I was recruited, the president of the oil company said to me, you know, you should feel good about coming to workforce. We'll take care of you. I'm like, what do you mean you'll take care of me? What do you, oh yeah, yeah, you know, we've got a pension and there's five years of investing and I was all completely foreign to me. The last thing I wanted to do was have any big corporation take care of me. It just wasn't wire that way. Right? So then I get in six months after being there, BP merges with Amico. And at that point, I think this is good. I guess, I mean, we had my wife and I, we bought a house in Illinois. We were moving from the Bay Area at Illinois and we literally had been in the house for two weeks when the merger got announced and I had no idea. Hit me out of left field, right? So my wife and I kind of said, so what do we do? We finish the house and sell it or when what do we do? And you know, I never imagined myself going from leading an automotive business inside of a big oil company to leading the rebranding of BP. Now, if I have fixated myself on all I do is this kind of thing. I can guarantee you I never would have ended up in rebranding the company. Right? So it's, it's, I don't know, it just kind of happens. That's a good question. Great answer. Yes, right here. To the day we die. And that's the reaction. It's a nice thing. It's a great observation. I have to say, I mean, I can relate to that. And I have to say that it was knocked out of me at a period. I remember when I was in the valley, it was like, you know, two, three years and I would do something else, a different startup, a different, and it was kind of evolving technologies, right? I liked new technologies that were trying to break into established industries. And I did two or three of those. And then somebody looked at me at one point and said, you know, you ought to, you ought to think about staying in one place for a longer time. Which in a way, again, I did at BP, but by accident, it wasn't like I intended to go to BP and stay there for a long time. But it's interesting how people will sometimes try to knock out of you who you are. And you just have to, you have to stay true to yourself. How about on this side? Any questions? Okay, we'll come back to the middle. Yeah. Let me talk to you. I'm the Kent Coenian Department. You sort of alluded to this. I just wanted to confirm that your energy density is going to be the same as the jet fuel that you're making, the energy density with your addition is the same as it is for just 100%. Just let me better than JETA. About 1% improvement of a JETA. And I think of 1% is kind of, you know, non-material. I can tell you the airplanes or the airline companies think of 1% is very material. And because that's what they're looking for, right? They've got a weight density ratio that's really important for their profitability. So theoretically, we might get our snacks back. Good luck. That's actually just the bot would have pays for. Oh, this side's lighting up, yes. Great question, Celia. I, in my last BP job, I ended up working on the transformation of the U.S. marketplace for selling fuels. And in doing that, I became very close to several very large customers of which Walmart was one of them. I became the fastest category to create a billion dollar business within Walmart in the history of Walmart. So I was pretty excited about doing that with fuels. And I can tell you that it won't take a lot to convince Walmart to take on a good product. And, you know, and it's partially because Walmart wants to do the right thing. And secondly, because of economics, think about this for a second. The last part of the supply chain, which is really what Walmart is very good at, getting every dime out of supply chain they can, one of their last parts to really optimize is fuel. They are the second largest consumer of diesel in the world, second only to the U.S. government. They consume just slightly less diesel than Brazil does as a country. As a company. So, then think about this, there is a one dollar tax credit today for renewable diesel. If you do the math and if I just share a piece of that with Walmart, it could represent, you know, five to six hundred million dollars of profit improvement to Walmart. You combine that with doing the right thing for the environment. And, you know, the old, I guess the new saying green is green. There's no question that they start to see it that way. And that's how we've looked at our whole route to market. We looked at our route to market as diesel in the U.S. is five customers. Five customers represent about 30% of the market. And it's developing unique relationships with those five customers and selling to them directly. Rather than trying to convince oil companies to take your product so they didn't can take all your profit margin. Yes, here. So, how do you differentiate yourself from conventional biotech companies which are things in pharmaceuticals? And they also have a very high cost of development. So, does the biotech industry look at you as a solution? I don't know. I see ourselves very different. And it's kind of interesting. It's definitely become one of the themes internally around culture. If you think about some of our early hires from industry, they were out of the biotech industry. And there's just a very different mindset. When you're developing a product that takes 10 years to get to market, I guarantee you you're wired differently. Right? And so, it's actually very different and it's a bit of an issue. It's something I'm in heavy exploration right now. I don't think there is a performance management culture. In other words, metrics to drive high efficiency, to drive high throughput in a bio-farma industry. It may be evolving. I just don't see it as very mature. And I'm looking for how do you put that in place in a research environment. So, I don't think they're very alike, even though people looking from the outside kind of see them in the same area. Right? It's biology and chemistry. It must all be biotech and it all kind of works together. It's actually quite different. How about over here? Yes? 55 to 60 is theoretical max, which is about 90 percent of the theoretical max of the yeast strains that we're working with. And 90 percent gets you to 55 to 60 and we will be there around middle of 09. And you might say, well, you know, 55 to 60, what's the meaning of that? You know, the world's changing very fast. If you were to ask me a year ago, I would tell you 55 to 60 is about the break-even point for producing a barrel out of the newest large fields in the world. So, it's a pretty important target to have because it then makes you sustainable. Even though there might be periods of time where, you know, the industry goes below that for them to really sustain themselves and have investment go back into the industry. You've got to stay above that with return of capital included. That number, specifically driven by a lot of inflation and steel and labor, is now really more like 80, 85, right? So, it's really hard to fix or believe that number is fixed at any point in time. It'll vary, but that's the logic. And we sort of have to look at the number. I, what it takes to replace current reserves with our strains and theoretical max for the strain performance. Hopefully, they're close, but there's no, you know, it's more luck than it is science to get them close because you don't determine the theoretical max of thermodynamics inside of a cell. Yes. Hi, I'm Brian. I'm from the Civil Engineering Department. And I was wondering about Amorous's long-term or exit strategy. Yeah, you and many investors. You know, I mean, here's the way I like to explain it. You know, IPO is obviously one of the exits that we consider. And I think of exit, and let me say it differently. It was one of the ways we think to bring liquidity to our investors. Because at the end of the day, I mean, I think our management team and our people want to build a sustainable company for their future and the future of the world, not just get out of it. So for our investors, liquidity, we think a key event would be an IPO. And our timing of that is, you know, we, as a company, will have hit the milestones we think we need to hit to do a successful IPO sometime around the beginning of 2009. Whether we do it then or not is dependent on the market and many other factors, but that's what we see as our timing. Yeah. I'll add you from the business school. My question is around supply constraints in order to scale your business. What constraints do you have that, you know, that pushes your limit on how big it can scale your business? Where do you get all this yeast? Yeah, it's scale. The yeast is the easy part. The cane juice is the harder part. So the constraint, it's all about scale. It's, you know, how fast can you get to how many gallons? You know, people sometimes ask me about customers and it's like, look, you look out and this is a, you know, trillion gallon market, the transportation fuels market. Trillion gallons at today's prices is a four trillion dollar business. I'm not too worried about customers. I am very worried about materially scaling, building enough, fast enough to actually have any meaning in the world. I mean, you look at the industry today and it's, you know, three and a half, four percent of the U.S. demand, right? So it's, and that's ethanol, not even a diesel product. Diesel products are not, you know, they don't even show up on the radar when you look at their total penetration of the world, diesel market. So the real constraint is scale and it's feed stock scale. We, we focused on feed stock is the stuff you feed the yeast. It's the stuff you feed the yeast, exactly. So we feed the yeast cane juice. Why do we pick cane juice? Because I think of cane juice and I'm not very picky. I don't really care which feed stock as long as it's lowest cost and it's lowest cost in total. It's lowest cost in environmental, lowest cost in total impact in the world and lowest cost and its ability to capture and then extract carbon from the sun. That's, that's in me is the sweet spot and you're always looking for what is that feed stock. Today that feed stock is sugar cane. Will it be something else in the future? I don't know. I hope so. I mean, I hope that some of the cellulosic technologies emerge and can take a waste by products into scalable models for fuel. If they do, we'll take the sugars that they can make from that waste and we'll make products out of them. But right now it's cane and it's growing enough cane. It takes about three years of lead time to build or put the plant cane and then be able to grow that cane enough to make fuel. Here's the good news. In Brazil today, there is a potential about 95 to 100 billion gallons of production without affecting forest, what I'll call coastal forest, rainforest, or soy land, which is a pretty big need today that Brazil produces for the world. So I look at that and say, lots of scale there, but that's the bottleneck. Can we make it, can we grow it fast enough to make enough production to make a meaningful impact? Let's have one more question then we'll sum up, yes. I'm curious if Amaress is looking or has the trajectory focused solely on myofuse or is it still looking to maybe address or to come up with products that will address human health issues as well? That is a great question. I mean, that is one debate we have. My personal mission is to only do pharma if it's consistent with our model for antimilarial, which is that we can be an ingredient into a current drug that significantly reduces the cost and provides access to those who need it. That's my only mission and I think there are a couple of potential targets that the Gates Foundation has been exploring with us. So if we find that we can microbially produce an ingredient for a much lower cost than current ingredients in some of the world's biggest killers and reduce costs therefore provide access to the people who need it, we'll do that. Great question. A couple of things struck me through the conversation. One is what you said about people and I've observed a lot of this in the students I've worked with here and in the community in general here this idea of an adaptive high-powered brain that likes to work in teams and those three things are really I think a common thread through a lot of the ETL guests we've heard from this year and it's also nice to see that the practical application of that adaptive high-powered brain that likes working in teams is this you do get frustrated and there are times when you have a bad day but what the outcome from the adaptive high-powered brain that likes to work in teams is you bounce back real quick and you come back and the mission excites you and the team re-excites you and that every day blips and bobs in the happiness meter don't get you down permanently. I like that a lot. I also like the theme of turning non-renewable energy resources into renewable cleaner resources that actually leverage existing infrastructure. That's a combination of that's a strategic combination of variables that is new to me at least as I thought about folks trying to tackle the fuel energy problems we all face so I think that's a particularly noteworthy point. The last thing I'd say is I read a book last year or last quarter teaching with Bob Sutton in MSNE 282 on what makes novel ideas stick or why do innovations happen and some of the best innovations that have most lasting impact on markets and the lives of everyday people is when a relatively old idea is repurposed in a new way and I just got that in spades from what you talked about. I mean to your point we've been fermenting we've been making beer and wine using yeast to help us have a party for a long time and the fundamental concepts of feeding the yeast something and then having it metabolize and spit something out the back end. That's an old idea but this is a whole new way to think about it and it's really fascinating. I would just love in the last 30 to 60 seconds if you would give a piece of advice to these folks in the audience and tell them something maybe somebody told you that you found particularly useful or something you wish you had known when you were in their shoes and you'll have the last word. Geez I would say this will sound kind of hokey but I'll start by an example and then give you my sum. The example is you know throughout my career interesting opportunities always presented themselves and I was a bit in patient and I typically jumped on the earlier opportunity and looking back I mean it's been all right but I can tell you that my my lesson through time and I learned this a lot more in the last 10 years of my career than my first 10 years of my career it's just be patient it's interesting there's always the right thing out there for you don't jump on the first thing don't jump on the first idea be patient and it's amazing the you know the opportunities that will come your way that's the best thing I could give you is be patient and things will be just fine and to sum it is you know don't stop pursuing your dream I mean it is I never never dreamt of having the opportunities that this country has presented to me and the environment that it makes it available as an immigrant leaving the azoirs I mean I had no idea what I was going to do with my life and looking back I think you know what a dream life so don't stop dreaming and you know be patient life will be just fine well put thank you very much
