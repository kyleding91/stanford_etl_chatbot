 Who you are defines how you build. This is the Auditorial Thought Leader's series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. What's the point of entrepreneurship education? I'm Chuck Easley, Associate Professor in Stanford Department of Management Science and Engineering, and in this episode we're going to explore that fundamental question. It's an important question, not just for universities, but also for local and national government. Education and training in entrepreneurship is often promoted as a force that can create jobs, spur much needed technological innovation, and even reshape the global geopolitical balance. Yet in a recent research paper I wrote with Young Sook Lee at Stanford's Freeman Spoky Institute for International Studies, we found something that might seem counterintuitive. Looking at data from Stanford alumni, including those who participated in programs run by the Stanford Technology Ventures program and the Center for Entrepreneurial Studies in Stanford's Graduate School of Business, we found that entrepreneurship education seemed to have zero impact on startup formation rates among alumni of those programs. We'll include a link to that paper in the show notes on E Corner. So if entrepreneurship education doesn't necessarily create more startups, why do it? We did find some evidence that entrepreneurship education results in a higher quality pool of founders. Those who do start companies tend to get started sooner after graduating, have a lower rate of failure, connect more with fellow alumni, and create larger firms with more revenue. In any case at STVP we believe that entrepreneurship and innovation is about much more than founding a company. We believe that an entrepreneurial mindset can inspire individuals to do innovative work in large companies, governments, non-profits, academia, and even activism in the arts. But I was curious how others in the field of entrepreneurship education would react to our findings. Were they aiming to create more startups? Or did they have a different North Star? And what educational approaches did they find to be most effective? Whatever their goals might be? I started out by connecting with John Feld to Duke, my own undergraduate alma mater. John is a philosopher, turned entrepreneur, turned educator, who runs Duke's Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiative, which exposes hundreds of Duke undergraduate and graduate students to training and entrepreneurship and innovation every year. I figured he would have a particularly thoughtful take on this vital question. So in terms of the study, what we found, at least in the Stanford Alumni Data Set, was that entrepreneurship education on the whole didn't seem to increase raw startup creation rates. But did help founders get started more quickly and perhaps most importantly help them to gauge their ability or fit with entrepreneurship. Do these findings surprise you? And either way, how would you articulate the goals of entrepreneurship education from your perspective? Number one, to your first question, the results do not surprise me. In fact, I would say that should be by design. Because the goal of a, I don't think the goal of an entrepreneurship education process or program is to make people start companies. It is to equip them to be good at it if they choose to start a company. And that involves critically evaluating both the opportunity they're looking at, the need they're serving, their own capabilities, what's required to be successful. So in a sense, it raises the threshold for entry because it makes students more aware of what's involved and more critical. Even if you decide to embark on an academic career or you're going to go work for a large corporation, the skill set, the orientation to action, the critical abilities that we teach, we think are relevant everywhere. And that is also by design. So we don't emphasize you have to go start a company as the goal. But we say the practice of thinking through starting a company, creating the innovation, evaluating it, which the best educational context for which is a startup is a skill that you can then apply anywhere. When I ran the experiential entrepreneurship education program, we called brilliantly called the program for entrepreneurs, which was a two year sequence culminating in a startup if successful. In the, we had a kickoff event in the summer before students came and I said, this is the lowest cost opportunity to fail that you will ever have. And that's a golden opportunity. The idea of embarking on a venture and then seeing why it didn't work out is a very, very useful learning. So we didn't measure success by how many startups did we create? We measured success by how many well equipped students graduated and went on to more successful careers. And in some cases eventually started companies. John's perspective at Duke seems to parallel our own approach at the Stanford Technology Ventures program, presenting entrepreneurship education as a useful path to starting a venture, but a path to many other careers as well. After speaking with John, I connected with Hadea Mujee. Like John, I found her to be particularly insightful when it comes to talking about how we train future entrepreneurs and innovators. I'm Hadea Mujee. I'm the CEO and founder of HBCU VC, where we are focused on increasing racial diversity and equity in venture capital. I was interested in speaking to Hadea both because HBCU VCs programs are particularly focused on students of historically black colleges and universities. And because she's immersed in the venture capital side of the startup ecosystem, how did those contextual differences I wondered impact how her program thinks about training future innovators. Can you talk a bit about the approach to training and supporting entrepreneurs in your network and what mechanisms you've seen that seem to be most effective in the context of HBCU universities that you work in? Yeah, one of the things that we truly anchor on is what we call culturally affirming curriculum. Right, you know, out of necessity, a lot of black and brown people are entrepreneurs, but we don't necessarily call it that and we haven't labeled it that, right. And it took me a long time to understand that I came from a family of entrepreneurs. My mother, my mother and my grandmother moved over here from Jamaica and out of necessity had to set up businesses to take care of us. And growing up, I never saw this as entrepreneurship. It was work. It was what they did so that we could put food on a table. But somehow this aspect of my grandmother who gathered a community for friends and her family to go clean office buildings at night. She had employees. But I viewed that as work and there was this element of entrepreneurship that seemed glamorized. It's important to one is still belief and confidence that this thing that we're glamorizing is already in our community, but we may have different needs, we may have different terms and it may look different. And so when we talk about culturally affirming curriculum, we focus on some of the skill sets that may be already existing in actually many and we're able to connect those dots. Our research found some evidence that the social networking aspects of entrepreneurship programs may play a significant role in addition to formal training and programming. So I asked Hidia to talk about how network effects might play a role in HBCU VCs programs. We anchor a lot on the social network impacts. It's one of the reasons why we're cohort based. When you're able to anchor and root yourself in some type of community, there's like this weird connected glue or fiber. I think the social network or the network based component of entrepreneurship is not only key for learning from each other, but also there's a mode of encouragement that happens, a mode of confidence that happens, which I think is extremely important because I've seen people who have started the path of entrepreneurship on their own by themselves. And they only do it once and then they shut down in the next day and they're like, oh, I tried that, it didn't work out. Hidia's emphasis on cohort based approaches certainly syncs up with what we saw in our research. In the context of STVP, participation in our 12 person immersive Mayfield Fellows program was associated with the most significant entrepreneurial outcomes. Many entrepreneurship education programs are now asking themselves how they can do a better job of empowering black entrepreneurs and other entrepreneurs from underrepresented groups. So I ended by asking Hidia if she had any advice for how we can do a better job of embracing potential entrepreneurs from the black community. I think it starts with this concept of unlearning and going through and unpacking how you're teaching entrepreneurship and making sure that it is culturally relevant. In the prime example of this is how certain VCs may have a bias against co-founder relationships, co-founder sort of date and co-founder sort of married. And when they see that, they see that as a red flag and stuff away and with good intention of, hey, if something goes back here in the romantic relationship, then the company goes down with it and my money is at risk. But then if you add this other lens, I forget which study it was, but close to 50% of all women entrepreneurs actually are in a relationship with their co-founder. That's a huge percentage, right? And if you take this concept of, I'm not funding partners who are in a romantic relationship, you're changing the funding lens for women entrepreneurs in next detriment. And so if I'm looking to create a diverse ecosystem, inclusive ecosystem, how do I keep checking for those blinders across different identities that I do not have? I think that there is a continuous work of unpacking curriculum to make sure that it's inclusive. Hadea brings up a great point. As we're asking whether entrepreneurship education is effective, there's an added layer. We need to be asking who it's effective for, and also who's being left out of the conversation, and sometimes the classroom itself. Stanford Duke and HVCU VC programs we've been talking about work mostly with current university students who haven't necessarily started to chart their career paths. But what about a program where individuals self-select towards actively pursuing a career in startup ventures? With that question in mind, I spoke with Elizabeth Break, the COO of Venture for America. Venture for America currently operates in 13 cities, connecting recent college graduates with startup jobs and entrepreneurship training, and preparing them to lead organizations and create jobs in the communities where they work. I was curious to learn how their emphasis on a post-collegiate population impacts their programming, particularly given that startup creation does seem to be one of their core goals. We are a to your fellowship program for aspiring entrepreneurs who are recent college graduates. We're looking for people who have the skills and the interest and the ability to operate in a startup environment which we recognize is unpredictable, often ambiguous. Very often very unstructured, and we provide them that training and connect them to jobs with startups in cities across the US. What we're doing is having them have an apprenticeship-like experience in these startups where they're working for founders who are already doing the work and being in a startup and seeing what it's really like. While we are on the side giving them programming to think like an entrepreneur, to test out ideas, to build teams, to see how it works. And then ultimately for our alumni, we also have an accelerator and a seed fund. And so we're helping you learn to think like an entrepreneur to have the experience of training with an entrepreneur. And then when you're ready to do it yourself, we have resources to help you do that. So one of the central findings in our papers that at least in the context of these Stanford Entrepreneurship Education programs, they didn't necessarily increase the startup formation rate. Although they did seem to help founders to raise capital and to scale their ventures more quickly to get started sooner after graduating. So we suspect that there's some filtering process going on here where a student study entrepreneurship, some decide that entrepreneurship just isn't right for them and self-selected different path. So one implication is that educators might think about adjusting how they teach entrepreneurship depending on the context and the goals. Can you talk a little bit more about how you articulate the goals for venture for America and how that affects the programming? We were founded on the intuition that academic training is important and helpful, but it is alone not sufficient that real life experience is necessary. If you want to become a doctor, it's not easy. But there are people who can tell you how to do it. There is a path you study for the MCAT. This is how you apply to school. Those things are discoverable, even if they're not simple or easy. It's not really discoverable how a college senior becomes an entrepreneur. There's no set of applications, there's no one who can tell you take steps, A through F, and then you can be an entrepreneur. And so we really wanted to light that path and say here is one way that you can get experience, that you can learn what it means, you can see people making decisions on a day-to-day basis. How much do you ultimately care that they start their own ventures versus finding some other way to use the entrepreneurial mindset to make an impact? We care. Our mission is to mobilize entrepreneurs. And so we do want people to become entrepreneurs. We also recognize that there are some people who would rather be startup leaders in someone else's startup. And that also our fellows are still quite young. And that even though we have really increased the rate of startup activity compared to their peers, there are still people in their early to late 20s with relatively few resources, even with the resources we can provide. And I think that we will see a longer tail impact as they become older, as they have more resources, as they have more experience. So we want them to become entrepreneurs or startup leaders. We would really like them to stay in our VFA cities so they don't always. But I think that certainly the impact is well beyond that. It's the entrepreneurial mindset that they bring to their civic activities, to their volunteer activities, to the other things that they care about and the work that they do in their city. And we just completed on that point a qualitative impact assessment about what does it mean to be connectors in the community who are connecting perhaps siloed institutions or connecting one VFA city to another VFA city. Our rate compared to not only the rates of entrepreneurship out there in the world, but the rates of entrepreneurship among people who applied to venture for America and did not get in. So a fairly similar group of people, especially people who became families and didn't get in. We're seeing that VFA fellows are having entrepreneurial activity, their starting businesses are doing side projects, they're identifying professionally as a founder of a business at a rate that's five times higher than that near people. And that near peer comparison group. If data like Elizabeth's can be validated in other contexts, it could demonstrate that at least in some non-university settings, increasing startup formation rates might be both possible and desirable. And even for programs that primarily aim to drive startup creation, there might be other fringe benefits. Another research project, my co-authors and I are examining data from the startup Chile accelerator and exploring how the program impacted career outcomes beyond entrepreneurship. Speaking of research, to wrap things up, I asked Elizabeth what sort of future research into entrepreneurship education might help her make important decisions in her own organization. We'd be interested in the difference between access to education and access to resources. Is it about education? Education without access to resources may not matter much. Access to resources without the education, can you make the best use of those resources? How do we pair those to the access to the resources and the access to the entrepreneurial education to convent them to really sets young people up to be successful impactful entrepreneurs? I think that like the FAA believes that we need both, but I sometimes I feel like we have only the ability to do so much. We have to pick, do we dial up the resources, do we dial up the education, what do we do, and how do we make sure we pair them together well? I think there's something about those relationships and I'd be really interested in someone who could tell me more about how those two things work together. Broadly speaking, formal entrepreneurship education in American universities really began to take off in the late 1990s. In the last few decades, the field has grown immensely, but it's still young discipline and there are many opportunities for researchers to equip educators with data about how and why entrepreneurship education works. This kind of research could turn out to be useful not just in the US but around the world. In many emerging economies, tech accelerators, incubators, and science parks are tools designed to kickstart entrepreneurship and innovation. And often include training and networking components. The better the data we have on how context affects the goals and outcomes of entrepreneurship education and training, the more communities will be able to adjust their approach to fit their own needs and objectives. That's it for this episode. In case you'd like to dig into the paper that inspired this conversation, we'll include the link in the show notes on e-corder. We'd love to hear your thoughts about this research as well. To keep the conversation going, just send a note to stanford-e-corner at stanford.edu and include the word research in your subject line. Stay tuned for future ETL research episodes. We'll be creating more of these conversations as new STVP research comes out. And thanks for listening.
