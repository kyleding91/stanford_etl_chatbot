 You were listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at edcorner.stanford.edu. So without further ado, let's welcome to Penn and Ashwin. Thanks Professor Bars, so it's always good to be back on the farm. So thanks for having Ashwin out here. It's always good to see young students wanting to get an entrepreneurship and figure out the next great companies. So I'm just going to ask Ashwin a couple of questions for 10-20 minutes. But in the meantime, feel free to jump in and at the end we'll have some Q&A as well. So I want to keep this interactive as possible since you guys are all Bitcoin tour users. You probably have a lot of customer complaints or whatever that Ashwin can deal with personally. Now you know who to call. Yeah, I'm going to give you a pink Z-Nell across the other. The first line of defense. So just Ashwin left to hear a little bit about Bitcoin kind of pre-Ashwin. So you know, Bitcoin has been around for several years now, more than five years now. And left to hear about how you saw before you got involved. So what was your co-founder, Bram's vision and how you got it going and how it got to before you joined? Yeah, sure. So Bram is an engineer that was a guy who dropped out of college. He went to SUNY Buffalo and was really intent on getting into the computer science field. So he came out here in the .com Go-Go days. I think it was in the late 90s. And spent a couple of years working at a bunch of different .coms. It was late off in 2001 and got really interested in this idea that websites were increasingly wanting to deliver large amounts of data to an audience online. But the protocol that we were using at that time to deliver large files from websites was HTTP. We've all typed it into an address bar. And that stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. And what Bram saw was that this text transfer protocol was no longer being used for text. It was being used for software downloads, game downloads, and even some amounts of media downloads, like video and audio. And this text transfer protocol wasn't scaling very well to accommodate that kind of a payload for the protocol. So you decided to write a new protocol. You called it BitTorrent, which as the name suggests was enabling a torrent of bits to be delivered from a central location by harnessing all of the collective bandwidth that lives in an audience. So rather than looking at the internet as a broadcast medium, he took observation of the fact that the internet is a two-way medium. And that if people who are receiving data can also be providing it to the people that need it, that you could do a lot less work to reach the same number of people with the same amount of data. And so this was the problem he got very focused on in 2001. By 2003 had a protocol that was working pretty robustly. And that's when I think that most of us that are aware of BitTorrent on a consumer level really probably started to discover it. Because websites across the world were using it to distribute all kinds of cool things. Linux distributions, for example, were kind of the first application that took advantage of BitTorrent mostly because an individual copy of Linux was around three gigabytes in size. And a file of that size in 2002, 2003 at the prevailing bandwidth prices at that time could cost several dollars in bandwidth. And for an object that has no sort of business model for distributing individual copies, there's no way for a provider to really recoup the cost of making the file available. So BitTorrent found its home initially in that community and the open source community where those that weren't charging for an individual copy of an application could very efficiently make this application available to a large number of people. From Linux and the open source realm, BitTorrent also became really popular in different communities around the world. The anime community, anyone here an anime fan, Japanese animation, you can admit it. It's actually not too many surprisingly, but this is a category of entertainment that is in my opinion extremely under distributed. It's a category of entertainment that has this very, very evangelical group of fans. They're distributed around the world, not necessarily Japanese, but that suffer from a lack of distribution of this content. And the anime community was able to leverage BitTorrent to make anime titles available broadly in places where they weren't getting well distributed offline. So it wasn't available in DVD or on TV broadcasts or in movie theaters. So people really in this anime community depended on BitTorrent to find that that genre of entertainment. And of course, we all are aware that BitTorrent was being used by sites that were allowing users to upload TV shows and things that were also in many cases not well distributed outside of the United States. And the BitTorrent audience started to grow as a result of all of this publication activity that was taking place. Fundamentally, Bram solved this problem of being able to allow websites to deliver vast amounts of data with a very small budget. And he designed it to be just the right amount of functionality. So it would be very general in its applicability and very lightweight in its resource utilization so that both users and publishers could get a lot of value out of it. So just kind of a disclaimer. So Bram was the second company we invested where the founder dropped out. The first one was the Facebook. Sock dropped out. Now Bram dropped out. That's not a message that you guys should have dropped out of schools and started companies. But if you do, we're always very interested to meet entrepreneurs. There's something to be said for young entrepreneurs who aren't shackled by traditional ways of thinking. These are all going to try things near. And that's really what Ashtron talked to what BitTorrent did. He didn't follow the path of HTTP and saw new protocols that invented a new protocol that could approach things with a new paradigm. But that's kind of pre-Ashtron. That was when it was a free service, freely distributed. How did you get involved in BitTorrent? Why did you decide, hey, this is a free service. I want to go ahead and join up with Bram. It was a tough call. So Bram had developed BitTorrent as a truly open source project. He had no ambitions to make it a business. He released it right from the get-go under a very flexible open source license. And based on some of the decisions he made, wasn't anticipating that it would ever really be that successful. Of course, by 2003, he knew that he had figured something very valuable out. How many clients did you have back then? It was in the, you know, probably between 10 and 20 million downloads by that point in time. It hit my radar screen when I was at Yahoo 2003, 2004 timeframe. Yahoo, who had, at the time, was run by a new CEO, a guy named by the name of Terry Sommel, who was a movie studio executive, who ran Warner Brothers for a number of years very successfully. And at that time, was, had entast my group, the corporate development group at Yahoo, to figure out if there was a business for Yahoo and digital distribution of content. And we looked at the landscape at that time. You know, iTunes was just about to launch. And there were some other services that were out there, distributing movies and other categories of media. And of course, there was a lot of interesting things happening in software aggregation for applications like download.com or digital river. So there was these different areas where digital distribution was starting to take hold in various categories of content. And so my group kind of looked at this landscape and tried to figure out if Yahoo should be in this business, and you know, whether it should get in through acquisition or through a build scenario. And one of the things that we were interested in figuring out was that Yahoo was also making a big push in the web search. You know, the success that Google was having was pretty clear since Yahoo was an investor in Google and was well aware of the traffic growth that was happening there. There was this real elegant way of aggregating content by just crawling web pages and aggregating links. The problem that an application like download.com was having is that when they would add a new application or software title to the directory, the amount of traffic that download.com, for example, was having, would crush a software developer, a software developer that might develop a utility to unzip a file on your Windows desktop, would suffer from, you know, a website going down just because download.com was sending so much traffic to this developer. So what download.com did in response to that was actually offer hosting services to these garage shop software developers so that they wouldn't go away once they got the popularity. Along comes this protocol, this new web protocol called BitTorrent, that if these software developers were using and some of them were, would have almost infinite scalability and wouldn't have to provision, you know, dedicated servers and server resources to accommodate that demand. And so I got this idea that, well, if, you know, maybe Yahoo should consider using BitTorrent to address the problem of when Yahoo would create demand for these developers that they wouldn't go away, that they could actually thrive and be successful. So that's what led me to get in touch with Bram. We actually had a mutual friend who put us in touch. And then after brainstorming some stuff, I just left Yahoo and decided to start the company, BitTorrent Inc, because I thought that BitTorrent had a real bright future at that time to actually develop commercial applications for the technology. Even though it was open source, the fact that people were using it, the brand was getting to be well known and the communities that were thriving and depending on BitTorrent to exist, were obviously great case studies to build some commercial applications. So before we kind of get into business, I think one of the things that has always been, you know, delicate balance is finding the right, and building the right co-founding team. It's been the success and also the bane of a lot of startups where co-founders either get along great at the Larry and Sergey's story and they build a great company. And then you've got the other examples where they don't get along really well. It falls apart and the chemistry's just not there. How did you kind of parse that and figure out, you know, Bram is a guy I'm going to spend the next number of years, you know, late nights, bad times, good times, it's basically getting married. It's probably what's going to happen. Yeah, I think we dated for a while. Yeah, so it's, you know, how did you know that this was the right fit? And what advice would you give future entrepreneurs here that are, you know, friends or whatever, that maybe think about starting a company? What should they avoid? What are the pitfalls in building that? Yeah, you got to spend some time up front making sure. I mean, students have a great opportunity being on campus to really get to know people well. And the relationships that you're going to build here are going to be valuable for a long time after you leave. And so, you know, and being in this environment, being in Silicon Valley and a long heritage here at Stanford of entrepreneurial behavior, you know, this is a great time to take some risks and make some experiments with the people that you're already spending lots of time with. You know, in the case of me leaving Yahoo, people that I was crazy, you know, I worked for a studio chief who spent most of, you know, had hired many lawyers at Warner Brothers to shut companies down that were trying to commercialize peer-to-peer applications for good reason. I mean, you know, they were file sharing applications. And I think BitTorrent has some very dramatic differences. But, you know, the Yahoo team, I think probably didn't think this was a very wise move on my part at that time for a variety of reasons. Being open source, being peer-to-peer, being used for a lot of, being associated with a lot of piracy. But what I saw in Brown was a guy that, you know, complemented, our skills complemented each other very well. And first, in addition to that, Brown was a guy that could get really obsessed with the problem and get, you know, very focused on it and be eager to solve it and had very strong technical capability. And, you know, matching well with my background being more, you know, being more aligned in the business realm. And I saw the opportunity to, because BitTorrent had this, just this fundamental value that we could actually reposition the technology and actually win approval of big media companies to commercialize successfully and make this thing really successful. And that's what we, that was the initial idea. And finding that Brown was interested in doing that with me, we just got together and did it. Yeah, and it's amazing how you guys have continued to work so close with each other after all these years. I mean, I don't know, you guys haven't had Brown, but these two cannot be more different. But at the same time, the chemistry, it is like an old married couple. And after like 50 years, they kind of know each other's hot buttons and work through that stuff. And having that chemistry is probably one of the most intangible things that we look for when investing companies is that founder, founder capability. But you know, kind of you've been touched on the business a little bit here. But if we dig in a little bit, peer-repeer has been around for, you know, the decade now from the music guys, the Skype, and, you know, in lots of video alternatives. No one's ever actually made a profitable business off it. You know, people have gotten acquired. And some have gotten shut down. But no one's actually ever made money. Kind of what's different now and how does BitTorrent kind of change the game? You guys are in lots of business units. How do you think about this all coming together? You know, I think maybe some of the similarities in the YouTube model, for example, where there's this perceived cloud of, you know, whether it be liability or controversy around the applications for the technology or the service. BitTorrent had to contend with those right from the beginning. And it took, you know, the amount of times you get kicked in the gut for things like that, kicked in the teeth, you start to develop some thick skin. The realization became very clear at the beginning that, you know, I didn't know that we were going to be able to raise venture capital. I didn't know that there would be media companies that would actually work with us. And at times I was wondering if, you know, we were going to get sued and, you know, just because of the perceptions. You know, I knew that fundamentally the technology was strong and it was general purpose and it had tremendous merit on a technical level that would ultimately, just like the internet in 1994, would, you know, see great success in the commercial realm. But there was that initial period of time where, you know, when you've got a news article that just completely misaligns you, just like in 1994 you could find, you know, pretty smart business people dismissing the internet as a fad. You know, that was in many ways the kind of rhetoric around peer to peer, like on tier point and bit torn specifically. So we just sort of hunkered down and just assumed that we had to prove ourselves and start to deliver value before we could really expect any validation or buy in from the investment community or from media companies or our customers. And, you know, just sort of one step at a time, you know, start marching towards the goal. So, so bit torn today has the BitTorner Entertainment Network, which is the video download. It's launched the BitTorn DNA, which is a CDN servers. Love to, you know, take us through kind of how those two business models are going to evolve and how they're interrelated and how do you kind of think about the next steps for both of them. Well, the BitTorner Fundamentally is a delivery. It's a protocol and as a commercial entity, it can be used as a delivery service. And that's what we decided to do is build a service with the BitTorn protocol that businesses can use. And so that's fundamentally what BitTorner does. It's a more efficient way of delivering data than other internet protocols. And that's what we went out in 2000, you know, January 2005 when we kind of got things sort of set up. We went out and started pitching potential customers. What we found is that most of the very technical organizations, even here in the Silicon Valley, were a bit afraid of here. Particularly the business folks and the lawyers definitely for sure. There was some concern about, well, if we use BitTorrent Inc as a vendor, is this company going to be around? You know, are you guys going to get sued? Are we going to get sued as a customer of yours? And your brand has these very polarizing aspects to it. So after a good six months of, you know, some fits and starts, what we decided to do was engage down a path of being a customer of our technology ourselves. And that would, what that means is that we thought we could build a showcase for BitTorrent with media companies buying into it and essentially working with us in this showcase to demonstrate how BitTorrent could really let some amazing things happen. And so what we started at that point in time was what's now called the BitTorrent Entertainment Network, which is a showcase for media companies to come license us their content, or publish their content into an aggregation medium. And then we would deliver whatever it is that they've published with the BitTorrent Delivery System. So the number of companies that we approached and have successfully closed relationships with to do that is now substantial. I think we've got close to 50 media companies that have signed agreements with us to publish their content in that includes companies like Warner Brothers, Paramount, 20th Century Fox, Lionsgate. So basically the largest media companies in the world, and if I had told you three years ago that the largest media companies in the world would embrace BitTorrent, I probably would have been kicked out of this room. What was the change apart? What kind of... Well, what kind of corner? Basically the strategy, what allowed us to do that? Yeah, why do the media companies decide to embrace BitTorrent as a delivery mechanism for their prized content? What we did was we took observation of the way BitTorrent was being used in its open implementations. And it was clear that BitTorrent was increasingly becoming a media distribution tool, sort of just because that's the way the ecosystem developed and that's where the market inefficiencies were. People increasingly wanted to consume entertainment online on their PCs, or in a connected environment, and that provided them a better experience, particularly in a campus environment than having to drive down to Blockbuster, or to have to get a TV in addition to your PC. If everything can be converged in a networked environment on a PC, it's a life-changing experience for a lot of people, it was for me when I was on campus. So the media companies hadn't really been able to fulfill that demand efficiently or effectively at the time that we approached them. There were some experiments, there were some entities like MovieLink, and like I said, iTunes was just kind of getting started, and there was some amount of interest in getting this business model started, of actually distributing media online to an online audience that was increasingly doing the wrong thing, which was downloading this media without the license, illegitimately, and that wasn't benefiting the media companies at all. And of course, Bitcoin was getting to be a popular application to do that, but it wasn't benefiting Bitcoin Inc as well. So we went to the media companies and said, let's work together to give our users a destination for them to start using our application to get your content with your consent and with the business model to make sense. And that was hard. It took a good year to really foster in terms of trust, relationships to foster in terms of trust, and getting the business model. I think we have a lot of room to grow to make that business model better, but we were able to come to some compromises and get some relationships started. Some good anecdote that some of you might find interesting. I was able to really, the BitTorrent brand actually helped in this way, but was able to get some very, very, very senior meetings at some of the largest media companies in the world. And those were some very interesting conversations, because these are not technical people in many cases. And when you come into a meeting having the BitTorrent business card, it ends up creating this very interesting dynamic. So in one situation, I remember sitting kind of across the table from this very senior member of an organization and saying, you know, Mr. Studio Chief, in the next hour that we're going to be talking about 70,000 of your movies are going to be downloaded illegally with my software. We got to do something about that. So that, if I want to show or something else, next time. You can see the eye is kind of pulled out. You know, I think the way we approached it made a lot of sense to him, is that, look, you're not getting any benefit from it. I'm not getting any benefit from it. Let's give these users an opportunity to do the right thing. You know, we can't continue this. There's no sustainable business model in criminalizing our customers. So if we can create a legal environment that gives them what they want, using the tools that they already have on their desktops at a reasonable price, I think we can convert a significant chunk of these people into value creating customers. And, you know, that was the beginning of the relationship, and now we have a substantial number of these relationships. So, and I think, you know, in terms of the number of titles that we've aggregated, you know, with over 10,000 video titles, I think we have a substantial number of titles more than even iTunes and any other digital distribution service that exists. So, you know, from that standpoint, the showcase that is the BitToy Entertainment Network was a business success. We got very wide buy-in from a large number of media companies, and it was a great showcase for what we call BitToyN-A, which stands for Delivery Network Accelerator. And that's a service that any website can implement. How many of you actually have a website, like a blog or a site of your own? And how many of you have ever stuck a Google AdSense ad unit on your website? Get about half of you guys are greedy. We wanted to make it as simple as that to really, to use BitToyN-A for whatever it is that you're trying to distribute. Instead of paying, high-bandwidth costs, right? Yeah, exactly. So, if you, all of you that have websites, if you want to put files on them, and you don't get free bandwidth from Stanford, we'll have to go provision some bandwidth from somewhere. And usually the cost of doing so, if you've got a file that gets very popular is significant. In many cases, if you're students, you're probably not going to have the budget to pay for a very popular download, unless you go convince one of these guys to back you and pay your bills. But... We do more than just pay their bills, but that's a big part of it. We'll talk about that afterwards. So, the... So, Google AdSense, with a little piece of JavaScript, you know, that you could copy and paste from Google, allows you to start making money with your website. And if we can make it as simple as copy-paste some JavaScript from BitTorrent on your website, to make it really easy to distribute files that hopefully you can monetize in some way down the road, we felt could be a really disruptive delivery service relative to the traditional way of, you know, renting you a server or provision you bandwidth and forcing you to commit to a certain amount, which, you know, for particularly for newer businesses, is a very difficult thing to do, because you have no idea how successful you're going to be or what file it is that people are going to find really valuable, and as a new business, or even an established business, even the largest media companies in the world, this can be a money-loosing proposition for quite some time. In fact, online video today, all of the services, you know, whether it be YouTube or any of the products that we now know and love, are all usually money-loosing propositions, because video is such a bandwidth-intensive application that you're just provisioning servers and figuring out how many servers to provision, how much bandwidth provision is usually a big cash sink. But if we can leverage the audience, the bandwidth that lives in the audience, efficiently in a way that allows us to deliver a video to that audience, and have the scalability so that as demand grows, supply also grows, and that's the virtue of a peer-to-peer application, and be able to integrate that with a website very seamlessly, I think we've got a really great product, and that's what we've done. We've launched Bit20 and I spent in the market for about two months, and it's having some great success with our customers. And that's just kind of another part of the business. Professor Byers brought up the whole international, how important that is these days. So BitTorn has gone to overseas much sooner than most typical startups historically in the past. And kind of what drove that decision to go, in this case, as Japan, so much earlier than typical for a startup? There was a lot of... BitTorn itself is not a limited... It's not sort of a U.S. phenomenon. It's a global phenomenon. In fact, it's more popular overseas in certain situations than it is even here, because if you're a fan of a popular TV show, and you're a, say, an English teacher in Japan, or you're a soldier in Iraq, or you're just an expat in anywhere in the world where this particular show isn't getting well distributed, you're probably a diehard at BitTorn user at this point in time. And we've seen BitTorn at the protocol really find dramatic popularity in places in the world like China, where the network, the backbone of the internet, provided by China, Telecom, China Unicom. No, Unicom, mobile, Telecom, Netcom, Netcom, Netcom and Telecom. Have these... what you would think are to be these two networks, North and South, but in fact, they're actually networks in every province, and every province isn't typically very well networked to each other. So what BitTorn was able to do, just by virtue of its applications in China, not by no active our own, but when websites go up in China using BT, the BitTorn protocol, they're actually patching together the Chinese internet in a way that it doesn't currently exist or is in its current design. And in that way, users have been able to get better experiences for downloads in China. For example, when I was there last year, a user told me that a download from sitting in Shanghai was faster from a website hosted in the US than from a website hosted in Beijing, which is an indication that the networks inside China aren't very well peered. But if you've got a website that's using BT, the server could be... even though you're connecting to a website in Beijing, your server, the user, the source of the data you're looking for could be in the house next door to you. And so in that way, it kind of patched together and fixed this very fragment in the internet backbone. In Japan, which is the second largest economy in the world, the network is phenomenal. It's actually probably the best network in the world. It has a network that's been heavily subsidized by NTT, which is the large telco in Japan. And they've got, for the same prices we pay for broadband at our homes, they get 100 megabits of fiber optic capacity that's symmetric. Meaning when we go to Comcast and we get a cable line, we get 6 megabits usually downstream, and maybe 500 to a megabit upstream. In Japan, you actually get the same amount of capacity in both directions, which is what the internet's supposed to be. And this is a great environment for Peer to Peer. Because obviously what we use is the upload capacity of the audience. That's what makes Peer to Peer really go. And it's a really exciting place for us to deploy BitTorrent because a lot of the same trends that we see here, the popularity of video, popularity of online games, and software applications that are getting very popular, whether there will be persistent messaging clients for operating system updates, or all existing in Japan and BitTorrent as a company there, will be offering the BitTorrent DNA service to the Japan marketplace. So I want to make sure you guys have time to ask questions as well. So I'm going to ask one more question and hopefully folks that have a question will raise your hands and we'll get Ash from the junk in. So if you had to look back in the last couple of years and you had to pick one thing that you would do over again, what would that be? There's a few things, but let's see a few things. There's a lot. There's a lot. So bigger ones, I'd say. I'll kind of direct this more to the student audience. The relationships that you develop here are extremely valuable and they're going to last a long time. I said that before and a lot of the things that you learn here outside of the classroom are also going to be very valuable. So those outside classroom activities are going to probably be more valuable to you than with all due respect to the professors than the ones that you actually learned in class. And the reason I say is that when you get into that opportunity where you're onto something great and you're trying to pull together a team that you can work with to take whatever your project is to the next level. You're going to have to go back to those folks that you worked with and that you know and that you trust to really make that successful. And these relationships are going to be great for you down the road. So definitely invest in those. And what I found is that relative to the folks that went to business school, I didn't go to business school. What I envied about them, not a lot I envied about them, but what I did envy about them is that they... Yeah, we're really good golf to you. It'll be good. Maybe now I do, but I have more money than they could. It's been all of them. Cash on tuition. The investment. The relationships. I mean they come out and they've got these phenomenal networks and they're able to draw from them. That's a great thing, whether it's business school or grad school and these environments on educational campuses can be valuable and pay off in many ways. So to that end, higher slow, higher people slow, higher the right people and do your diligence and make sure you get the right people and fire fast. If you've made a mistake, don't get passive aggressive about it. Don't dance around the issues. Make adjustments and be very clear why you're making those kinds of decisions. That's one take away. I think getting good investors is certainly a good thing to do and spending a lot of time with your investors because just like a co-founder you're not getting divorced from your investors ever. So getting to know that these guys really well and it's going to pay off really well. I don't know, maybe it'd be interesting for the folks. How did you, you guys have raised two rounds of funding successfully? Wait, before you go on, there's another thing about getting, realizing where you are in your company's development, your organization's development and doing the right things for that point in time. So there was a book that was written by this guy and I think this is a pseudonym Bob Kringley and I think he keeps a blogger podcast on PBS. He talks about new company developments, a really interesting passage you can probably find in an excerpt on a webpage somewhere. It's about new companies in three stages. Basically in the first stage, what you really want are the commandos. Those that don't obey any rules, they take the beach and they break everything and they do things that are in many ways what most people would consider irrational. And I view that as what Bram did. Bram did some, from a business guy standpoint, pretty irrational things. He invested two years of engineering time and didn't register domains. He didn't set up a company, gave this stuff away for three. What the hell was he thinking? It was a phenomenal thing to do because he wasn't the only one working on peer-to-peer applications but BitTorrent is the largest and it's the most recognizable of all of them. So that sort of commando behavior was critical to getting BitTorrent off the ground. The next phase is characterized by the military police who, sorry, the infantry. The commandos infantry comes into the territory that the commandos have secured and actually secure it. Start to set up a perimeter and start to try and make some sense of the rubble. The, maybe start to set up the rules a bit and then the last wave is the military police that kind of sets up the walls and establishes the territory and defends it. And so recognizing where you are in that process will help you find the right people for that point and development. And then, you know... Where's BitTorrent now? I would say we're in the infantry phase. We're still establishing our territory and still actively winning customers and refining the product. The other thing about the people that you want to pull in, I think you can tell, you know, I see some max in the audience. I think you can tell when you've got a product in your hands that's kind of this perfect blend of good engineering, good marketing, good business development, you know, good sales and all these sort of competing disciplines all hammer each other. And what you have at the end of the day is this very refined and beautiful product. And getting those forces all kind of working together in many ways, in some ways, conflicting each other. But, you know, what you have, if you've done this and you've created the right balance is a great product. And then, you know, once you've done that, then bringing in the right amount of demand generation and sales capability to market this thing effectively. Yeah, I know. I think I think the tension of sales marketing product, all these creating the right experience is probably the hardest thing you can do for a consumer app. It's this elusive, we call it the consumer democracy. The consumers will decide which apps, which servers they want to use. And they'll vote with what they end up using, right? You know, we saw this at BitTorrent, we see this at Facebook and there's these, it's just the consumers are extremely fickle. They'll change their minds very quickly and creating that right elusive experience is probably the hardest thing for BitTorrent. I mean, people talk about the protocol, which is a massively brilliant engineering project. But a lot of people forget the amount of work and effort that goes into the actual decline. I think that's sitting on your desktop so that you guys see the value of the network, value of the protocols. But, you know, I think I'd like to open this up for questions if folks have them. You spoke about establishing your territory. There are a lot of other clients out there for Torrents, Azure, C-Torrent, the findings bit porn. I'm more likely to see other clients than you are. I'm wondering, do they differentiate by having more advanced features? And how important do you care about having the territory of the client? Seems like perhaps you make your money off of having these content providers, A.U. to help them see in any case. So, just to point a clarification, we distribute you Torrent and both brands are operated and distributed by us. And by virtue of that, I think we are the most popular client by a significant margin based on the data that has been provided or has been published. But, you know, that said, yeah, client distribution is very important to us. We actually have a third distribution of the BitTorrent client, which is called the DNA client. And that's the one that we expect to be the most ubiquitous of all BitTorrent clients. And the reason is that it's actually just a control panel. And we spend a significant amount of time in refining the BitTorrent client to be extremely polite in the way it uses your bandwidth and the way that it integrates with web applications or other software applications. And the way that it works is, in fact, it's part of the infrastructure. It's part of the background processes that deliver data into a web page. And that actually functions as a web server on your desktop. So, for example, if a video streaming website wanted to deliver a video streaming from the website, you know, from the into the website into a browser, what actually happens is that once you take a little piece of JavaScript that we provide the web page, they can then have the flash player or whatever the media player is that's on the web page actually look for the content in the DNA client, which again, functions as a web server and the web, the DNA client will then pull the video from multiple sources, other peers, as well as from the servers that the website's provision to make that video available. And because of this sort of very elegant background presence that the DNA client has, we expect it to be propagated by all the customer services that end up using an expect that the DNA client will actually, it will leverage the existing user base that we have. The Bitcoin user base, but it will actually find a user base that's dramatically larger. And we have this goal that it should be as ubiquitous as the flash player, for example, because the flash player provides the same level of utility to web publishers. Does it make sense? And once you have the client, then websites that want to use it can take advantage of them immediately. So client distribution is important. Now, we've got also going to be a client that other companies or other working entities will be able to write their own version of yours. They can write applications that will, there will be APIs that they can actually hook into, but the DNA client itself is not intended to be an open source application or something like that. Yeah, and the value to you guys, the end users is you get much higher performance in terms of your downloads, right? And as you go to HD and larger files, you get the opportunity to see things at rates that you probably can't see today because the content providers throttle it back so they can save money. Now they don't have that restriction. So, go ahead. Oh, so, oh yeah. So the question is, what's the caching policy that we maintain on the desktop in the DNA implementation? And so, it functions, the DNA client functions a lot like a browser. And you know, as any user, any sophisticated user of Internet Explorer or Firefox would know that every browser maintains a cache of, you know, Web objects that you've browsed. And the DNA client functions the same way. So there's a certain amount of disk space that the DNA client will reserve to cache the data that you've consumed. And only the data you've consumed, there's no mischief going on where we're pushing data down that you don't want. And that was some mischief that other peer-to-peer clients have done and it got them in big trouble. And the users just uninstalled it. Just was very impolite. But this cache will have a policy that, you know, will purge data that's, you know, aged out of existence that you no longer need. This, the network no longer needs. Sorry. So the question is, people who thought Ashwin was crazy and then how did you get comfortable? How do we get comfortable with Ashwin being crazy? Well, I would say most entrepreneurs are commanders like Ashwin. So I think the reality is, you know, we got comfortable on a couple of dimensions. One is we saw that there was a huge opportunity here with some really fundamental deep technology solving a really big problem. I think that's kind of, you know, the first order bit that, you know, you have to believe in that there's some deep technology. And it's a really meaningful problem that they're going after. That's very distinctive. And, you know, I looked at a ton of companies in the space before investing in BitTorn and, you know, one of the things I've learned quickly is you're not a peer-to-peer network if you don't have any peers. So there's a lot of people with a lot of good technology, a lot of research, but you can't build, you can't be an effective delivery network if you don't have the massive base of 150 million clients and growing. So that's what kind of made this thing seem not so crazy, right? You were actually had a really, you know, effective technology platform to build off of. From a team perspective, you know, by time we invested, Ashwin and Bram have already kind of endeared themselves with the studios, have proved out a legitimate model for BitTorn. So I think a lot of the things that maybe the other guys thought were crazy, we thought, you know, have been mitigated, so we didn't have those concerns. And I think the third thing is we just saw that the team was, you know, excited and we shared a vision for where the company wanted to go. We understood what they were doing on the BitTorn entertainment video side of the download business, and also we saw how they can use that technology to enable others to deliver their own video or games or software or whatever it is. So I think that's a big part of when something doesn't seem as crazy as when you kind of share the vision, so maybe we're crazy too, but we're equally crazy. And I think that created the connectivity for us to want to get involved with the team. So question back to the sky's presentation. You said that you had like good relationships with the media companies, right? But what are your thoughts on how the RAA is policing like increasing amounts of websites such as like inventory is higher bank and like coin push them down like a week ago. And you know, I was wondering, because they used BitTorn, you know, exclusively on their sites, and it's like the most efficient way to share music, but you know, what are your thoughts on how the RAA is cracking down on those kinds of sites? So question is, what's my view on RAA litigation against BitTorn sites? Well, I think it's, you know, a lot of the litigation is a choice that the media, some of the media companies have made to address the piracy problem, you know, a few points. BitTorrent never was specifically designed for any one application, you know, and you make the point that, you know, it's, it's the exclusive application for these environments. I don't know that it's the best application for those environments. It definitely gets used in these environments. It is a really great way to deliver vast amounts of data. And what we've done is gone back to these media companies and said, you know, you should be using this technology to compete with piracy. And, you know, if you've, if the media companies have made their product a great price with the right usability, a good value overall, and deliver it with a good experience, meaning that's delivered fast. And users find that they're getting, you know, more than what they paid for, then piracy goes away. And so, unfortunately, litigation won't remove the piracy, won't eliminate the piracy though. And so we've been, you know, pretty clear about that with the media companies that we think the best approach is actually to compete. You talked about two things. One was the efficiency of BitTorrent Protocol and audience participating to help you with creating more efficient bit delivery. In the cost structure, where do you see there are other opportunities for creating similar efficiencies? Because I carry an impression that still you still think that cost of delivery is still pretty high. So the question is, let me actually, I'm just going to say this if I got it right, but the question is where are there opportunities to find other efficiencies in participation or in peer to peer? Opportunities to find efficiencies in content delivery beyond just using a peer to peer application. So, you know, there's some people who get really interested in multicast, for example, that, you know, if you want to find a, if you're interested in an application that's kind of like a broadcast television experience or a radio experience, and everyone has the same receiving point, they're all connected at the same time, and they don't mind that, you know, multicast can be a lot more efficient than CDNs, for example. I personally think peer to peer is a no-brainer. It's kind of like why not? Why wouldn't you use peer to peer if it's been developed and refined to the point where it only, you only use it when you need it, and when you use it, it dramatically improves the experience for everyone involved. The provider, the consumer, and the economics are just much better overall so that even the creators will have more spoils available. And that's where we are with peer to peer, so on a pure delivery perspective, I think everyone's going to custom, thanks to YouTube and BitTorrent, the open implementations, of getting what they want when they want it. And they're also grown accustomed to getting vast amounts of content diversity, you know, so like there's no network scheduler that's going to tell you the TV show that you want to watch is only available at this time and at this day of the week. Those days are, you know, going away. And so the only way to achieve the content diversity and the personalization that people have grown to expect with the efficiencies that the television broadcast medium or multicast mediums enjoy today and to really marry those two expectations is with peer to peer. So the question is how does asymmetry affect the efficiency and it's related to the question that came up earlier, which is that, you know, as you mentioned the lack of symmetric bandwidth as it is in your pan and then it really scales at a level of internet television. Then do you foresee problems? So the question is how does asymmetry affect the efficiency and it's related to the question that came up earlier, which is that we have a caching policy that ages out content from a desktop over a period of time. And we manage that policy to achieve a certain target level of efficiency that we want to achieve in the peer to peer network. The question for both of you actually are one on why you decide to make a leap in starting a company on the investment side. It's based on new interstalenex. So one of the red benefits obviously is lack of licenses, it's an expensive, huge development community. One downside of this is, you know, it's pensability and IP and patents and I kind of think, you know, when you looked at it, what made you think, well, you know, it's okay to know if you can even take this and kind of overcome what we're trying to do as a small first mover. And then the investment side, how did you get comfortable with the fact that there is a certain lack of pensability and barriers that you can create around open source. So the question is how do we get comfortable as an entrepreneur and as an investor and an open source project. And I think the, what I saw in BitTorrent was a phenomenal brand, you know, whether it was open source or not, brand would have value. Some communities and users and websites that depended on the technology were evangelical about the technology and then some communities that were, you know, really die hard about it. So that was valuable. This is in the early days. I didn't know honestly I was a bit naive in terms of how much of the IP we could actually acquire or secure at that point in time and I had to go through a process of working with lawyers to figure that out. But what I did know is that, you know, the licensing scheme that we, BitTorrent was released under was not, and this is something that you all may want to look into on your own time or maybe there's a class that does this. Open source licenses are varied. They're not, there's not one open source license. There's some that are very flexible. There's some that are what people call viral, meaning that if something starts in open source, it'll have to stay open source, no matter what you do with it. And then, you know, obviously then there's these hybrid licenses that say, okay, for certain uses, they're open source and for others, they have to go through a license. BitTorrent was a very flexible license. It was one of, it was the MIT license, which was pretty, it allowed anyone that would make something on it. Give them a lot of flexibility outside of trademark. They couldn't call it BitTorrent, but they could definitely take the code and do with it whatever they want and whatever they please. As a company, we could do the same thing. So we could actually keep, we could maintain this open source code base for the benefit of the community, but we could also develop some proprietary extensions to the protocol and to the code base that we would commercialize. And that's basically what we've done. Yeah, from an investment perspective, so we've invested quite a bit in open source models. J-Boss and ZenSource are two recent ones and a slow bothers. And I think open source is not a model for every business, so you know, don't, don't everyone go start off open source businesses. But I think there are certain dynamics about open source that are really effective. One is in terms of building a community of developers early on to kind of get this thing going and evangelizing this case. You know, Braim had his kind of community built around him to go ahead and add to the product. But over time, that's actually not where most of the values be. You end up building most of the technology yourself. Frankly, the open source community never really contributes nearly as much as the actual developer of the original, the originator of the open source. So the real value in open source, we've seen is distribution. You get free distribution, right? Whether it's Linux, you don't need a sales guy. People just download Linux. J-Boss, you don't need a sales guy. People just download J-Boss app server. So it's the ability to have distribution without a sales force. And the sales force is what cost a lot of money. Right? So what BitToron was able to do is get massive distribution, 150 million peers into my earlier comment. You're not a peer-to-peer network unless you have a lot of peers. So for us, the open source actually was a really efficient way of getting the distribution problem solved. How are you going to convince everyone down their clients unless you do kind of an open source type model. And that's kind of what we thought was particularly powerful. From a monetization perspective, like all the other great open source companies, you have to do something other than the core protocol in this case in order to monetize. And as Ash mentioned, there's a lot of proprietary extensions that we built on top that you have to basically participate and pay for. In order to get that value. But the good news is once you've already have this stuff out there, then it's a lot easier to go back to the person and say, hey, do you want to pay a little bit extra more to get this additional value? Right? So now you're 150 million peers. It's easier to go to a gaming company and say, hey, by the way, do you want to reduce your bandwidth cost by X because we got all these peers out there that is already out there. And so they can get immediate value without you having to go sell and do all that kind of work. So, you know, it's not the model doesn't fit for everything, but in this particular case, we saw open sources very smart and actually a distinctive way of getting distribution and the proprietary stuff is all the other technology that's been built on top. That's only a bit too much.
