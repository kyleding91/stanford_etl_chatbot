 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader's Series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these elections online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Good morning, Stanford. I'll tell you seeing so many students up this early in the morning is really a great experience for the President of the University. And I'm so delighted you're able to join us here and I can tell you're going to be in for a fascinating discussion this morning. If you think about our University and what makes it unique, it is that bold Entrepreneurial Spirit, that pioneering spirit that Jane and Leland brought to us when they marched across the country to come to the West Coast and help found this University. Today we remain committed to pursuing opportunities that will change the world, to using our knowledge and important ways to work on the grand challenges we face. But that Entrepreneurial Spirit is about more than just launching the next startup. It's also about training and educating people who will go out and make our world better. And those innovations come in all walks from the medical care we do and new ways of dealing with health problems, to energy efficiency, to robotics, to art, to everything we do. At every innovation, begins with an idea and every idea began with somebody who imagined it. And that's what today is about. The Stanford Technology Venture Program's Future Fest is an opportunity to examine and celebrate the impact of breakthroughs and pioneering technologies on our world. And I'm delighted you could all join us this morning. This is organized by STVP in collaboration with Stanford Arts. The Future Fest will be the place where discussions about futuristic technologies occur. And today we'll hear from two far-thinking individuals, Elon Musk and Steve Jervicin. Steve is a Stanford alum and a partner at Great Profiture Jervicin. He was recently held in the New York Times as a space investor and rocket maker. His firm has invested both in SpaceX and a satellite company, Planet Labs. Steve is a Stanford alumnus three times over and he also has the important characteristic that he was once my advisor. Despite that, this advantage, he completed his bachelor's degree in elect's engineering in two and a half years was the Henry Ford Scholar, went on to earn his MS and despite my attempts to convince him to pursue a PhD, went off and got his MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business where he was an RJ Miller Scholar. He's recognized widely for being forward-thinking. The San Francisco Chronicle and Examiner named him as one of the ten people expected to have the greatest impact on the Bay Area in the early part of the 21st century. Now, Elon Musk, I think, is a name known to everybody who thinks about the future. He is a serial entrepreneur, inventor, engineer, and investor. He was born in South Africa, attended Queen's University in Canada before moving to the U.S., where he earned his undergraduate degrees in economics and physics from the University of Pennsylvania. He arrived at Stanford to pursue his PhD in physics, but left after two days. I said, what was wrong along was the food, the water, the weather? No, he left to launch his first startup, Zip 2, a successful internet-based city guide, and then he went on to launch PayPal. He founded his third company, SpaceX, in 2002, and six years later, NASA awarded him a contract for cargo transport to the International Space Station. He was an early investor in Tesla Moda and now leads the company as its CEO and product architect. But Elon dreamed big. As he told CNN a few years ago, we should not be afraid of doing something just because some amount of tragedy is likely to occur. Before our forefathers had taken that approach, the United States wouldn't exist. Amen to that. I think when you see the kind of work that Elon's doing, and I still remember, I first stripped down the Los Angeles to visit SpaceX and to see the first Tesla prototype before it came out, I realized he was going to change the world. This will be a wonderful exchange after Stephen Elon's discussion Matt Harvey, executive director of STVP, will close the program. But now please join me in giving a warm, Stanford welcome to Elon Musk and Steve Jervicin. Thank you President Hensey and this is a daunting venue. I feel like we should sing or something. Dance perhaps. Wow. Okay, so future fest. Today is all about the future and I can't imagine a better person to speak with about that than Elon Musk. He is forging the future as you all know across multiple industries repeatedly in the most spectacular way, in a way that others have failed before him and perhaps unprecedented in history. So I'm a big fanboy. Future fest. Originally I think bounced around in why this month, this is a special month for future fest is that for those of you old enough and it looks like maybe five or six of you in the audience to have been around and back to the future, the movie came out. They had this vision of the future in the second edition of that series where they fast forwarded in a time warp to the future and it was October 2015 and they had flying cars and hoverboards and biometrics and video calls and what looked like Google Glass a lot of the times and a lot of other stuff that was completely cockamabee. But some of those dreams were true, some were not and as a framework for future fest we can think to the past and our dreams that did or didn't come true. I think that's where we'll start and then move to the future where sitting here today what do we think the future may both. So turn to Elon maybe as a starting point as you think back to your high school days, 30 years ago we were both there and dreaming of that future. What about today is or isn't in accordance with what you thought back then. Where have your dreams of the future, the bold visions met or not met reality today? Well I think the most remarkable thing that we do have today is the internet and access to all the world's information from anywhere. So that's having a super computer in your pocket is I think some people wouldn't have predicted back to the future. So that's the biggest thing and probably what they would be most surprised at is that we haven't progressed more in space. So if people would have expected I think to have a space hotel, in fact, at the clock at the time of 2001, yeah, exactly. So 2010 was really crazy, space advancement. So we would be going to Jupiter and that kind of thing. So that's probably the most surprising thing. Particularly if you go back even further if you say in 1969 when people first landed on the moon, if you'd asked the public what would the situation be in 2015? I think they would imagine that we would have a base on the moon, a base on Mars and be all over the solar system by now. That's probably the biggest. What happened? Is there any pattern you can sense for where our dreams and science fiction realities drift from reality and where they are? There's some reason you think, because we have dreams today where we're going to have these Mars colonies in their future. I have a bunch of questions by the way from the audience as well here. I want to move to something a little more current as we move forward in time. 20 years ago when we first met, we were starting your first internet company of two, the one before PayPal, Zip 2. I know that in your youth you envisioned a variety of industries that needed to change. When you were pursuing your first one, did you imagine you would get to the next one and the next one? No, I mean, when I was in college I just thought, well, what are the things that are most like to affect the future of humanity just in, you know, at a macro level? It just seemed like there would be like the internet and sustainable energy making like multiplanetary and then genetics and AI. And I thought the first three who worked on those, they were like almost certainly going to be good and then the last two a little more dodgy. In terms of the net benefit? Yeah. And for the double-edged sword and you're not sure which edge is the worst. Interesting. So it seems like begging the question, are genetics and AI the ones that are ripe for students today they'd be thinking about as they look at these things? I mean, they are. My cousin, my younger cousin who's just finishing up sort of a physics and computer science degree actually, Berkeley. It weenem. And he says everyone there is in the computer science development is working on AI. So I mean, I think we're going to see some crazy breakthroughs in the next few years on that front. Yeah. I want to come back to that later as we look more to the vision of the future. As you think back though to your younger self, many of the people in the audience are themselves college students and either undergrad or grad programs and are thinking about the world they're entering. I'm curious, this may be an odd question, but one that I find fascinating, as you think here today back to your younger self, is there any advice you wish you could be given your younger self and not with hindsight, given what you know now? Well, I give it like a lot of advice. Dating. A whole bunch of things like that. Yeah. I got you. In terms of how to think about a life trajectory perhaps or how to pursue your passions? I mean, I'm reasonably happy with how things turned out. So it's like, Touche. That's incredible. Yeah. That's a good point. I think if there's anything... It's something just to mind, let me know. But let me... Apart from the obvious, just telling my younger self exactly how the future unfolded, which is... But that's not exactly your point. More has been calculated into non-servant work. I'm working with them. Yeah. Exactly. Like wisdom. I mean, there's a lot of things. I mean, it's sort of... I mean, certainly... Yeah. I mean, you know, listen more to critical feedback. I mean, like a lot of things I learned in college were actually pretty helpful. I think the physics approach to thinking is very good, like the first principles approach. And you applied that broadly? Yeah. I think the first principles approach to thinking is, I think, a good way to figure out a counter intuitive situation. And I thought that was really a helpful thing to learn. That's good. Yeah. I mean... Oh, yeah. Oh, sorry, guys. No, no, no. I feel free to jump in. I don't know how I'd answer that question. I mean, other... Yeah, what would you do? I'd really like to listen to your speaker, so... It'll be all right. You weren't as dorky as you think. That would be advice like that. Nothing really, too actionable. Don't worry about it. Well, Ro, just don't be so insecure about everything you're insecure about. Yeah, I would probably be advised to myself. But let's move on. This is what I'm used to thinking about me. So, you know, I may be roughly overgeneralizing here, but it seems to me that there's often a trigger problem that generates, in your mind, a great solution for when you come up with a new company. So, for example, when trying to negotiate with the Russians for launch capacity, the aha, that at least you just build a better rocket that solve this problem comes forth. Or when you deal with the commute on the floor of fire, whatever, in LA, it's like, my god, what is wrong with mass transit and perhaps hyperloop and then, you know, with a variety of ideas. There seems to be some trigger. You know, you've been in the world and you have an idea about how to fix it. And I guess what I'm curious about is not how you've picked the areas of interest in the solutions, but how have you decided what not to perfect another word? There's many things that need fixing in the world and students here probably could think of a long list. Many of which you could probably imagine solutions to using the physics first principle approach. But has there been any framework or idea of you to filter out what you don't do, what you don't pursue? Yeah, I mean, well, if sort of follow what I did initially was, you know, you go back to like college times I was working on energy storage technologies for electric vehicles. And that's what I was going to pursue at Stanford actually was work on like advanced capacitors and batteries to improve the energy density for electric vehicles. And then the internet was kind of happening. It was clear like the internet was happening like back in like 94, 95. And I wasn't sure if what I worked on in the PhD would actually be useful. So I was like, I was really concerned that it might be. Why, timing or what was your intuition? Meaning I think like it could be academically useful, but not practically useful. Like I think you could result in a PhD and adding some leaf to the tree of knowledge. Then discovering that well, it's not really going to matter. Like, is it going to be a good enough thing to actually be used in electric vehicles? I wasn't sure. I mean, so it was like, I was uncertain as to whether success was one of the possible outcomes. Like I thought maybe it was, but I wasn't sure. And then I thought, well, if I watch the internet get built while I'm doing this, that would be really frustrating. There's a sense of that eminent timing that that was the time for the internet and maybe other stuff could wait or be on the back. Back to your mind, was it always there? Is like one day I'll get back to that or was it just like? Yeah, I thought probably I'd get back to it and did it end up doing that. But yeah, I thought sort of the the the internet was was happening. Like really taking off. All the most people went and wear it in 95. And so I figured like electric vehicle technology, energy storage technology, there will be some sort of natural progression in that. And I could come back to it later. But the internet, you know, it was really that was the moment to really do something. Although in 95, it wasn't obvious that you could actually make any money on the internet. This was like nobody until Netscape went public, I think at the end of 95, nobody even thought there was like you could make a valuable company on the internet. Wasn't as obvious as it seems now. Yeah, like now it seems really obvious, but back then it was not at all. So it was really from the perspective of it wasn't like, oh, I want to make a bunch of money. It was actually from it's like I want to just be part of filling this thing that I thought was like a nervous system. It was like previously people had communicated effectively by osmosis. And you'd have like basically physically connect with somebody to really communicate you're like a letter. Like you said letters like that in wallpaper. And with the internet, anyone who had a connection anywhere in the world would have access to all the world's information just like sort of a nervous system. So humanity was effectively becoming super organism and qualitatively different than what had been before. And so I wanted to be part of that. And yeah, so but initially the goal was just to make enough money to pay the rent. It wasn't there to do anything beyond that. And then as many know that much of that capital has then got plugged back and do your next businesses. Right, exactly. So then the internet is also helpful because anything through the software is a low capital endeavor. So I didn't have any money. I just had a bunch of student debt. And so that's what software you can just write like by yourself. And you don't need a lot of atoms like you don't need a lot of tooling and equipment. And so it's like capital intensive. So the ability to start a company if it's software related and it's the first company is much much easier. Right. And it seems obvious now that of course the easier place to start and then as you gain more of a personal reputation and have more personal capital as some marrying. I know SpaceX was almost entirely funded by Elon for its first period partially from you know and in an era when others probably wouldn't have funded it in those arrives the days. Well, and actually I mean the precursor to SpaceX was not the idea wasn't really to create a company. It was to try to figure out why we hadn't gone 10 people to Mars. So we went from sub 2 to PayPal and then going from PayPal to the next thing I was sort of thinking well it is a some way to reignite the dream of Apollo. And I thought well it was maybe a question of like we'd lost the will to explore it. But I actually think that my original premise was wrong. We'd not lost the will to explore but people did not think there was a way. And if I don't think there's a way then they just they weren't actually heading against the wall continuously they'll sort of give out. So but in the beginning I thought it was a question of will. So if we can send a small greenhouse to the surface of Mars and you have seeds and nutrient gel and you hydrated upon landing and then you'd have this little greenhouse on the surface of Mars and people tend to respond to precedence and subordinates. And this would be the first life on Mars as far as we knew. But this the lives of a travel you have this great shot of green plants on our red background and I thought well maybe that would give people excited about sending people to Mars. So the headlines were clear in your mind. When you had success on what that would lead to the catalyzed action. And actually the goal was to the public excited about that and get NASA's budget increased. So that was actually the original goal and so I went to Russia to try to buy some ICBMs in 2001. It's an interesting experience. A lot of vodka. Yeah a lot of vodka. Yeah it's crazy. And I couldn't afford the regular rockets like the Boeing and Lockheed rockets are too expensive. Still aren't. Yes, it's very expensive. I'm sorry. What could have made you up in here for a second because the anecdote you brought up of wanting to change government policy and inspire the world to have a Mars program if you will whether it's popular uprising or space programs at the government level. I think it's a fascinating anecdote because in a sense what you were saying is I as an individual want to start a entity business that will catalyze change even beyond the company level or the industry level. And I see a parallel in other initiatives you've taken on in that if you look at the goal of Tesla under your leadership it is to share the transition to all vehicles being electric not just the cars that currently are produced by Tesla. And with Powerwall and Solicity arguably the description is one of ushering in a wholesale shift to renewable energy many of the solutions required wouldn't be provided by the companies you're starting. And so as I deal in entrepreneurship as a venture capitalist every day we see this incredible scope of ambition here that is breathtaking. I change the world with Steve Jobs and others talk about it in a company maybe shifting an industry but we're talking about shifting the entire zeitgeist of the world in a sense and maybe eventually other worlds. So my question is do you start always in your mind with that as a like I said what's the starting point is it okay I see this arc of a story like the Mars example or renewable energy and then do you pull back to where's the best product to get it unstuck like why isn't this happening and like if I solve that problem then it unlocks value I like how does that happen in your mind. Sure so I mean I should say like when we started SpaceX and Tesla I mean I really thought the probability of success was very low I mean it wasn't like I think oh we'll definitely be successful I thought I thought we'd be like maybe 10% likely. Well yeah and then we came very close to both companies not succeeding in 2008 you know we had the we'd had three failures of the space of the SpaceX rocket so we were zero for three we had the crazy financial recession like the great recession the Tesla financing round full and a pot because it's like pretty hard to raise money for the start of car company if GM and Chrysler going bankrupt like people. It's partly for the upside. Yeah that was tricky one and you know unfortunately at the end of 2008 the fourth launch which was that was the last launch we had money for worked for SpaceX and and then we closed the Tesla finance round as you know Christmas Eve 2008 last hour of the last day that was possible. Yeah thanks to you for those that don't know it's the most extraordinary act of entrepreneurial zeal and commitment I've ever seen where you'll unpersonally save Tesla in those hours like when no one else would write a check he spoke for it all and that flipped the mentality from fear to greed and everyone joined the bandwagon and and everything changed from you know dividing into the ground to success but you were willing to go like net negative personally of isn't dire net worth and it's a remarkable story. Oh thanks for supporting by the way that was much much appreciated. Yeah we weren't happy to fall right behind in line but but it was all him. So I guess on this this idea of the big picture I'm curious in the way I heard you just now described the greenhouse and the headlines is interesting. Do the marketing headlines flash to your mind as you introduce new products that are a step to a much grand revision. I'm curious because it seems like it has two purposes like getting employees customers everyone really gung ho about the vision but it also makes it larger than life in so many ways. Well if you're trying to convince the public to do something you have to say okay how's this going to read and what message are we going to try to convey what will people respond to what would I respond to if I was you know sort of an objective member of the public and so that's that's really you know if you're trying to change people's minds or get people fired up about something then you go to think okay what's that message what's going to get them really excited and that's really good advice by the way you're all engineering students. Yeah I was a woman as well. I'm curious there's a adjunct sometimes to these grand visions like making humanity a multi planetary species or shifting us to renewable energy or making all vehicles electric that has a purpose driven element to it. There's a higher calling than the quarterly bottom line. In fact it was a Tesla Co other report I remember famously where the opening the literally opening line was while profits are not a priority. Come on. You know never less. Exactly. And it occurred I was struck by it at first and it did occur to me that it's not like a miss some sort of misdirected fiduciary question to me it seems like how could you lead an industry transition if your business model was worse than what's already there. Meaning like if you weren't more profitable in the long term and a better business why would anyone shift right. So it almost seems like with the right purpose profits follow. Yeah well if you make up if the you know if the output is more valuable than the inputs which is really that's that's that's profit like the output is more valuable than the input. That says you're having a useful company. So no in a high growth scenario you have a lot more inputs for for future outputs so that you have negative cash flow and lack of profitability and which we currently have a Tesla but in the long term of course that has to be that has to be fixed. They can't be negative cash flow in long term and that there needs to be a net positive output which is sort of profits in the long term but in the short term when this high growth that that doesn't it isn't the most sensible thing. And then there's also related things like open sourcing patents and acts that to me relate to the purpose let's let the whole lot of industry do this and I'm curious what do you see from your vantage point as the benefits of a purpose driven company meaning when you have this thing that every employee and customer knows is the purpose of the company how do you see that flowing through to benefits for the company. Well I think I think having a purpose certainly is going to attract the the very best talent in the world because if if people can if there's something that's intrinsically enjoyable and the fragile words are good but then also it's something that's going to genuinely change the world and that's pretty powerful motivator and but I don't think like everything needs to change the world you know. Honestly like there's lots of like useful things that people do and I mean I think really it should be like a usefulness optimization like just say like it's what I'm doing as useful as it could be. Did you say the goal of an organization or a goal in general yeah and you know just even if something isn't changed in the world if it's making making people's lives better I think that's that's great and you know even if something's like making all the people's lives only slightly better but it's a large number of people they kind of like the area under the coast is quite good. Is that mathematical first principles appointing utility and number exactly. I mean it's like one can say like is like some app really making people's lives better but it's a bit of it's affecting a lot of people even in a small way than yeah that these sort of areas good. So that's just yours a little bit since it is future-fest looking to the future right we started 30 years in the past but the future keeps accelerating so let's maybe look 20 years in the future for an equivalent leap arguably five years in the future might be equivalent to the past 30 but let's say 20 so the year 2035 what does the future look like as far as you can tell what would you. 20 20 or yeah 2035 yeah 20 years. It's always really tricky to predict the future. I mean some of it's pretty obvious like computing power is going to be just crazy. The really the big change is the cost of computing power not so much the sort of circuit density sort of the most law thing but if you if you look at say what is the actual you know dollars per instruction and that that is draw I mean that that that cost is is dropping exponentially. Maybe think about it like if you're making a computer just you're rearranging silicon and copper you know so you're on a little chip and once the capital cost of the development and the the chip plant is paid for the the actual I mean the the module cost of a chip is very very tiny so I think we'll see massively parallel computers and computing power and storage being you know as really as much as you want. And it's interesting I too start with that like if I I know the way else to predict but as a foundation for sure this seems like the safest starting you know premise but then what does that ripple through to and feels like genetics in the eye which you mentioned in autonomous driving space related topics. I mean just you ubiquitous computing everywhere like AI is going to be incredibly sophisticated in 20 years. And first I can seem to be accelerating and the tricky thing about predicting things when there's an exponential is that an exponential looks like looks linear close off. And but it's actually it's not linear so and AI appears to be accelerating as far as I can see. And for that you look at autonomous driving and point AI is like the series like functionality as your guide post. Well I had to debate about someone like is AI accelerating or not and the like he was like well what's the y-axis you know if it's accelerating you get t on the x-axis but what's what's the y-axis is well thought about that I think you could have a recursive y-axis so that if at any point in time your predictions for AI are coming sooner or later that actually would help to find whether it's accelerating or not. Whatever that x-axis was. So you mentioned it's a recursive axis like so if in any given year if you if you find your predictions are going further out or coming further or coming close to REN that that actually you know is one way to think of acceleration because like otherwise what's the what's the quality of what quite a measure of AI. I give a given technology is always 20 years in the future. Yeah if it's always 20 years in the future it's like more logarithmic. So I think I seem like it's one of the most fast we accelerating things that you're aware of. Yes and I can certainly say that with with autonomous driving where you know three years ago I thought it was 10 years away and that two years ago I thought it was five years away now I think it's three years away or less than three years wow. So and when you say away like like release to market available for consumer adoption because as opposed to prototyping. No I mean like like the technology works there's this sort of second question as to when regulators would approve it. Yeah yeah yeah yeah but like look at that. Technology works in a technology works as a general solution so like time is driving like waste cost anywhere. So it could be sooner for point things like highway only or I mean highway only we're already in public beta with this Tesla so we'll be hopefully in the next several weeks releasing to two all of the cars that have the autopilot hardware which is all cars buttoned like roughly the last 12 months. Wow. And so this seems like one of those things that once you've experienced it the inevitability of it becomes more apparent kind of like first time I sat in an electric vehicle it's just so clear and same with autonomous vehicles. Do you think that will help persuade public opinion and like like regulatory question is an interesting one because technology can easily accelerate human nature it doesn't and acceptance of change and just not sure if there's like as we look out in the future it should be assumed that no matter how fast something like Moore's Long accelerates there's always the counter balancing force of human nature inhabit. Yeah I mean this yeah I think yeah there's always going to be sort of is always going to be human nature and it's difficult to predict I think what what what that will how that will affect things but I'm sure I fully answer your question so in terms of what what I think 25. Oh yeah please. So for sure you're victims computing AI that's beyond anything like the public to appreciate today I think we'll have most of the new vehicles being produced being electric and we'll probably have the super majority of energy being produced being sustainable so I think I think we're on headed solar primarily in your mind. I really saw it yeah and so I think those I think those are sort of some good things I think we'll be on hopefully on a good path for sustainable energy. Yeah sooner is always better but I think by 2035 I think we'll be substantially like most of transport most of new energy being produced will be sustainable broadband everywhere. Roadbound everywhere yeah. Mars colony and hopefully hopefully a small base on Mars or city on Mars in 20 years yeah. I think I'm going to sit in did I hear? Well okay fine town village. Hamlet. I mean that's exciting I mean that could get people fired up about the future. Yeah I do I agree exactly I think that the idea of being moly-fantasticies and getting out there and exploring the stars is one of those really inspiring exciting things. I mean just as Apollo was incredibly inspiring to everyone around the world and even those I mean only a very tiny number of people went there but I mean by curiously we all went there and I think that's true of if we have a Mars base as well and it's very important that we have things that are exciting and inspiring the future because otherwise I get up in the morning you know it was just about one sort of sad problem after another it's like life's not worth living. Are there any other things that excite you a lot about the future beyond the multi-planetary species perhaps AI hopefully may scare you as well as excite you the autonomous vehicles are there any other planks that you think looking forward 20 years of like this is what I really get excited about. Well I mean for sure for sure Mars and sustainable transport like those items I think that are really and sustainable energy those are I think really cool things and I mean in terms of getting excited about I mean it's I think we'll probably start seeing like more like truly cyborg activity like human brain interface like like like brain computer interfaces. Like there's a lot inside the AI's that are purely yeah yeah I think so it's the only way we can relate I think you know and have a conversation yeah and there are amazing things happen like happening these days like this they've been able to figure out how to do an artificial hippocampus in rats and monkeys and and now they're looking at doing that to solve severe epilepsy but half of severe epilepsy cases originate in the hippocampus and by having sort of an artificially augmented hippocampus they can actually solve the severe epilepsy cases. So it's like I'm like wow and you can you can read and write information back to the chip from your brain at the individual neuron level like today. Pretty exciting yeah the whole field or as estuides says always make new mistakes as as if failure is the crucible of learning that curious if you had any further thoughts on that and that maybe off the cuff comment you made out there. Well I mean there are many that sort of I mean I think there's sort of there's like some entropic basis for this like there are many more ways to fail than to succeed so you I mean you have to explore I mean particularly like for a rocket there's like a thousand ways of thinking fail in like one way it can work so you could you could have a lot of rocket failures to explore all the ways in which you could fail. So but I do think that one great thing about the Silicon Valley is that failure is not a not a big stigma so it's like if you if you try hard and it doesn't work out that's okay like you can learn from that and you know do another company and it's not a big deal and I think that's that's really one of the great things about Silicon Valley. Interesting do you also curious if either on the well it seems to me that on the system design side you can accommodate a likely failure of subcomponents and so much of the elegance of let's say a Falcon nine or a Falcon nine heavy as an ultimate incarnation of this vision of how the rocket should be built to say hey parts will fail thing but here's how the system can succeed and I'm curious if there's any other thoughts along that how to how to accommodate anticipated failure and then also maybe inter like in managerially is there ways that you motivate the team either in advance of failure to everything has to work the first time like there's there's no you can't do a recall you can't patch it it's got it's like nine minutes to orbit or it's over and and then the you know you can't you can never test the rocket completely in the environment that it's actually going to experience you can't fully recreate something that's moving super fast in a vacuum on the surface of a like you can only really record recreate that on in space so that limited the simulation tools all right is that a limit of the simulation tools today or is that a problem yeah absolutely if the if there's any error between the simulation and reality and there's always some amount of error then then that that can result in the failure so it's a really really tricky one it's like in a software analogy it would be like if you had to write a whole bunch of software modules and you can never run them together and you can run them on the target computer like like when you're testing them you don't have to test them individually and not in the actual computer that they're going to run on then you put them put all the modules together run it for the first time in a completely different very different computer and it has to run with no bugs that is difficult yeah the software analogies to rocket design are deep modular reuse I think there's many of these like this is a little soar in from there it's not like this is an aerospace engineer by traditional training coming but but is in fact radically changing industry I think applying a CS perspective to industry after industry I'm like how would you know computer scientists or physicists approach the problem which oftentimes the solution very unlike the industry incumbents there's a certain elegance to it at least from the outside as I deserve like myself let me switch if I may to some student questions which would be completely in a different direction first one comes to Nixu in an architectural design coach room so it's a be switching more to the other side of our brain for a moment what do you look for in design and related if you'd like what do you look for in art design might be more immediately relevant that's where he's coming from sure consistent among people I mean not not completely so people like me not everyone likes the same thing but there are there's a lot of commonality and and and there yeah and there but I think it is important to combine aesthetic design with functionality like the thing that's like if you say like what was really hard about say the model s or the model x was to combine aesthetics and utility so to balance the two you can make a car look very good by giving it sort of so proportions like making it sort of low and slim but if you if you do that the utility is significantly affected so the big challenge with the say the model s was trying to figure out how do we get five adults plus two kids because I want to have seven here it seems like the dragon and every Tesla is room for seven seven five children I can see yeah might be an important design for owner I don't think we should take the whole family on the spacecraft but but but like the big challenge with the like with with yes was having a car that had a high utility and looked good and the same with the x so like it like with the to make a sports car look good is relatively easy but to make a sedan look good or an sd look good is quite difficult and I don't think another principle is you want to have it feel bigger on the inside then it looks on the outside and that's also a really hard thing to do and then really pay attention to the little details the the nuances of design and shape and form function and the you know just the way it looks in different lights and when something is off the little thing how do you experience that it drives me bananas yeah I mean it's and the problem is like if you you can train yourself to to pay attention to the tiny details I think almost anyone can um well though it this is very much double-edged sword because then you see all the little details and then little things drive you crazy so but like most people don't they don't see they don't consciously see the small detail let me go to one other question I found that one interesting I I had no idea where that was going to go so I really appreciate that question Nick thank you um let's see what you want of these do on it there's some combination of questions let me mention both you can pick which one you like more because they both relate to colonizing Mars one comes from Henning Roto Lepich decadent and civil and environmental engineering which just asks you on given your plan to bring a bring a million colonists to Mars what are the pressing future technologies that need to develop in order to support a robust and thriving surface colony so it's technology for like a survival and then maybe related from the Stanford Space Initiative students how do you envision humans governing a separate planet how much your I had to think about that yet a little bit about those things I mean the obviously the first challenges just getting there at all and like that's you know so SpaceX is working super hard on figuring out just how to get large numbers of people and cargo to Mars um and I think and we've got something that I think works at a sort of fundamental physics and economics level so it's a big question of figuring out the detailed design um which we're working on we're only spending like half an hour a week on it because of like pressing the system of other companies figuring out it's like what are you gonna get there then you get the then that the opportunities watch mirrors are tremendous and that ranges everything from you know everything you can imagine like sorting the food you know like the first Italian restaurant or something on Mars you know it's like somebody's got to do it that'll be kind of cool um you know like a iron iron refinery you know like the whole the entire base of industry um and and then there probably would be things like that are just you need to Mars but we got up we got to get that you know effectively that Union Pacific Railroad there in order to get get the entrepreneurs there that and and then create a fertile environment for them to create companies so that that's so so once you're there it's it's gonna be I think a lot of exciting things they can be done and in the beginning you know people would live in kind of glass domes but over time they were terraform Mars and make it like Earth and so so I think it's just be a lot of super exciting things that are hard to predict just like when they're building Union Pacific they it would hardly nobody would predict its looking valley and Molliewood right you know that that's would have been like an urbanization in general yeah well the California would be like the most popular state in the country like they're like that sounds crazy for them gold is discovered yeah so and so the yeah I think like it's really in common on SpaceX or you know maybe other organizations to figure out how to get there well otherwise nothing else matters and then once you get there's a lot of sort yeah a lot that could be done from a governance standpoint you know obviously ultimately the governance of ours will be up to the Martians but the we have a name for them we come on Martian but but I think if you said like how would you do democracy to might know you know or like some a new version I think we'd probably have more of a direct democracy than a representative democracy and you know when the when the United States was formed it was really it was impossible to have a direct democracy like you know like you don't even sending a letter took weeks so there was no way that people could like vote directly on issues you had to have representatives interesting so I think I think probably there would be more direct democracy and is this thing about the latency of communication from it that would be all latency same I just like communication errors and communication latency when you have letters that take weeks to get anywhere would have made you know governance almost impossible I think if if it hadn't been a representative democracy yeah a lot of people couldn't even read or all right you know so that's fascinating just wondering like probably we would let it would aim for a more direct democracy and then that in a particular layer page about this and he had a like a good suggestion like we should limit the number of words in the law because like we have these like thousand page laws like it masks and like nobody's read them Twitter equivalent to the parsimony yeah like I don't know a thousand word better counter something like if you can if you can't write the law in a thousand words then probably it shouldn't be there and you know just which we shouldn't have you know a single law passed that's like the size of order the rings it's right and like literally not a single person in congress has read the whole thing make a tax code it's unscrupible yeah it's exactly so that's what does that and I think um laws also have an infinite lifespan unless they're given some sort of you know sunset periods are probably we go to default laws to to have a sunset period like you know if it's not if it's not good enough to be renewed then it then it goes away and and maybe some histories in that in making it easier to remove a law then to put one in place um it can just imagine because like over time like the the body of law just gets bigger and bigger and bigger it's like you like how do you avoid that um and and you have inertia associated with laws and and so maybe you know it would take 60% to create a law but only 40% to remove a law um interesting fascinating yeah yeah something like that there's like the rules of a constitutional democracy have such a profound impact and uh to have a a new playground would be fantastic um there there's something embedded in what you said a moment ago that on a highlight on a transition to that perhaps a closing question uh you heard in passing you know I think about some of these things about a half hour a week if I heard you right and um this is I think a profound thing to do dwell on is that you know he's changed in the world in so many areas and not many entrepreneurs I see get and myself and included enamored with all of the possibilities of a future Mars base of the terraforming of the every aspect of it that might need to come into being and and I find myself often distracted by those future questions that are a little less relevant today and what you just heard was we got to solve the railway first like let me put 90% 90% of my effort into that and not get distracted by all the other interesting questions that need to come later and I remember uh two years ago maybe three four years ago trying to get you to brainstorm with Craig Ventor about you know doing a sample return from Mars and sending a genetic sequencer there to help understand life there might exist etc and I remember profoundly that the response was that a really interesting topic but I got to get these rockets to work first before that's going to be relevant to me and let me uncardown on what's important here and that ability to prioritize it on the stepping stones to a huge vision it's this interesting dichotomy like not just pure visionary scattered across many things alone it's clear to the sense of where we're heading changing back to the present and making sure we're taking the right steps to not in a fumble the future if you will I think I wish we could all do that in the way we try to implement change so let me move if I made a one last question which could be broad or not which is there's a lot of people here from all kinds of parts of the world and I think everyone who hears your story you know immigrant from South Africa to Canada to the US taking on four or five different industries with great aplomb and success is inspiring but it's not just that your five business success or technology success it's that you really are changing the world for the better in these areas and so I guess maybe if I had a closing question again looking from the present to the future what do you see as the sort of the biggest pressing problems they need to be addressed this may in fact require to pull that filter off for a moment on the things the world that are broken and if everyone here in the audience could be a change agent themselves in their area of passion what would you hope to catalyze today if you'd say guys go solve this big hairy problem figure out why it's broken I you know I see I don't think everyone needs to go you know try to solve like some big big world changing problem I mean I think that like if I really think like we should just think like are we doing something that's useful to the world like if you're doing something useful that's great I imagine it's like animals I really think some things are more useful sure sure but like maybe one of your personal things like I just think like like you sort of be useful in this optimization is like that's like a really good thing you know if you've done something that's useful to your fellow human beings that's you've done a really good thing and people should feel pretty proud of doing that you know it doesn't it doesn't always have to be something that's gonna change the world I mean sometimes the world to just keep going in a particular direction yeah might be going in the right direction and and I mean in a lot of ways that the world is and we're we're in great shape in that if you look at say violent crimes have per capita in the world it's at an like all-time low we're actually quite prosperous and you know compared to history and you know I think there's a lot of things to feel good about in terms of how the world is today access to information is incredible I mean anyone with like a hundred-dollar device could have access to basically all the wealth information which is an incredible thing and yeah so I honestly I just think like the best thing for people to try to do is say like hey what is something that I can do that would really be useful to the world and just do that you know it's great well fantastic thank you
