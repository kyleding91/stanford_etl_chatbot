 You were listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader's Series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Today we are incredibly fortunate. We have Michael Tubbs kicking off the corner and he is an inspiration. He was elected as the youngest city council member in Stockton, California's history earning over 60% of the citywide vote. He ran for office while he was a Stanford student. Most recently he came back to Stanford for a year to be a D-school fellow and is now running for mayor of Stockton. He is here today to share his story, his passions, his motivations and his experiences as an entrepreneur leader in the public sector. Please join me in welcoming Michael. I'll get a hug. There you go. Well first of all happy New Year. Thank you so much for having me. Before I started a quick confession, I had no idea what a big deal this class was until about last week. I just got back from the Rose Bowl. I was looking at my cat, yeah go Stanford. I was looking at my calendar and I just talked with Tina Seely. That's what I put talk with Tina Seely, like me and Tina went on what. So then she calls me and we are going over to talk and she sits me to the website and I see people like my rain power jobs and the Sequoia guy next week and I went week after week after week after week and I said thank God I'm first. So thank you so much for having me and I'm excited. I really want to structure this talk in like three dimensions. So first I want to talk about sort of the startup phase or campaigning and some of the lessons learned from there that may be helpful in your entrepreneurial thought life. Secondly I want to talk about the scale up or ramp up phase which I would call kind of the governing phase after campaigning. What does it mean to be an elected official? How do you govern? How do you create policy? And then I went to end with some new challenges and new horizons. So I started running for office. If someone would have told me my freshman year at Stanford that I would be a city council person in Stockton. I would have looked at them and told them they were crazy. I had no intention of coming back to Stockton. I was kind of upset. Stanford was so close to home. I went to be as far away from home as possible. And it's not because home was a bad place or a place I didn't love or didn't have people I liked was because home was difficult and challenging. But I realized that Stanford allowed my passions came from sort of the pains. Growing up in poverty with a single parent and incarcerated father made me really, really passionate about things like inequality, things like poverty, things like mass incarceration. And I realized even before I ran for office, I sort of my pain points were leading me to what I think are thought my passion or purpose might be. And then by junior year, I was interning in the White House through the Stanford government program. And my job was when the office of integral mental affairs, now I was supposed to work with mayors and council members nationwide. Crazy foreshadowing. And I hated it. I, which is also kind of foreshadowing. I'm joking. But I hated it. I spent 12 hours a day googling what the mayor of the red-o-texas was doing or googling what Cory Booker was doing in Newark or what Kesson Reed was doing in Atlanta. And it was so, so, so boring. But it opened my eyes to how people were making big changes and a small, really local level that no one really knew or cared about. So I remember talking to my boss and saying, you know what, one day I'm going to support people in Stockton because Stockton is my hometown, it's my community, it's the place and need of good governance. I thought I would be the donor, the funder. And then someone else could do the messy work of going to the meetings and dealing with people who may, you may or may not like. And then around the same time on Halloween, one of my first cousins was murdered at a house party in Stockton. And sadly in Stockton, even today, we made some strides but for far too many young people, especially young men of color, homicides, a premature death are almost a fact of life. But it was the first time it was so, it was in my family, so it hit me really personally. And I remember flying back home for the funeral and dealing with the pain and the anger and the frustration, like, why did this happen? I remember having the console, my aunt and my mother and my cousins and how to squelch beef and make sure people didn't retaliate. And I realized that all the great time I was having that Stanford, whether it was interning at Google or being in the White House or having access to great speakers and lecture series like this, had to be for much more than my own personal fulfillment. It had to be so much bigger than me getting the degrees and making a lot of money. That for some reason that my part or the stage, which I was supposed to play my life, meant that I would have to go back to Stockton and run for office one day. So I told my mom, you know what mom? One day when I'm 30, 34, 38, 42, 50, I'll come back to Stockton and help out because it really needs help. But then my senior year, I was applying for fellowships and jobs and I didn't get what I thought was mine. I was at the entitled Stanford student. I had good grades. I had worked hard. I had the best wrecks. I had the best resume. I thought for sure that was my job and my purpose in life to be a Rhodes scholar. That's just what was going to happen for me. So I put all my eggs in that basket and then the workout for me. So they are never being so upset, so hurt. Like I thought I found my purpose. This was supposed to be doing it. No, I can't do it. And I start with that because in all these value experiences, all these low points, whether growing up in poverty or losing my cousin or not getting the fellowship that really clarified the path that I was going to take. So I gave a tattoo I said for two years ago, talking about transforming value experiences into mountain top ones. And that's the first point I want to start with today. It's that it was in these value experiences, these low points that gave me the clarity. I needed to figure out whether it was what I was doing. It was in the failures and the rejections and the pain that I found purpose. And it was in all these low points that I was able to recalibrate, refocus and figure out that was my job to run for office and stock in one day. So February 20th, 2012, after a sign language class, I rushed down the stock then for my campaign kickoff. I was going to run for city council in Stockton. And the second lesson from the campaign is that I did an expert advice. Really isn't all that expert. When I was first running for office, first of all, people said I was crazy, which is partly true. They were like, you're crazy. Stockton just had back to back years of record homicides. You're crazy. You're running and getting incumbent who's chair of his party. You're crazy because there's no way the city of Stockton is going to like a 22, 21 year old at the time. Black kid from South Stockton to helping its resurgence. There's no way. You're crazy. And then when I said I was going to run anyway, all the experts, the consultants, the people who make a lot of money to advise, the people who've been doing this for a long time, they said, you know what, Tubbs, you're young. So I grew up on facial hair. I'm trying, you see. They said you're young. Well, some facial hair is so you look a little bit older. Or they said you're young. So stay away from young people and youth issues. Don't speak to any of that. Talk about grown up issues. And then they said, talk about the bankruptcy. Talk about how the city is bankrupt and finances. And that's what's going to resonate with voters. And luckily, being 21 and a little bit dumb and foolish, we didn't listen to any of that. Because what we found in knockin' on doors and talking to people, that my youth is what made people most excited. We had seven-year-old ground mothers from the south side in the north side saying that, wow, I like the fact that you're young. That gives me hope for my grandchild or my child. We had armies of young people knockin' on doors every Saturday. And it's hard. It's easy to close a door in like a Jehovah's Witness. It's easy to close a door in a salesman. It's hard to close a door in the 12-year-old or a door of a kid who's saying Michael Tubbs for a city council. And we found that, seriously, it works. And we found that every single thing that experts were telling us to do, although true for them, we're wrong in the special case of this campaign. Also, in addition, experts also talked about things like, don't only talk to people who vote. But before we hired the campaign consultant, we had no idea what we were doing. So I said, to win a race, you have to knock on doors and talk to people. But I didn't know there was any strategy to that. I thought you just picked a neighborhood. You knocked on every door. You talked to everybody, and that's how you win. So that's what we did. But we started with what I learned at the D-school to be done as extreme users. We started in one of the poorest housing developments in the city, probably not with a lot of voters. And we spent two weeks just knocking on every door there, talking to them about their hopes, their aspirations, and what they wanted for the city. But we then talked into this extreme user group, the group that wasn't on our nation-builder files that won't show up on voter registration roles, that we found our campaign message. It was really one about moving the city forward, and that many communities have felt bankrupt for a long time. That the city's financial bankruptcy was only a symptom of a deeper bankruptcy in leadership, in rural bankruptcy and in bankruptcy in a vision. And that's what we ran on. So everyone was talking about the fiscal constraints and bankruptcy really important topics. But for voters, they want to talk about what's the vision for Stockton. People were talking about entitlement reform and things of that sort, very important conversations. But the voters we talked to were like Mr. Tuzz, we've been feeling bankrupt for a long time. Are we going to be able to listen to gun shots, it's violent, it's not safe. And it's so, so funny because afterwards, when we got the experts in, we stopped doing a lot of that outreach, not our hard work, and talking to people who may not vote because of resource constraints. But I'm hungry, cement, there's no way we would have picked the message I'd resonated with so many people. If we had not talked to the extreme users, the people who don't vote, the people who aren't going to donate because they really helped define the message and one that resonated at Citywide. So on November 6, 2012, we actually won the election with more votes than any other candidate running for any city council seat. We won with 62% of the vote in the first time running. And it was crazy, and it's because of these lessons really around sort of valid experiences, being mountain ones, really around expert opinion, being not so expert. And then the last lesson from the campaign is this idea that those who are with you then will be with you when our campaign was ran by my best friends from college, my girlfriend, my best friends from high school and my family. And that was the core. So oftentimes when people didn't show up, when people didn't believe, when people didn't invest the time and energy needed to run the campaign, the people that were with me back then, when I was a 16 year old and self-stocked and just trying to find a college, or when I was at Stanford running crazy on the basketball courts at Ariaga or at Ujra, they said, I'm Drake Lounge parties in Ujra, maybe? Maybe not. Okay. But the people I was with, Ujra, my partner, those are the same people that helped power my campaign. In fact, my best friend from Stanford, Cameron Henry, he came up with the idea of re-invent stocked in. We were in Kimball. We were sitting down. I told him, Cameron, I'm running for city council. He said, Tubbs, I'm applying for med school. How can I help? And then he ended up designing our websites, designing our flyers and coming up with this idea of re-invent stocked in. That's really been residing and still has a following and a hashtag and really a movement around it to this day. And it was important because I think oftentimes, as we get older, as we think about scaling, we forget about, we always want new connections and new people. We need to connect with this person. Are that person, but my experience has taught me that those periphery relationships are important. But really those people that have been with me before the campaign, before the idea, before anything, people who are with me just eating and talking, who have really been the base and really helped me build my campaign. So those are the four lessons from the startup phase. And now I want to talk a little bit about after you're elected, after the fanfare, after all that, how do you govern? So in the wrap up and scale phase, I think there's also been three lessons. The first lesson has been this idea of don't despise small beginnings. I'm not a technical expert, but from what I've read and from the people I've talked to, it seems like everyone's obsessed with this idea of scale. Like I have this small idea of how do I scale it 100x times and things like that. And the politics is almost the same way. People get one office and they think about, okay, how do I go from city council to you win and buster or how I go from city council to you win secretary general. It's crazy. I'm like, wait, wait, wait. Start with city council. And in the first lesson I've learned since being an office is don't despise the small beginnings or the startup phase because those lessons I shared with you are really the lessons that help govern the decisions I make every single day. It's it's it's have the door slammed in my face and being chased by Chihuahua's and real. No, not like dogs. I was very traumatic. So you guys are laughing, but I was trauma for me. But it was those experiences that that keep me humble. It's talking to the grandmother on the porch or talking to the people who don't vote who really informed of the decisions I make. And I think oftentimes we're always in so much of a hurry to move on to the next and get bigger and better when it's really the basics and the small beginnings that set the foundation for any skill that comes on top of it. The second lesson from governing or the ramp up phase is this idea that you don't know everything and that's okay. And that's really hard, especially in politics because for some reason people think that you are a fusion of Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad, everybody. And Tina C. Lee, John Hennessy, all the smart people in the world in one body and you have the answers to intractical problems like homelessness and water issues and poverty and crime and you and you alone have the answers and there's a lot of pressure to feel like you're the expert. But I realize that you're not knowing everything has been so freeing because open the door for me to connect with people who do have the answers. So it's been great to work on issues like poverty and realize that I have some staff for the experience and lived experience but there are some subject matter experts who've been doing this work in this community for 25 years who may not have the degrees or the pedigree but they know what they're talking about. And it's been so freeing to say you guys you know what? I don't know. I don't know. I know that someone knows, let's find this answer collectively. So don't feel pressure to know all the answers or have all the answers because part of, my opinion, entrepreneurship and iteration is not knowing what you're doing is going to work. It's the iteration and experimentation that leads to knowledge and knowledge is not already baked in. And then number two I realize that what I don't know, my users know, the community knows. The grandmothers who may not speak English that well know what it would take for their kids to go to school. The unemployed people know what skills they need. The employers know what skills the unemployed need that all these users around me have the answers to the questions. It's been so freeing to learn that I don't have to know everything. And the only thing I need to know is how to find answers and how to connect with people and how to humble myself and open myself so that other people are able to bring their expertise to the table. The third lesson from sort of this ramp up phase is the idea of having like personal angel investors, having people who invested in me early on. So a lot of my big campaign donors were actually people I met on this campus. Now it was a freshman. People I met at little development dinners or different events and people like that who have been so, so helpful and instrumental to this day. That finding early investors, angel investors, people with some experience and seasoning can help put your energy to use and bring some experience to it. It's been so great because we realize that what I like and experience they make up. And what they lack in energy I make up and it's the idea of trying new things together collectively. It's so humbling that every Friday I worked with a group of community leaders who have been doing work in my district for 30, 40, 50 years literally. And we set the table together and they tell me their experience, I tell them my ideas. We push back and forth in some messy process but usually we come up with really good community solutions. It's been very key about finding these early on people who believe in angel investors like a push or product. But in my case that could help me push policy, push ideas, push the system and their practice to really improve outcomes in my community. And but I had to pivot a year ago in terms of how I was approaching my work as a council member. I was reading to some first graders about Martha King around this time and we got to the part where Martha King was assassinated. And I'm not a psychologist by training so I was not equipped to prepare or prepare to talk to a six year old about death. So I try skip through the page really quickly and then a kid stopped me and said no Mr. Tub, my uncle was shot. And he said it so matter of fact, I thought his uncle had lived. And I said, oh I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope I'm glad he's okay. Now he's oh no he's dead. And then another kid racist has said my aunt got shot and I'm like, okay well I'm sorry. And then before I could stop almost every kid in that classroom had known somebody that had been shot at six years old. And I like that the teacher, the teacher looked at me. I'm not trying to cry in front of these kids because they look like everything's still like this. Just what happens is reality. The teacher's looking at me. I'm like this is your class. How are we going to do this? But it was in that moment I realized something because at Stanford I was really big on social entrepreneurship. I was like we got the idea of program, a gap, and we can solve it. So I literally by mine with the programs. It's like okay these kids have a lot of trauma. Let's put them in a nice mentorship program. It's several which I've started in my first year in office. I was like maybe their parents may have records. Let's put them in some back to work programs I started. And my mind was running but then I realized that for what they were going through programs that certainly weren't enough. The charity I was doing, the social entrepreneurship, the programs, the filmmaking gaps was important work. But it wasn't really enough to drive the change or make the impact I went to see in my community. And then I was reminded, not this all they have on the same day, it's like a couple months later. I'm thinking about this issue. And I was reminded of a story my mom had taught me growing up about a man that was on the road, on his way somewhere like thousands of years ago. He was on the dark or horse down this never road, the Jericho road and he was robbed, left on the side of the road to die. And then like a politician came by and saw the man on the side of the road and said you know what this man chose to be on the side of the road. We don't want his kind in our country anyway. They're going to bring guns and weapons and massive destruction. He deserves to be on the side of the road. That's his lot of life. And then I think my mom told me like a minister came by but he was late for church. So he said you know what this man's on the side of the road. I'm going to pray for him but I'm going to have to keep him moving. And then maybe a venture capitalist or a Stanford entrepreneurship student saw the kid on the side of the road and said that's an interesting problem. I'm going to think of an idea on my way to class. But let me put this in my eye for and come back to it later. But then finally a good Samaritan saw this man on the side of the road, got off his high horse, bound up his wounds, gave him some money, put him in the hotel and put him up. And that mentality was what was driving a lot of my service pursuits frankly. I was like I want to be that good Samaritan for stocked and I want to get stopped when I'm doing a 10 to the immediate need help people get well and on the way. But I recently just got back from a trip to Israel and I realized that the jail car road is actually structured or conducive for ambition that the road is very narrow and it makes it easy for someone to get jumped and ambushed. And that caused me to really think about how and all the social entrepreneurship stuff I was doing, the programs, the charity, how it was meeting and media needs. But now I didn't got system-wide solutions. That I was meeting the need and helping this one person. But there was thousands of kids in my city, 50,000 people I represent, 300,000 people in the city as a whole who really needed systematic solutions. And that charity or the good Samaritan impulse would not be enough to move the needle and stocking. So then I read mountains beyond mountains by Paul Farmer and excellent book and he had this idea of structural violence. And he talked about how in some communities like Stockton, other places in the world that the violence we see is actually structural that individuals aren't necessarily the cause for all the issues we see. But poor people aren't poor just because they want to be poor and kids are not doing well in schools just because they don't want to do well in schools and prisons are full of black and Latino men and black and Latino women just because these people have a gene in them to be criminal but it's actually been structured in that way. So I've really, really repositioned myself and spent the last year and a half in stock and thinking about how do I move from charity to justice, how do I move from solving and mediating these as an entrepreneur and government to really solving system-wide challenges. And the short answer is that so much work and so much more difficult than putting the kids in the mentorship program. It's so much work and so much more difficult than throwing money on scholarships. It's so much work and so much more difficult because it requires me not just to get off my horse and help the one kid get off the side of the road but to stay in that road and figure out the way to restructurize so it doesn't happen again and that takes a lot of time and energy. So I went spend just a couple minutes talking about the difference between charity and justice because whether you're in government or not as a citizen in this country you have a part to play and making sure that we change the structures so that your innovative solutions are able to scale in the way that actually gets to real life solutions. So I think the difference between charity and justice for me is that charity is like it's like bandage right? It's bandage, it's painkillers and justice is a surgery. For example, last month my two of my wisdom teeth decided to have a conversation on the freeway and one was just on literally on a nerve and jumping up and down and the other one was laughing and I was in so much intense pain and my dentists gave me some painkillers and some mouthwash and they worked perfectly so I don't feel the pain anymore but in two weeks I have to have surgery because eventually the pain is going to come back and I can keep taking the painkillers and keep doing the mouthwash and feel good in the moment but next year, 20 years from now the wisdom teeth still have to be taken out because I've done nothing to address the root cause which is that I have too many teeth in my big mouth. And I think that's the same way in terms of thinking about charity and justice that charity is what we do and it feels good and it's important but justice is the hard work of surgery of what it takes to move the country forward and then I also think that in terms of my own work that charity is me throwing resources at an issue and making the assumption that the problem is one of resources. If they had more of this, if they had more of that, if I give to them what I have, then that solves the problem. But justice is really about putting myself, my brain, my resources, my talent, my time in my body and on the line in a way until we really get out of solution and that's not sexy, that's not easy, that's incredibly difficult but that's the only way we as a society will progress in my humble opinion. And since I made that paradigm shift, I've seen some changes. We move from programs to really thinking through collective impact strategies for self-stop and we've realized that people are sick because there's no access to health clinics so now we're opening a health clinic. We realized that people were in poverty because there's nowhere for them to bank and save their money that there was nothing but predatory check cashing places that charged 20 to 25% interest on simple transactions. So we said, let's get the bank there and we realized our schools in there approved so we've been working on organizing around schools and we realized that the people we serve don't come in silos. They don't come, they don't operate in silos so we can operate in silos that they don't just need one thing that they need jobs and housing and safe streets and everything. Most of you guys had growing up as what people need and how do we work collectively to do it. And it's also been really humbling because it's taught myself also the city that we can't do this alone. That takes the nonprofit leaders, the community organizers, the clergy, the county, the school board and individual residents to really, really, really get at these justice based solutions. So I'm a little bit, not sad, it's a little bit worrying because the mission we're on is Stockton now went from a four to eight year election cycle to 20, 30 years. So I think I might be in Stockton for a while but I would say it's so much more fulfilling to be working towards something that doesn't just get at an immediate itch or immediate need that really gets at intractable long term systematic system changes in solution. It's ugly, messy work but so incredibly fulfilling because you finally feel like you're doing something so that you won't have to repeat it again in 30 or 40 years. But all that was the introduction. So what I really, really wanted to talk about, what I really, really wanted to talk about was I've been reading some articles about Silicon Valley lately. So I read the essay I think by Paul Graham that talked about how inequality was just a byproduct of progress. And it's okay that society is unequal, that wealth inequality is at the highest point it's been since the gilded age because we're making advancements. And then I read this article about what's wrong with Silicon Valley. And I was reading all these things that caused myself to think about wow, this is such a great opportunity to talk to the future of Silicon Valley because if I'm honest, my biggest fear is that I'm going to commit myself and my Stanford education to fixing these very difficult problems in community and stopped in, but that our society won't progress with it. I'm worried that I will continue to spend all my time and resources and energy really thinking through how do we make sure every kid career at grade level in third grade? How do you make sure every kid is in a high quality preschool? How do we hope parents learn the importance of reading to their children? How do we make sure that police community relationships are okay? How do you make sure everyone has access to fresh fruits and groceries? And I can do all that great work and stop them while society continues to get worse and worse. I'm extremely worried about my kid accessing me one day, like why dad in a time with all these technological advancements and all this good stuff, people forget how to live on Mars and on the moon and you guys are the black president, but people still have to go to the streets and tell people that black lives matter. I'm worried, I'm really frankly afraid about what happens when we let profit determine policy. I think we've seen some of that with the private prison industry where literally private prison corporations have helped write the country's criminal justice policies for the past 20 years. I'm worried that will spend all our time and all our energy and all our smart on making cool products, but really forgetting about people. And I'm not really talking about the people in this room because the people in this room and most people listening to podcasts, they're going to be a okay, you are going to be fine. It could be extreme inequality and you'll be at the top so everything will be fine for you and that seriously and that's okay. So I'm worried about all the people I represent or frankly 99% of the rest of the world. So if I could leave you with one challenge, it would be the carve out some space, carve out some time to use your entrepreneurial thought and leadership and brilliance to really solve some of these really intractable problems. I think it's crazy that we could create apps that scale 100x times but haven't yet figured out a way to educate people not to be racist. I think it's ridiculous that we have all these apps and we have space X and I'm going to get matched on the moon one day, hopefully. And all that happens, but yeah, we still have kids. We have a way to get kids to read that great, right? I find it insulting that we could figure out funding streams and new funding schemes and raise capital on all those things, but we can't figure out a school district funding policy in California that works for everyone that we have the answers to these other problems. But the real problems in terms of what type of society we want to live in in terms of what does it mean to be a moral nation, what does it mean to be a really great nation as President Obama says that we're not working on those issues with the same gusto as work on others. And that's not to say be a poor accountant like me because that's not going to be a serious either. But it is to say with your brains, knowledge, talent, skills and resources, there has to be a way that we could redefine traditional Silicon Valley terms. There has to be a way we could redefine what value is so that lives are as valuable as products. I don't see anyone can live in the country where 12 year old to mirror rice is murdered playing in a park. That's crazy to me. I don't, I'm confused as to how we can allow ourselves to work on these other issues and not pay enough attention to the issues of determining the quality of life for our kids and kids, kids and kids, kids, kids. We have hundreds of millions of people on Snapchat and yet we still have people who don't believe in climate change or are blocking our progress to change it that we have all these great products made by immigrants. But yeah, we're saying keep Syrian refugees out of the country. So I'm asking you as I prepare the clothes that we really need your help that you guys are so smart, so brilliant, so talented and the same people that create Google, Facebook, Instagram, Sun Microsystems. It could help us think about how do you make sure there's no poverty in America for example, or how do you make sure that the education system is equitable, or how do you make sure we at least provide the equality of opportunity because I refuse, I know people in Stockton who are so smart and so talented, I've met people who can make $10 last two weeks. I can't do that. You can probably go over the bridge with $5, you know? So I mean, we've have all these great people doing great things who don't yet have the same opportunities and I don't have the answers, but I do think the answers are in this room in this community and on the podcast and concert with the communities I represent now. So I prepare the clothes for question and answer. My junior year in college, I went on their freedom rights with original freedom writers and one extra question that really motivates my work that I went to leave with you all today. Well, two questions actually. The first one he said, I was born on August 4, 1961. Why was that day important? And I said, well, you were arrested. And then he said, well, on that day Barack Obama was born. And then he said, I had no idea that the choices I made that day as a 20 year old college student would pave the way so that 50 years later, a kid who couldn't get a cup of water at the counter will one day be president. And then he said, what are you prepared to do today? So like 50 years later, the world is a little better. So that's the first of two questions I'm going to leave with us. The first is, what are we prepared today in addition to making profits and money and products so that 50 years later, society is a little more equal. So that 50 years later, this room looks even more like what the rest of the country looks like. What are we prepared to do that? So like 50 years later, there's more opportunity for children up and down to income scale throughout the country and frankly the world. And then the second question really came from the article, What's Wrong with Silicon Valley? And he said, Silicon Valley is losing its soul. That in this mass commercialism, consumption and making billions of dollars every other day, that we're losing some of the things that make us human, make us human and make us society. And it reminded me of a scripture that I read this morning that said, what does it profit in man or a community or a valley to gain the whole world, have all the resources, all the talent, all the intellect, but then lose its soul. And with that I say thank you, time for Q&A. I don't have a question. Okay. You are now running for mayor. How different is it now running your campaign? How different is it than your first campaign? It poses new challenges. Because when I was running at first, it was cool to be 21 years old and do things that weren't clinical or professional or kind of quirky. It's not like he's cute, but now I'm like an old politician. It's been four years. I've been in the office for four years. So now there's a bit much higher expectation to kind of dot the eyes across the teeth. And also it's easy to run when you have no record because you just say what you're going to do. And now you have to go before the public and say for three years you've entrusted me with your votes, with your support. And this is what I've been able to accomplish. And for some people that's enough, and for some people you could do this, this, this, and this. So it's a little bit more challenging. Now you have a record to run on and you have to tell some people know and tell some people we can't do this right now and tell some people, well this is a great idea, but we don't have the resources yet because we just exit bankruptcy. And that makes people not like before everyone used to like me. And now like only half the people that used to like me like me. So it's a little more difficult. I'm good, man. How are you? So when I first looked at the whole series, I looked at the speaker and your name just stood right out. It's like, aren't you familiar with your name? No, it was the earring in my ear. I know it in the picture. Yeah. But the city council, you know, to the extent that I have knowledge on a political system is from watching the wire. And so my life is just like this. How do you keep yourself from, you know, being into the system and you know, keeping being part of this spiraling political system that Obama alluded to yesterday. Yeah. You know, like what are the expectations for yourself? So I'm working with Google. I'm going to ask you a favor. Can you repeat the question? Yeah. So the question was, I watched a wire. How do you keep yourself from being like the politicians on the wire, essentially, right? How do you keep yourself inoculated? No seriously, it was how you keep yourself inoculated from crazy political stuff, like not being part of the system but helping to change or reform the system. Yeah. Exactly. Well, actually I'm working with Google X now on a suit. And it's a joke. You could have laughed. No, it's a good question. So the thing is, the thing about politics is that it is dirty. But sometimes you have to like, no, go up and fight. That sometimes you have to make alliances and sometimes you have to compromise because that's some of the system works. So I think for me, I try to inoculate myself by being very true to the values I uphold. So when something comes across the desk or for a vote, I always think, okay, is this fair, is it equitable? Does it help the city? Like really basic, really basic to us. Like, is this going to harm people? Is this corrupt? Is this evil? That helps keeps me inoculate because some people don't have that moral compass, frankly. So that helps. And also, I think oftentimes people forget that before they're elected, they're a citizen. There's nothing special about you. I don't have special councilman blood. I'm a regular person who is elected. But oftentimes when you're elected, you're in meetings all the time with elected officials. And you go to events with elected officials. And if you don't go to events with elected officials, if you're in the house, they say, the councilman is here and you stand up and everyone claps for you. And that becomes, it becomes like a norm. Like you think that's who you are that you're the councilman. So I have to remind myself that no, my name is Michael. And if I lose tomorrow, if I decide to do something else, that's fine because I care about these issues. And right now politics is a way to address those issues. But 10 years from now, it might be something else. It'd be very open to that. And then I spend a lot of time with kids because kids don't care. If your socks, your mitts, your masks, they'll tell you, if you're wrinkled, they'll tell you, they're great. So I spend a lot of time in classrooms and with younger people to help kind of keep me focused on the issues. How do you think we can encourage social entrepreneurship when that involves taking risks and all the expert devices to minimize risk? Yeah, man, that's an excellent question. So the question was, how can we encourage social entrepreneurship and government when it's about taking risks? But you want to minimize risks so you can get reelected. It's an interesting incentive system. I don't know if there is a real straight answer for that, but to the best of my knowledge, I think in terms of how I think of it, it's really around sort of, what am I willing to take a risk for? Like some things I'm not going to take a risk on. I want to take a risk around helping ex-fellows get jobs because that's important to me. I might not take a bigger risk for some other issue that's not as core essential to me. And I think that's how I do it. So if I take a loss for this risk, I'm okay with it because I know this is an issue I'm passionate about. I care about. It's good for the community. And I think that, in part of it, it's also, I think it just has to be just a more infusion of that into government. Because I used to always ask the city manager at the time, why is government afraid of risk? And part of it's because government's the only thing that's really at scale that touches everybody. But even more importantly, the most vulnerable rely on government the most. So I can have this cool idea for water delivery. But if it doesn't work, that people are going to feel the most, or the most destitute, the most poor, that people that need the services the most. That makes it a little bit harder to take risks. So I tell my colleagues on counts, it's like, let's take smart risks in a way that won't unduly harm. The most vulnerable, but still allow us to innovate and become better at service delivery. Did I answer your question? Okay. Yeah, you talked a bit about pursuing justice in the body long term. So there's two things like establishing a bank or talking about making a health care facility. And talking about how you identify those things as real needs. Yeah. So the timer was super on me, so I was trying to make sure I was good. Part of it was that we established a coalition of organizations in the district who had similar interests around. We wanted to see this district get better. And then we did this huge need assessment over the summer, knocked on 800 doors. It came over the community needs assessment. The priorities were health care facility, bank and recreation activity for kids and education and safety. So they got the priorities from the community and then it was like, okay, these are the priorities. What can we do to address these concerns? And then it was like, okay, well, how do we get a bank here? Well, let's talk to the bank president and figure out what his interests are. We'll make him put a bank there. And then for the health clinic, we found that one of our partners had a health clinic that was dormant. Like literally a health clinic that was dormant for like seven years. And people were saying it's crazy. And people were saying any health care. And it's like, okay, well, why is the health clinic not open? Oh, no one really had an answer, which was a frustrating, but it was easy to get a solution. And they were like, well, we don't have anyone to run it. So let's talk to the local community medical clinics facility. And then things like that is really finding needs, but then also filling in the gaps, but kind of resources are already in the community. You talked a little bit to some of the problems that you see in society, such as mass incarceration or climate change. Do you think that other than the fact that maybe like you kind of alluded that ways of next generation of students seem to help tackle these problems? Do you think that there are other reasons other than maybe that our best brightest might not be working on these problems that could be perpetuating their existence? There's a variety. That's an excellent question. So the question was, for a lot of issues, besides the fact that oftentimes the critical of best and brightest are working on those issues, where are some of the other causes for these things to happen? I mean, a lot of it, in my opinion, is also profit driven. So if I'm making a lot of money by polluting and politicians need money to run for office, I'm going to donate to people who won't make me stop polluting. And it's more complicated with that, but I think for a lot of things, whether it's mass incarceration, climate change, immigration, almost every big issue, there's some underlying profit motive that's driving what I would call opposition that's anthropological to progress. And some people may dispute the science, although like the president said, 200 nations, majority of scientists don't. So this series is all about entrepreneurial leadership. What have you learned about leadership? That's my most old. Now I mean, you know what, your personal skills, what skills have you gained over this time? What skills have I gained over this time? And it was a point I had written down by forgot it, but I learned that consensus building is oftentimes more better. It's oftentimes better than competition. I think oftentimes, especially in politics, you want to be like the man and get decreed by learning to really make progress and get things done that's really about bringing the coalition of folks together, it's really consensus building. And I didn't realize that was a skill until I looked back at like even the things I did at Stanford from starting nonprofits, to learning student groups, all of it was finding people who were smarter than me and like, okay, can you help do this and why don't you do this and I do this and really working in teams and partnerships. So that's been a skill. I think the other skill has been really around empathy and listening. And I didn't realize that was a skill, so I did a D-School Fellowship. And then we're doing empathy interviews. And I was like, I'm pretty good at this, what I do, I listen to people, I hear their knees, I come over to the solution, I'm good at this empathy stuff. So that's been a skill. And then also I realized that I'm better at saying no, I thought I was, that if the dad is very clear, like we don't have money, we don't have money, no. And I'm really good at being the bad guy and I didn't think I had it in me. I'm probably too good at it now, I'm like, no, no resources. But that's a no, let's forget all the way one day, but today no. What's the most difficult decision you've had to make? Oh man. What's the most difficult decision I've had to make? It's a recent one. So there's a part of the city that's next to mine, it's the eastern side of Stockton. And there was a library that was open there that was shut down as part of bankruptcy. And people are calling for the library to be open. That means you're open to the library. The only thing is, the library's cost money. About half a million dollars a year to operate on an ongoing basis. And the big part of Stockton's bankruptcy was that oftentimes we made knee-jerk decisions about, okay, this feels good. Let's put this arena in. We need an arena. Let's do this. And we're not really thinking about how do you pay for it after the first five years. Like over the next 30 years, how do you pay for this library? So there's been a lot of community advocates saying, when you do this library open, you care about literacy, you care about this, you care about this. There are four you should open the library. And it's been difficult because I'm like, yeah, a library would be good. But in that part of town, given the resources we have in Stockton, it would also be good to have employment services. It would also be good to have healthcare services. It would also be good to have Wi-Fi internet. So while we find a solution that combines the best of all of these, but then there's some people are like, no, we want a library. So it's been really, it's an awesome election year, a library. No one hates libraries. Like everyone likes libraries, right? So it's kind of dumb to be arguing about, no, we can't open the library because the easier a political decision would be like, just open the library. But we some have found like a funding stream for it yet. And if we do find a funding stream, there's several city needs, at least need consideration for that fund. Those funds like our homeless is problem has increased over the past couple of years. There's infrastructure needs. There's all these other needs in addition to a library. So it's been difficult because I'm like, soup like these people. There are a lot of the community's English language learners, like a library would be such it benefit. It's been a tough decision. The debate we're still having. So earlier in your talk, you kind of highlighted the importance of the people that you surrounded yourself with kind of in your political career and also. You paid attention, okay? Well, I was curious now that the decisions that you make have far greater consequences. How do you make decisions about who to listen to, who to keep close, who to distance yourself from? Yeah, that's a good question. So how do you make decisions about who to listen to? So first, I think before you listen to anybody you have to have just in my head, just like, I call them non-negotiables or non-starters. So if it hurts people, if it's not fair, if it's not going to work, I can support it. And then on certain issues, I try to find people who aren't connected to the issue personally, who don't have a financial interest or a political interest, who are just concerned. And I listen to them. And then I listen to people who have political interests. Like, this is important to them. Or they have a financial interest. I listen to them. And then I listen to staff. And I put all that together in a secret sauce. And by the time it's time to vote, I have an answer. Usually it works because it's interesting that people see the world really different based on their position. So if there's something coming up that I'm financially benefit from, that needs to happen now. And that's one perspective. But for someone who may have not got the bid or doesn't qualify, they have a different perspective. And by putting all the perspectives together with some data and some common sense, you're able to, in my opinion, find. I think all the things I make are good. And I think most people would agree. But of course, you can't please everybody. What about the first one? What's that change? Personal decisions. Like what? Career choices. Career choices. So for careers. So sometimes I ask for help after I made a decision. Just so people feel involved in the decision. In terms of personal stuff, they work. Because people want to know. So that's part of it. I think I'll pray. But most of the time, I kind of know what I want to do. And I think oftentimes we're taught not to trust our gut and intuition. And I agree that shouldn't be the sole basis upon which you make decisions. But there's something viscerally there that's important to listen to in my experience. So that's what made me run for mayor. I was going to run for county supervisor. But then something just did not sit right. And I was like, hmm, let me investigate this. And then I thought about all the great things America do. And I thought about, okay, the stuff we do in the South start them. We could scale to the whole city. I'm going to run for mayor. And everyone's like, don't run for mayor. That's crazy. And I was like, yeah, it tells for mayor. So I think it's a mixture of listening to people you trust. But also just really listen to your gut because it usually has. If not the right answer and answer. So you talked about on your first campaign how a lot of people who were instrumental in that process were like, what are your best friends, your girlfriend, your family? Now that you're in another campaign, is it kind of those same people by your side involved as to the same extent? That's a great question. I hope they're listening because ever since I've been elected, not all of them, honestly, she's still helpful. But a lot of people have lives too so they're not as invested. So I was just talking to Cameron about this. I remember I used to call you every day. And now on this mayor campaign, I hardly even reach out to you because you're a med school. He's still very, very hopeful. It's been a new cast of characters in a way, but also the past three years has really been around building institutions. So it's not so dependent on individuals that I'm not depending on one person to do all my data needs or one person to do all my mail that I have built institutions and supporters so that my family doesn't have to walk every single week and then deal with me every single day and all that stuff that could just deal with me and then other people can help with the work part. So the cast of characters have changed for sure. It's a good question. That was probably my favorite today. So you have a great idea or policy that you want to put through in one of your colleagues is you know it's a great idea, you're under the pressure to share it. But one of your colleagues is being, it disappears with you and you're being very stubborn. What's your future? Oh, that's life. Okay, so how do I do my job every day? It's a question. I'm joking. I have great colleagues for the most part. So the thing is you don't need seven votes to get anything done. You don't need four. So I just try to count to four. And literally that's what I do. I'm like as long as I get the majority with me and then but sometimes if the person who's against it could be helpful or is persuasive or has like influence on the issue I try at least be with them to hear their concerns. Even though we may disagree on at least one see if I can address their concerns because maybe they see something I don't see. I'm so like why are you against this? Sometimes you get the truth, sometimes you get other stuff that's not quite the truth but it's instructive, it tells you how you shape the message around it so it gets done. That's your question? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I was just wondering what were the lessons from your time at Stanford as an undergrad that were most easily translated to your work as a social entrepreneur? Now I think my, what were the lessons from Stanford that were most transferable? Stanford is a really special place. I call it Disneyland in a way. No think about it. You're in this bubble. You have like the smartest professors in the world. You have the smartest group of 18 to 30 year olds in the world and you have unlimited resources. So it's just a place of great exploration, iteration and yes, yes, yes. So Stockton's a little bit different in some respects. But I think the lesson I learned in terms of thinking big and not being afraid to try and go has been helpful. I think the lessons around just relationship building that one of my best friends now who's been very helpful politically with someone I was on long shoe with in Cape Town for three months and being overseas and we just really hit it off. And things like that, you see the importance of the people you meet in the dish and in your dorm and in some way going to do something big whenever they choose to do. So having a relationship, a connection with them is so helpful whether you're in social entrepreneurship or just in life because just having access to smart people is a commodity. I'm sure you agreed that this was totally inspiring. Please join me in thanking Michael Taff. Thank you.
