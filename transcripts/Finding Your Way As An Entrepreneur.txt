 You are listening to the DFJ entrepreneurial thought leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Let's welcome Drew Halser. All right. Can you guys hear me okay? It's really a pleasure to be here. And surreal for me in a couple of different ways, but a big turning point on kind of my whole entrepreneurial adventure was actually about five years ago, maybe six years ago. There's this thing called Startup School, which is an held and notatorium, not too far from here. So it's been a pretty crazy journey since then that I hope to tell you guys a little bit. And so what I want to talk about is, first and foremost, a little bit of the Dropbox story, especially the early days and how we got started. And maybe thread through there some of the lessons we can draw from that. And when I was embarking on this journey, it was actually, I graduated with my undergrad, degree in computer science about six years ago. So it hasn't been that long, but it would have been awesome if someone sat me down and told me, what the journey would be like. So I'm trying to think of this in kind of those terms. What do I wish? Someone had told me, you know, 21, 22, just getting started because it was a pretty kind of, you know what you sort of, what I was thinking about the whole startup world was kind of like climbing mountain doom, right? You sort of, you don't know how tall it is, but there's a lot of fire and things exploding all around you, a lot of smoke and it's really steep. And you know, even if you know where you're going right now, things are going to get gnarly down the road. So if I can do anything that kind of demystifies some of the process too, I hope I can do that. So thanks again, a little bit about me. So I grew up as a little kid. I was programming computers. So I studied computer science and MIT. I've learned not to fight those kinds of battles, but, or at least it's the Stanford of the East, I guess you could call it. And that was really kind of the beginning. And one thing I realized there was, I had been programming for a while, so actually felt I had a pretty good handle on the building part of things. But then I was really fascinated by the world of business too. And throughout high school and college, I had worked at a bunch of different startups. And more than anything else, working at a startup was the most kind of informative experience for me, or the thing that prepared me best for this kind of whole journey. And that was a little counterintuitive because, especially if you go to competitive school, you grow up, and life is all about checking these boxes. First, you gotta get the right test scores. You gotta get the right GPA. You gotta do these different things to kind of be prepared and sort of look, be good enough to be admitted into a good school. And so if you kind of carry that logic forward, you imagine that the right path to startups would be something like, well, you know what got me here was checking out these boxes and thinking of all kinds of other boxes that I should check off before I'm like really ready to start a company. Among them, maybe I should get a bunch of graduate degrees, some are really good engineer, maybe I should go get an MBA, so I know about business. Maybe I should get work at a big company, like a big tech company, like Google, then maybe I should work at a medium company, then a small company, and then, you know, sometime in my 30s, 40s, 50s, I'll be prepared to start a company. And empirically, you know, there is no, I mean, one thing about this whole world is a bunch of different paths, success, but empirically, it's sort of surprising that so many of the companies kind of, you'd think about in the Hall of Fame, we're started by people who were basically had no idea what the hell they were doing either. And so if you have that feeling, you know, it should be of some comfort that, you know, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple, all these things are started by, you know, first or second time entrepreneurs who were really figuring it out along the way too. And so don't be too daunted if you don't have all the answers. But one important part of the Dropbox story began when one of my best friends, this guy named Adam, Adam Smith, he started a company called Zobney and he got funding from this group of people called Y Combinator. And back then they were still doing it in Boston as well as out here. And I was literally camped out in this living room while he was working on his company. And I had been working on a company, I had bootstrapped of all things in SAT prep companies, and starting sometime in 2004. And you know, like most first efforts, I had no idea what I was doing. In retrospect we did all kinds of things wrong. But the biggest thing that was illuminating was just so what happened with Adam was he got a little bit of funding in the beginning of the summer. At the end of the summer he moved out here. He moved out too well. He moved up to the city to San Francisco. And suddenly he was talking to all these people, you know, billionaires and famous entrepreneurs that I only read about. And the next thing I know I get this phone call from him, he was like, hey, we just got like $5 million from the node Kosovo. And I was like, oh my God. And Adam and I were fraternity brothers at MIT and he was actually my little brother. And so kind of a stark contrast between, you know, less than a year prior, probably my best memories with Adam were, you know, in our game room and our fraternity playing beer pong. Not exactly expecting to be wheelbarrowing away millions of dollars in cash. So I was like, well, all right, if Adam can do it I can too. And so never, never underestimate, never underestimate some of the baser motivations and how they can propel you forward or maybe as a more practical piece of advice. You know, there's some quote that you're in average of your five closest friends. So it can really help to be in a place where, you know, your closest friends are also interested in startups and you're all kind of pushing each other forward in a good-natured way, but there's also an undercurrent of competition that can really be helpful. So I saw the experience that I didn't went through with, with Zobney and Y Combinator. I was having sort of this, it helped me discover that I was kind of having this crisis where I couldn't put a name to it, but it was something like burnout where I'd been working on my SAT prop company for, you know, two or three years, part time, and while I was finishing up my degree. And I was like, I haven't even like asked myself like in the, in the best case scenario, what happens, and I'm sort of thinking, I'm like, well, best case scenario is like I'm kind of like king of SAT prep, and I kind of imagine like a little cardboard, like Burger King Crown or something. But I'm like, I'm not even really that excited about that, because like there's not really, I mean, I love standardized testing as much as any homonally balanced person can, but I'm like, this is probably not my calling. And so I was like, well, okay, I've spent so much time on this thing. I should really think carefully about what I do next, and I was like, okay, it should really come down to a few things. And one of them was, it had to be something that was deeply technical, because, you know, at heart, you know, since I was a little, you know, technology is what I really love. And I would love for whatever company I start to have technology as kind of the core source of its competitive advantage. That too is I wanted something that I could explain to normal people, you know, in a bar or a coffee shop or something, and have them vaguely know what I'm talking about. And so there are lots of interesting ideas that, you know, some elements of infrastructure software, enterprise software that kind of ruled that out, even though it's technically interesting. And third was, it had to be something that had a working business model, because actually this was kind of a height of Web 2.0 is all kind of back to eyeballs and these different things, but I didn't really understand how that works if, you know, can eventually get people to pay for your stuff for at least four people or however many were in there. So it was a good exercise for me, because then I was able to think long and hard about what I did next, and it was, I found myself in this really bizarre situation where the same way that like social or mobile or local startups are kind of the, the, the, the fat right now, in late 2006 or 2007, cloud storage or online storage startups were kind of the thing that is like the startup cliche, basically. And so you, you know, on tech runs, you'd have these roundups of like, okay, here are the next hundred online storage companies that have launched. And it was just kind of a joke. But at the same time, I had all these problems with this because I had this company and all of our crown jewels I had on this little thumb drive. And I was always like one stupid mistake away from disaster, right? I was, I would carry it like in my shorts and I'd like pull it out and the connector would be bent and I'd like pray that I could like bend it back softly but firmly enough so that I would keep working, you know, and I would, I mean, I mean, just all the things that, that people would do, I would still be emailing myself still off, I'd still be carrying this thing around my little leash. And it just drove me nuts and, and I, you know, I went through Michael Ahrington's articles and I tried all hundred of the things and I found something interesting where, you know, none of them really solved the problem for me. Even though there were a lot of them. And, and in particular, you had to get like one thing to, you know, one service that was like website, you could upload your stuff to and then you had to get another app that was like, that would sink things across your computers and you get another app to back up your computer. And I'm like, as we would later tell investors, I'm like, I mean, I can't really imagine Tom Cruise and Minority Report like logging into his Gmail to like pick up the attachment he sent himself that morning or like, you know, forgetting his thumb drive, right? He's just up over here and just your stuff falls around and it's a whole point like someone else takes care of it. And we had a glimpse of that at school and I'm sure you guys have something similar as we have this system called Athena. You're, you sit down at any of tens of thousands of computers across campus. All your stuff's in front of you. You know, you don't think about it and it's kind of, it's not a very, you know, it's not a consumer kind of typical environment. It's very kind of unique, focused and things like that. But still, you're not like sprinting back across campus to pick up, you know, your paper. You're not worried about backing it up because again, someone else is just taking care of it. Nobody had really built that for the rest of the world. And like, and this was pre, this was pre, you know, iPhone and iPad and all the amazing things that have happened the last five years. And it wasn't actually a very mainstream use case. I mean, people were not sinking things across like six Linux PCs, even then most people just had one computer. But anyway, this drove me nuts enough where the kind of last straw was, I was in Boston, South Station at the Chinatown Bus Terminal. And if any of you had the pleasure of riding the Chinatown bus, it costs like $10 or $15 and it takes you from Boston to New York and is famous for such things as like tipping over or things like that. So fortunately, that wasn't part of the story. And I got to New York, okay, but there was a problem, which is I had been making this, this mental checklist of like all these great things that I was going to get done because I had had, you know, four hours in front of me where nobody was going to bother me and here are all the great things I was going to accomplish. And I, you know, excitedly sit down and I open up my, I guess, think pad at the time. And I'm like, I get that feeling in the pit of my stomach, which I'm sure many of you have experienced at one time or another where it's like, start feeling around my pockets, you know. And I just get this vivid picture in my head of my thumb drive sitting on my desk at home. And that makes shit. You know, and then I'm like, okay, instead of getting all these wonderful things done, now I'm just going to think about what an idiot I am for the next four hours. But, it's all for 10 or 15 minutes, but then actually opened up the editor and started writing some code, having absolutely no idea what this turned into. But I'm like, I was so frustrated that nobody had really solved this problem. And so that was the kind of the beginning of it. And then through kind of an interesting chain of events I met my co-founder, Arash, I actually put up a, I put up a screencast of Dropbox on hacker news and Arash actually saw it and it turned out, one of the other things I did on this trip out to California five years ago, back in March 2007, was come out to meet a bunch of the Y-com-ainter founders and complain how I didn't have a co-founder. And it turned out, I met someone who was a mutual friend of mine and Arash's and he made an introduction to us. And we met up at the MIT Student Center and hung out for an hour or two and talked about my sequel and some other things and Dropbox. And they were like, yeah, of course we'll spend all of our waking hours together for the first year of the future. So kind of like getting married on the first date. But if anything, there's just an extraordinarily lucky break that it ended up working out and we ended up having all these complimentary skills and an integrate relationship. But I would recommend getting to know that's not the safe way to do it. But and that's the one probably most important decision you make is who your co-founder is. But anyway, so Arash and I applied to Y-combinator and we get in and we spend this blissful summer of doing nothing but waking up, writing code until the sun goes down and it comes up again. And then I would drive back and drop him off at his dorm at MIT and I'd race home and we'd do it again probably for 90 days straight. And so one of the great things about Y-combinator is it kind of plugs you in. It's sort of a start of boot camp where you encounter all these cast of characters that you meet out here where you hear talks. All the program is really these weekly dinners and you have talks from entrepreneurs and lawyers, investors, it's just all these different people. And they kind of start giving you context around what you need to know. And one of the most challenging things as a founder is really you discover very quickly that you know a lot about the technical founders. You know a lot about the engineering but there's always other things you got that you suddenly have to care about from sales to finance, to management, to strategy, like all these different things. One of the things I had done that was really valuable in college is I would, during the summer, I would go up onto the roof of our house and I'd just go on Amazon and I'd search for like sales and I'd look for like the highest rated book on that and like buy it and do the same thing for all of those different disciplines. And it actually was absolutely instrumental in helping me start to understand how all these things worked. And you know become a great salesperson by reading a book anymore than you become a great like a tourist or a basketball player by reading a book. But it can start to give you some sense of you know for people that are really great at this, what do they think about? And there's a really kind of important 80, 20 aspect of sort of just learning the basics about a given discipline that was really helpful for me. But anyway, so, Y Combinator, this is just amazing experience and we moved out of Boston to San Francisco. And just to give you kind of flavor of the kinds of things that you have to deal with when you're sort of trying to figure all this out is through another series of events we got introduced to this venture firm called Sequoia Capital. And it's the kind of thing where you know that you walk into the chalets and you know a couple of miles away from here and for someone who never really spent much time in California or never spent much time in the whole ecosystem, it's pretty daunting because you look and it's like okay there's like a picture of you know Steve Jobs. And there's a you know the original Google S1 or the stock certificates from the IPO and you're just like you know I don't really belong here. I'm just like some you know we're just a bunch a couple of you know a Rothschild dropped out of school. That's all the sort of cred but anyway so. But anyway there we are and we actually hit it off with the partner there and then through you know sort of muddle our way through and I'm desperately calling people at night asking for advice on fundraising different things through people I met and somehow we found ourselves in a situation where they decided to invest and I'm like oh my god this is amazing and yeah we were going through all this the process and you know it happened pretty quickly we showed up on a Friday with a handshake deal on Monday night so one business day turnaround which was pretty convenient and then then I had this new problem which was their finance people are emailing me like okay please send me your wiring instructions. I'm like wiring instructions like the only training I have in wiring instructions that I think I that happened in like James Bond movies and I'm like I'm pretty sure we only have like the my first business checking account from Bank of America that we set up in the Cambridgeside Gallery of Mall and I'm like so this might be tough. So Eroschen I go to the North Beach branch of the Bank of America and we're like all right well so you got the teller people and you got the leather seat people and we look at each other like it's probably a leather seat problem and we sit down and and the woman was really nice she's like oh can I you know how can I help you and I'm like is there a limit to how much a bank account can hold and she's like well what do you mean and like I was dressing shorts and hoodie and Eroschen's even even more disheveled and and I'm like well can it hold a million dollars and she's like yeah and so and I don't know if she thought like drugs or this kind of thing happens all the time out here but both sides very quickly stopped asking questions and we got our routing number and everything and went back but you know there's no like startup manual where you're like okay well here's how you know that works and you know so a lot of it is really you know even when you look that's something amazingly successful companies and having had a chance to meet a lot of those people so much of what makes startups great is really just kind of this iterative process of just having these random things happen to you or or having these ideas and just kind of figuring it out and and I talk about some of the kind of you know more humble beginnings because I think there's this this huge disservice that kind of the of a sort of Silicon Valley mythology and the things you read in magazines where it's like you know went from the moment he was sitting in his you know dorm room at Harvard Mark Zuckerberg sought to redefine the face of human communication and you know and and Google they were going to you know organize all the world's information and all these different things and you sort of sit there and you're like you're you're just trying to like write code and hope it compiles and you're like well I know I'm not quite like like that I'm not thinking about that I'm thinking about like we have $60 left and not checking account and I can't loan the company anymore money so anyway the point is like in fact you know Facebook it was number like like project number seven or eight that Mark happened to be hacking on and it just happened to sign up you know the whole like Harvard campus in a couple of weeks but and you know Google like they were they were rejected when they offered they wanted to sell the company for a million dollars to Yahoo and so the point is all these things start with much more modest ambitions and even the sort of the great entrepreneurs and the goal you know as you sort of reach each of these new milestones you're like okay the goal post move back and and and so your ambitions have become much much much much broader over time and this is kind of all this doesn't happen overnight so when you kind of look at it it talks at the beginning of how kind of daunting everything seen because it was like you know the little sort of corner of stuff that you know and this world of stuff that you don't you know often that that can be enough of a barrier to stop people from even getting started so just realize that this this you have to be systematic about how you learn all these things but you know it's all happens one day at a time and so then there were a couple other things that that were pretty instrumental in our you know in the early years of Dropbox and one of them was really figuring out distribution and I think that's something that people kind of people kind of underestimate the importance of that and it was especially interesting in our case because we made a couple of mistakes one was like we're like all right well we're launching this company and and we should probably get real and like hire PR people and advertising to all these different things and and but in SEO like and buy ad words and all this stuff and so we bought a lot of ad words and we spent a bunch of money in time on this and the results were just terrible you know it cost us like 500 or a thousand dollars to acquire a user that was going to pay us a hundred bucks and so very clear that that wasn't that wasn't going to work but we had actually done these more kind of guerrilla things which was inspired by reading the book guerrilla marketing which was actually really instrumental in thinking about this where we put this video of Dropbox on dig in 2007 sorry March 2008 about a year after we started and what we managed to do is we put all these little Easter eggs in it and because if you're familiar with the dig or with dig or Reddit they're kind of these classic internet communities and they have these little memes and things like that and it was just this dead pan demo of me talking over sort of a screen but the files are all named things and I'm like named after like chocolate rain which is like a YouTube sensation or it's like YouTube one of these viral videos back in the day and you know references to office space and Obama and XKCD and all these things but it's just me kind of dead pan narrating oh this is how Dropbox works and the thing just like and we put it we gave it kind of a little bit of a link bait title I think it was Google Drive Killer coming from MIT startup so go big and so the thing just like absolutely took off it hit the top of it hit the top of dig it was like 12,000 digs hundreds of thousands of people visited the drop what you get Dropbox dot com which is their first domain name it's a whole other story but anyway all these people visited the website and like our beta waiting list went from 5,000 to 75,000 people overnight which is because we you know we'd been ringing our hands about this kind of critical mouse problem and how do we get started and and just that one kind of kind of ghetto thing that we did like ended up working extremely well in fact nothing well you know it solved literally overnight our distribution problem or at least getting the getting started problem and the lesson there is not to make a video and put it on dig because that probably weren't very well anymore but the but really understand there were a couple of insights that came from that one is just another thing I learned from one of these books called Crossing the Casm is you have this technology adoption life cycle and you have these people who you know most people are not searching the internet for like cool things that they can download onto their computer or like want more buttons on their Blu-ray room right but there are some people who are like that and they call they're called early adopters and they kind of seek out technology for its own sake and any service or any company has some kind of early adopters whether it's a fashion or cars or in our cases really technology and it's kind of this tool or this utility and dig was just happened to be the kind of place where those people hung out and where those people would really take to something like this even though they couldn't download it yet and so understanding our early customer was really valuable there and that's kind of that's one way that we did that the other problem we discovered is that no one's really searching for what we're building no one was like waking up in the middle of the night being like oh my god I wish I didn't have to like email myself stuff or like carrying out a hum drive that's just like how your computer works I mean I wish I had washing machine like you put clothes in press a button they're clean they come out but like I'm not like waking up in the middle of the night being like man I really suck so there's like this washer thing there's a dryer and you have to like put one and wait and put it in the other and but then I'm just that's just like how it works and so it was from that angle it's like well it doesn't matter how many you can buy all the adwords in the in the world but if no one's searching for what you're making then you have a problem and so you have to find other ways of doing that and so the thing that really worked for us was first make a product that people really love to use and there's all kinds of things elements that go into the craftsmanship and all these little thousands of details that we had to sand down and all these things that some of the other companies didn't really get quite right from an engineering standpoint but then if you're able to do that then Dropbox actually happened to fall in this category of a sort of unusual category where it's also probably you don't even know you have and it actually works and you know unlike that Blu-ray player when you're just all you're trying to do is like watch Batman and you can't even plug in your TV that's people's kind of average experience with technology and so you know one way to conceptualize what makes a good product is you know good engineering is part of it good design is part of it but really it's one way I think about it is at least is maximizing the probability that someone shows up at the front door of you know your store or your website or or whatever it is and ends up with a solve problem and that's why things like Craigslist you know started in the 90s doesn't appear to have been updated since the 90s still by far the most successful you know website or most successful business of its kind because you know you show up at Craigslist.org and you leave with your concert tickets or your casual encounter or whatever you're looking for. Even though design isn't that great you know maybe it's not that hard of an engineering problem different things just unbelievably successful so anyway it starts with a good or well in my opinion it really starts with a great product and all the marketing or tricks in the world you know it's you know you're not going to push a rock uphill and then the second thing what we so once we understood that then it made it a lot easier for us to conceptualize this and so what we did instead were like okay well we have all these people who appear to really love Dropbox and the only reason we're like succeeding at all besides this sort of dig maneuver we didn't begin because they're telling their friends about it and so why don't we just like harness that and how can we give people tools to spread the word and so what we did was two things that drive the vast majority of all all of our traffic today or all of our synops which are one we made this recent incentive referral program where if I tell you about Dropbox you get some extra space and I get some extra space and we have this kind of currency to work with and people were just doing that kind of for its own sake where people weren't even using extra space they were just referring their friends because they're like it's like points right it's this whole what we'd now call kind of a gamification gamification mechanic even though we didn't I don't know if that even that word had been around back then but that's what it happened to be and then the other thing is we created this idea of shared folders where you know if I'm working on a project at work or I want to share these photos with my family then all these new all these users or just by using the product you get brought into the fold and there's this whole you know now it's there's this whole body of art and science on how to do that and how consumer internet companies grow and how viral growth works but anyway it was these things were instrumental to how we got started and so there's all kinds of things I could say about sort of the intervening years and this is sort of like the one of the frustrating things about giving a talk that's like a half hour it's like you have to admit it's like the montage where you know it's rocky is punching or whatever and suddenly like you know I don't know but you know then obviously but uh you know making a good product uh finding ways to get distribution and then the last thing I'll really touch on is uh is because I had the chance to ask Mike Moore it's like what really separates the rate companies from all the companies that are out there in technology and he's like one is he said hiring the best engineers and two the founders having a morbid fascination with the product and I'm not even going to try to do the whole well-shak sent thing but uh but those two things you know will carry a long way and then I'm sure he would add having a really big market uh and all the other things that that matter in a business but probably the the most amazing thing for me is is when it works out and um the thing that attracted me to this in the first place was really kind of never uh like having a high learning curve so that that parts taking care of is always you know you never you're never bored there's never things to uh to never shortage of things to worry about or that are new um but what's really exciting is now you know we have this we from the starting point we have the canvas we're painting on as we've gone from you know millions of users a couple of years ago to tens of millions of users um you know soon we have a very clear path the hundreds of millions of users um you know of all the people that have thought about kind of like building you know the internet file system or this this fabric that kind of connects all the world's devices and services and apps which you know we're actually the ones who get to build it and um and when you think about someone who builds things and uh and who studies computer science you're probably not going to go to the Super Bowl probably not going to be uh in Hollywood and movies but so for this this really is a Super Bowl and and when it works out and you actually sit down you you like um you look over someone's shoulder at a Starbucks and see a little blue box or um you add up you know this many you know millions of people are tens of millions of people or hundreds of millions of people time saving them like 10 minutes uh are making their life like 1% better or whatever suddenly it's like okay this is like lifetimes of pain that we're saving people every day and and then you know it's just this is the most like amazing path to actually you know if it all works out actually changing the world so uh I promised leaftime for Q&A so I guess we'll leave it at that how do you fend off competitors like now Google Drive and Sky Drive yeah the question is how do you fend off uh competitors especially when you know they're the largest internet companies in the world um we think about that from time to time uh you know the another sort of bias is you always kind of overestimate um competition not that that it should be underestimated but um for companies like ours uh and you think about any company that has gotten to sort of the plenty of stories of companies where you know they got a really great head start and then somehow uh things went south you know with a net escape or you know my space or the there's a bunch of companies that that you could say fallen as category and and when you talk to people in those companies there's a very clear trend which is uh that suicide is a much uh a much more common cause of death than homicide um meaning uh often the companies are getting built faster than ever like in the history of the world um and so along with that kind of hyper growth there are all these different cancers that you can get and so things are gonna go wrong you know my favorite analogy on this is was mark and recent these are like okay it's like trying to build like bake a cake in five minutes like no matter how good you are you kind of egg on the ceiling as we stuff on the walls you know you just pray when you pull the cake out maybe it's a little bit left side you kind of like squish it back um but like if you forget the eggs or you forget the sugar you can't like sprinkle them on later so um how do you figure out the stuff um or how do you figure out what what stuff you can't fix later um and i'll come back to the competition thing in a second sorry for such a tangent um and so often what happens at those companies that screw it up if you talk to people inside them they're like well we just we lost our focus or um we hired people that weren't as good and then the talented people we got in the beginning looked around they're like i'm tired of fixing this person's bugs or that they don't work as hard or all this stuff and life is short i'm a talented person i want to go find the place that has a lot of talented people so actually the point about hiring the very best people is something we spend a ton of time on um because that's again that's the that's the thing you can't sprinkle on later if you ever lose it's gone and then the other is really distraction um some pretty heartbreaking stories out there of of companies that were really promising but then um either started trying to do too too many things are you know uh friends there the the founder complaining that you know his board was trying to get him to chase all these deals with MTV and all these like shiny objects when he's like guys the site won't even load it like takes like 10 seconds for the web page to show up um you know and so the power of focus is there the focus is really powerful um and again you try to figure out those elements as you sort of start from like just coding to like designing and designing systems of code and algorithms to designing systems of people you know figuring out the things that other companies have learned about that along the way um and so while it's something that's really important to keep track of you know most of this if you actually look at all the data points it's really more often um the problems begin at home not because of some competition and and um so how the way so the way we'll respond to cover the way we are responding competition is actually very little is changing like nothing in our roadmap actually changed maybe there are a couple of things that got reordered but um you know we just focus on maximizing the number of happy drop-box users and figuring out problems more problems that people don't even know they have and solving them right so lots of we're never going to run out of examples that right um you know you look at your iPhone and you're like wow it says like a whatever megapixel camera and it takes HD video but then you know how do I see that on my Samsung TV you know or why is it that oh my god this is this I just discovered that I left my iPhone in a cab and now like all my newborn kids pictures are like gone forever like that's a problem you never had to worry about before and so we think a lot about what kinds of problems that people don't even know they have and and think about solving them and we think we're the only people that are really thinking about it this way and so um keeping our users happy and hiring the best people those are the two main things and you can screw up all kinds of other stuff if you get those to right how do you make good business decisions um I mean it's kind of a hard it's it's a hard question to answer I think you know I think it for so the the question is how do you make good business decisions and um it's kind of a hard question to provide a pithy answer like how do you play guitar well I mean there's a lot there's a bunch of things that go in it it's a it's a good question but I think it's really about prioritizing those things and and thinking about just that how do we get the best people into the company how do we build a great product how do we make our users really happy and then you know especially as a first time CEO how do you you have to like it was really helpful to me to just try to really research how all of these companies worked especially on the way out you know how do Google work how did and not just like internet company but how did Intel work how companies in the 70s work how what was the kind of yeah learn kind of get as many lenses on these different things from you know to view things from a sales lens or behavioral psychology lens or management lens all these different things and so bringing those different kinds of perspectives try giving giving yourself context around those things um and having a lot of tools to kind of deal with any business situation I think you know a one framework for for making good decisions and hiring great like great people into the company that can help you with that stuff um could you tell a little more about the um the investment process like uh the first time you got invested from Sequoia was it like an operator did they offer did you take what if they offered did you negotiate or was it very simple it's complicated I mean there's there's a lot of stuff that that's sort of one of these kind of a classic kind of pitfall of thing that you can spend a ton of time worrying about um and but I'm sure any venture capitalists if you could be the worst negotiator in the world but feel like god you know we're just getting so much traffic we just need money for servers like please and we have all these people who are using it we just need some money you know you're gonna get some pretty good venture capital investment if that's the problem you actually have and you know how do you do that you get traction um and so there's a whole body of knowledge on that that's actually pretty well spelled out venture hacks.com is the is where I learned and I think is probably the best uh best site out there that goes over them nuts and bolts of venture investment and a bunch of other interesting stuff. Through fantastic services for a lot of being uh addicted to grob ops for the last two years in ratscope uh used every day of my life and it's been fantastic uh the question that leads up to that my usage is that I'm maxed out on my 5gb and I'm the kind of person who doesn't like to play for services. That's that's a proof of the matter that I do that for Netflix for 799 and that's pretty much it and I try to feign the payment so what I do is I tell my mom to join my dad to join who don't know everything about technology you know I'm gonna be using drop-box data and just in there. So how do you how do you make this happen because I'm kind of for now I'm actually using Amazon Drive I'm using a little bit of Microsoft and I'm using uh grob box. How do you get people to pay money and make money for your business because valuations are all right but money needs to come out. Question is how do we actually convince um people to pay for what we're making um and there's all actually even a drop box as it is there's all kinds of ways that um that you can use the service with that actually paying for it um and then there are even things you can do um around you know using sort of putting this stuff on Amazon this stuff on Google this stuff on Dropbox and so on I mean our fundamental value proposition is that like we keep all of your stuff in one place um and you know we do a better job without than anybody else and and we have and you're free to not have to worry about all the stuff like you know what am I it's gonna work with my phone is gonna work with my computer you know we support all these different platforms um and provide a you what we hope is a uniformly great experience um and a lot of people just want a solve problem and rather than going to all that that trouble of sort of partitioning your stuff across all these different places um that's actually that's actually a point of Dropbox is to bring it all together and and they'd rather have that then $10 a month or $100 a year so fortunately that goes back to the um you know technology and option curve like some people just uh people just have different proclivities for like paying for things or not and so you know we just make sure that we're solving a problem that's big enough for people that um would rather pay for it than just uh then have to like deal with all these other hurdles uh yes the paid services are popular and uh I can't I can't make everybody else be quiet about that so I have to do too but can you tell us about a few things that cross the path that you guys decided not to go away it seems like an idea but then you essentially discard it though so the question is are the things that seemed um like a like a promising path that we decided not to do uh there are all kinds of great I mean that that that is almost the essence of what makes the job difficult is there's these thousands of of things that we could go do and and you know all these shiny objects and and usually most of the things we look back on and like that was a dead end um you know a lot of them we tried to get drop-ox sort of pre-installed on PCs and all these different things and do deals um very early on um and the problem was a sort of classic negotiation we had no leverage um so they were just going to push us around they made all these ridiculous demands and then kind of you know um it's like harpooning this whale and it's like taking you all over the place um uh and and uh and now it's a collective story we have a big audience and a brand and all these different things but um yeah I'll give you an example the the number one thing our our users more power users ask for which is the ability to watch multiple folders with your drop-ox and they're like why you guys can see it on vote box which is our vote you know we are sort of way of that we let uh our users vote on different features that they want and make requests um like you know why the hell haven't you guys let me why don't you let me watch multiple folders because you know I want to watch my documents I want to watch the you know map all these different things and um and the reason is well the initial reason was like we built something simple because we didn't have time to build something complicated so it was more technically complicated there's a lot of UI code it's all the different stuff that I would have had to go have I would have gone and had to have built um and we just didn't have time to build it because we want to get something out the door but then we realized there's this great benefit to the simplicity of the model where you know your drop-ox will look the same on your phone as it doesn't in your computer and um it's pretty easy to explain to people that uh you have this magic folder and anything you save in here saves everywhere um and all these different benefits and conversely uh you know you playing with the other products it's sort of like well welcome to this and please configure your folder mapping and and some people love that and that that's great um but most people are very very confused and and if you're already you know if you're already skeptical enough that here's this like new thing that you've never seen before and and now they're asking you about folder mappings and uh you know you don't spend your time worrying about folders and files and things like that then you're going to be pretty turned off um and you know we would see we would find when we did usability tests that people can even figure out how to install drop-ox to begin with like they would you know we brought five people in literally off the street and you know peep zero of five we we kept tally of all these things zero of five people even discovered that there was a tray icon or you know um a little menu bar icon and if you don't know that then you're going to have a lot of trouble getting back to your drop-ox folder and all kinds of other things you're not going to have a good experience and we're like wow okay zero percent all right because we get these emails we get these you know emails to feedback and i to our feedback alias and you know one would be like oh my god drop-ox is amazing i love it and the next one would be like i don't understand how you MIT nerds have you know i need a PhD in physics to like even understand this and they're just like with a diatribe and they're like one right after the app one right after the other um i really gots interesting and so uh so we brought people in off the street and then we started seeing all these things like okay that there's the people are clicking the screenshots in the tour because they think it's their computer people um well you know you laugh but it's actually our problem right we got this these are people that you know that would be that would be the you know paying us if they actually had a good experience um and i'm all kinds of they would they would click on internet explorer and it would obscure the download windows they know or they couldn't figure out where the download actually went i mean just we list of dozens and dozens and dozens of things and we just sanded them down we're just like okay well we're gonna get to thing number 71 today and and that and that now i've actually installed drop-ox you see this big bouncing green arrow whenever you you know what there's like hey this is the icon you have to click on to get to your drop-ox um and so uh kind of long answer to it's amazing um even just like 10% more friction might cut your audience in half and and it's exponential so uh we decided that it was just was not worth the complexity to build that and just wasn't worth the engineering trade-off in the back yeah i have a startup and we use drop-ox every day and i don't know if this is a reference or not but why did you go with an interface where if you remove the file you're not removing a copy that drives us crazy yeah so the question is why is it when you when someone moves something from a shared folder it moves it doesn't copy um and you know unfortunately that's just that we only have so much control over the underlying operating system or the finder or explorer on windows and that's just the way those things were designed and sort of the extra magic that gets sprinkled on that drop-ox does you know it just isn't aware of it and so we i mean there's probably some kinds of hacks that we could do to like if you move something out of a shared folder um warn you about it or you know maybe or do different schemes to make things read only or things like that but um yeah where it where where it's it's a problem and and that we should do something to make it better it's it's it's it's it's just a limitation of the of the it's just a constraint where we don't actually you know make the underlying operating system so we can only have so much control over certain aspects about behaves uh guy dark blue shirt sitting um so you got a really lucky buddy a co-founder what advice would you have for a co-founder so what particular skills do you have like looking back so question is what do you look for in a co-founder um and i think first and foremost it has to be someone where you just really really um respect their judgment um and and just sort of respect they just have absolute faith and trust in them as a as a person um doesn't mean they the you know it doesn't mean that they'll be good at everything uh in fact it's actually good if there's some complementarity uh and that there's some you know there'll be things that you're both interested in in in mine or osher's cases were both very passionate about the technology and the product design and and a very opinion about those things unfortunately our tastes are pretty similar on on that front um but then there's stuff where it completely diverges like i find all the whole business side of the house absolutely fascinating i think a lot about you know the the broader strategy of how do we end up you know we have the potential to be this really great company about how do we actually get there um given all the sort of yeah the minefield in the way um and and he does not carry he is not at all interested in any of that stuff um and he is happiest when he's like you know shaking the and like shaking an android phone and discovering that when you long hold it like this and then rotate it and then shake it like you know there's some bug and and you know he'll be responding to questions in the forums on his deathbed um and and and while i you know while while i'm capable of doing that like uh and i think it's important for everybody to do some element of that um you know i i can focus on other areas but i know that he's like got that under control and so um i think yeah it's really you and your you and your co-founder you know it's it's like you can't even really i mean you could have some kind of horrible situation where like someone gets kicked out are these different things but you know they say you know you can't divorce your investors and in most cases you can't really divorce your co-founder without pretty horrible things happening um and uh if i'm more important than that is really you know you're you and your co-founder are kind of the seed crystal for the early team that's going to assemble around you and then that you know the first ten people those first ten people are going to be the seed crystal for you know the next hundred and you know it keeps going out from there and um in general talented people are not going to like join people that are like less talented um but there's often a lot of pressure or you can sort of let the hiring bar go where you're like well you know we really need someone to solve this problem it's really hurting us that no one is like building this thing and so it is really that big a deal that this engineer kind of bomb that question or like it wasn't really that excited about drop box or isn't really going to work that hard you know you have to say no um and so it's really just kind of finding someone that that that matches you in that way how you do that is a much you know it's like how do you find you know a spouse it's like this it's it's it's it's it's it's it'll spend more time with your co-founder than your spouse back yeah how can we add somebody telling you that it's just a future not a company question is how do you respond to someone uh telling you that that you're what you're making is a is a feature or not a product uh so Steve Jobs was giving us a little bit of a hard time uh saying that saying that we were a feature and not a product when um when we didn't want to sell a company and so I mean you know everybody's got opinions this question that hiring great people is a very valuable aspect of their variety but how do you spot good? that's so the question is uh hiring hiring great people is an important aspect of building a great company but how do you spot great people um and uh it's actually a really good question because in some of some of these things are more intuitive than other things because like you know there uh for an engineer a good engineer can generally recognize another good engineer because you can sort of analyze our code and have all these technical discussions and you're both very kind of versed in the same thing but think about it it's like okay well if you don't play uh if you don't play guitar and you see someone playing like a Beatles song you're like oh my god like that's amazing and that's amazing this person's like playing music and I can't even get my like fingers on the strings um and you're like wow that's amazing you know and uh the same way that's someone who doesn't know anything about computers is like um you know I need a website for my you know my uh I don't know mortgage firm and you know my end I met this kid and he's typing all these symbols and he's like building this amazing website and and and wow um but then you after you meet more of these people then you then you meet Jimmy Hendrix and you're like okay you know um but you can't tell or you can sort of tell but like uh the point is by just having that one data point you know there's nothing to extrapolate from that rather than that oh man god this person knows so much about this area that I don't know anything about and um this is really important as uh is a really important subject because as a founder you know you might be a good engineer but you're not good at all this other stuff um and pretty much anybody who has made their background in some of their area like a business development person or finance person is gonna know uh a whole lot more about that than you um and so one interesting thing we did is uh while we screwed it up a few times we hired people that just didn't work out um it was a very painful experience uh two is uh we all a lot of our probably all of our early business people for the first couple of years we hired as consultants um which is kind of strange uh I don't it's hard to play it the other way so I don't know if it's a net good thing or a bad thing but um it worked well so that we sort of got versed we learned a lot in the process of kind of you know getting a brain dump from this person and then we also would talk to large numbers of of mark a lot of marketing people or a lot of finance people are a lot of business development people and over time you you get more and more context that's okay well it's really important in this field um and who's the best person I've ever met on this stuff and this is another area if you get sort of the best possible investors that you can then they'll have really great networks of you know talent to people in all these different fields and that's something where you can help lean on them to interview uh these candidates on your behalf but uh that is actually one of the harder things um about doing this is is you know how do you judge people who you have no context for what they do what do you as a CEO focus on on the daily basis um so questions what what as a CEO do I focus on on a daily basis um and it's you know another hard question to answer but it's sort of like well what is the highest leverage um use of my time is is one kind of framing you know okay how can uh yeah I think it's sort of gonna there's a very very long answer that question it's really you know how do we make sure we're doing the core things really really well like making sure we're hiring really good people making sure we're building a great product to make sure our users are happy and then there's a whole bunch of other things that you have to worry more or less about over time and then there's a lot then you build a team around you and then have to make sure that they're you know happy and effective and and you know all kind of rowing in the same direction um and then you know there's invariably fires that have to be put out and um and so it's uh it's actually a comb it's a surprisingly complicated question answer because many days you know especially when people make the transition from being an individual contributor to being a manager and so many days pass you're like oh my god what did I even get done today um I was just like talking and I was just like responding to email like uh this is the follow-up question is do I focus on culture like absolutely um you know Arash my co-founders even more opinionated about this stuff um you know one of my weaknesses most sort of double edged sword is I tend to be optimistic in general and so I'm always like optimistic about people so I'm like oh well you know or give people the benefit of the doubt um and he's he's the other way around so it's actually a good kind of counterbalance so how you deal with co-founder share and why Steve job picked your company other than your company what is say the first question first question how you deal with co-founder share co-founders share percentage oh share okay uh dividing question is why is to you job pick your company greater than your company? uh so I'll answer both or just both questions quickly so how do you you know divide up equity with your co-founder and again it's very nuanced subject uh without uh but people have written great things about that and it actually it's actually it's one of those things where you look it up on core or you search for things on google yet get get some very uh like knowledgeable responses and so I don't really have anything beyond that to add uh and then it would be honest sort of the basic things around you make sure it's subject to investing meaning that they get it over time so that if you have some disastrous situation you don't have to deal with that and the second question was why did Steve jobs pick our company over competitors um you know I think any company that does something interesting on the way up like it's all kinds of conversations like that that happened and um you know I think the the started the conversation with a compliment that we had a great product and um which just you know high praise I'll take it um and I presume it's I can't answer that on his behalf but presumably you know they just they've clearly understood that this is something important all right thanks a bunch we've got we've got a baseless video here you have you have been listening to the draper
