 You are listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. I get the honor of introducing Steve Wesley. As we've talked about before, the handout in the bio is up on the website for all of those of you out in the digital world. But just for those of you here in the audience, let me just remind you to tell you a little bit about him. It's such an honor to do this. He's a managing partner and founder of the Wesley Group. As you can see, well, actually you didn't put that logo up. That bears his name. It's a venture capital firm and I'm looking forward to hearing their strategy and all about that. But what's really cool about Steve, and I know a number of you've seen him speak on campus because sometimes he's here talking about his service, his public service. In fact, he's demonstrated that. He started in DC a long, long time ago in the federal government, but he was the controller. In other words, the chief fiscal officer of the state of California for four years. He ended up running for governor eventually just a few years ago. So he's had a really wonderful dual career, not only in Silicon Valley being an entrepreneur. He was the senior vice president of eBay for many years, but also with his service to the state as well as the federal government. So without much further ado, let's welcome back to campus because he has a bachelor's from Stanford as well as an NBA. Steve, thanks for coming today. So I'm delighted to be here. And it's time that I've spent a lot of time at Stanford. I was an undergraduate here. I came back and got my MBA here. I taught in the faculty at the graduate school of business for five years. And if you can believe it, it was actually a faculty advisor in Lagunaida for 19 years. If you've ever eaten in Lagunaida, you know what a deep commitment that represents to students. So what I'm going to try to do is something a little different. I'm going to share just a few personal stories before we start. Kind of about leadership and how I got to where I am now. And then I'm going to focus a little bit on clean technology because I really think that is the issue of the age and someone that affects every single person in this room and on the planet whether they're interested in it or not. By God, I'm going to tell you about it. And then we're going to throw it open. And I'm going to challenge you with some things I hope you will consider for your lives. And I'm going to ask you to ask any questions you want. People often say, man, I've got some tough questions for you. And I'm just here to tell you, folks, I've run for governor. There is no question. I have not handled. So this is a good chance to lay it all out there. I want to make this a little more personal and freewheeling than some of the other ones. Don't hesitate to stop me anytime you want. So it's a discussion as much as a lecture. I want to start out and tell you that I think in almost every family, there's kind of a story. And maybe it's even a little bit of a lore or a legend in that family that sort of frames who you are, whether it's an immigrant family coming here, overcoming hardships, someone who did something in your whole life. You kind of think, God, can I live up to that? And in our family, I had, through a whole series of circumstances, were Norwegian. And my father's side of the family went to Norway and my grandfather ran a sugar plantation in the Philippines. And that's where my father's side of the family grew up. When we were in War II broke out, we were very deeply Norwegian. The family spoke Norwegian at home even though they were in the Philippines, Nazis over ran much of Europe and including Norway. And so even though my two uncles were 17 and I think 18 and a half, and they could have said, boy, we're sitting out here in the sort of paradise out of harm's way, at least they thought that at the time, we don't buy that. We think we have an obligation to stand up to the greatest challenge of our time, maybe of the century, fascism, which appeared to be overrunning Europe. And so these two young kids got on a freighter across the Pacific, went to Canada and signed up to be fighter pilots because England, as you may recall, was the last sort of bastion left in Europe and it wasn't going very well. And there was literally no airport left in England that wasn't bombed out. They were taking every able-bodied male and saying, like it or not, we're teaching you to fly a plane and get up there and by the way, the odds aren't very good. You'll be coming back. And so I grew up hearing these stories about, especially my uncle, Eric. Some of you know this. If you flew for the United States Air Force, which my father did because he'd already moved here, you flew 20 missions and they brought you home because, frankly, it scared the shit out of you. People weren't the same. Just psychologically, 20 missions, you were fried. Well, in England it was a little different because you were all that was left of the Empire of Western Europe. So my uncle was not so lucky and he flew over 230 missions. He was arranging alcoholic by the end of it, was in jail frequently because the guys after doing this would come home if they got home, would go out on drinking benches and who would go get them out? Winston Churchill. Because they literally needed everybody they had left. If you had 15 guys that go up the next day, that was a hell of a lot better than 8 or 12. And so we literally go get these guys out of jail. Hence you may have heard the line at the end of the war where Winston Churchill said, never have so few men done so much to protect so many. And so this was kind of the story I grew up with and it kind of made me wonder as a kid going to public schools in Millow Park. I grew up about three miles from here. What I ever do anything big in my life, if I ever kind of had the call to stand up, what I'd be there. What I even know there was a call coming. And it's been a common theme in my life that I want to challenge you with. In one of the quick stories I won't delve on now but I ended up becoming a student body president here. And the big issue of the day was South Africa. It turned out who was one of the biggest investors in South Africa? Stanford University. And so we held what was one of the major protests in the world against Stanford University's investment in South Africa. And I was a student body president. And the administration said, your students, go away. What do you think about foreign policy? We're Stanford. We're, you know, one woman was on the Supreme Court. It was a heavy duty board of trustees. Your kids, 17, 18, 19 year olds, we don't care what you think. And it's one of those moments where we can either pack up and go away or not. And we did. The only thing students can do is always scares the pants on the university when I mention it. But when you run out of recourse, it gets to the issue of who's really in control. And you will face this issue again when you actually have children. Is you call a meeting in the association? Do we call the meeting in association? Anybody know what that is? It's where you call all the students. Everybody, the works, and lo and behold, they came. And we occupied the university building and closed down Stanford University. What happens next? Anybody know? Well, the media comes. Like lots, TV trucks, the works. And before you know it, there were demonstrations at Oxford and Cambridge and Berkeley. And long story short, Stanford eventually changed its investment policy in apartheid. And when Nelson Mandela was finally released from prison and then became president of South Africa, he stood up and he said apartheid would never have been brought to an end in South Africa. Had it not been for the international student and labor movement. And it was like, that thing I did. I didn't really even know it mattered. But it does. And I want to submit to you that there are a thousand little things you can do, some of which you will not even know at the time will make a difference. But they will. And the thrust of it is, you only have one life to spend. It will sound funny to you. It truly feels like I just graduated yesterday and yet unfortunately like 25 years has gone by. And so your life is going to go by like that. And I want to submit to you to remember two things. Whatever you decide to do with your life, you know what you decide is right for you. But make it something big. And second, don't take no for an answer. I want to really hammer that home because your whole life so far. If you're here. By virtue of being here, it's that you've largely done what they told you to do. I mean, you're not here because Thom said, do this show up at a certain time, do your papers and you didn't do it. You're here because you did it. God bless you. And you're at Stanford and you're about to graduate with a Stanford degree. But a certain part of the rest of your life is going to be about knowing when not to take no for an answer. I.E. because there's something you care about that's important. Which brings us to this. So I've been involved in clean tech. We've built from scratch in a little less than two years one of the bigger clean tech venture firms in the world, just a couple miles from here. What I want to share with you is we don't know if we're going to be successful. We think we are. We're managing over, it's moments, about $110 million. And I've got a lot of my money tied up. This thing better work. But I'll tell you, even if it doesn't, just being alive right now, doing what we're doing in clean tech, the stuff people are going to be talking about hundreds of years from now. They will be talking about, do you remember what it was like when everybody still drove an internal combustion car? Who was it who changed that? The answer is a bunch of Stanford students that are firm called Tesla. I'm going to be talking about that for a long time. I can tell you more about Tesla later. But I just want to give you a sense that this is a unique time in history. Not so different than being an artist in the Renaissance where there are so many extraordinary things going on. People were talking about it hundreds of years later. You've all seen this chart, it's tough with the lighting here. This is Al Gore in the back. You've heard the debates and people have said distinguished senators, Republican senators anyway. This global warming thing is a hoax, it's not happening. And I just want to show you that this is a 200,000 year timeline. And global warming in fact, tracks pretty darn closely to the amount of carbon we admit in the atmosphere. This isn't me saying this, this comes from ice samples. This is data, it is testable, and it is becoming increasingly known in the scientific world. The problem is huge, but what I want to leave you with is the rapidity with which it is getting worse is stunning. How many of you have been to China? Fantastic. If you've been to China, you grasp it immediately. I was just speaking at the Googleplex in Beijing. And on that very day in the paper, it said they'd just done latest studies and that literally merely living in the city of Beijing was the equivalent of smoking 52 cigarettes a day, two and a half packs. And that's for every man, woman, and kid. By the way, every 30 seconds a child is born in China with the respiratory illness. So this is a big problem. It is dramatic what is happening in terms of emissions in China just with which the sheer speed at which China has surpassed us. It is a stunning thing in human history. And it's not just China. When I was a kid, there were these 50 other countries, we call the emerging markets, economically or for the environment didn't much matter. Colombia, Egypt, Romania, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, today, virtually everyone of these economies is booming. By the way, did anybody know what the largest sector of the economy is in Colombia? Drugs? Good guess, but no. Coffee? Great guess? No. Oil. These are largely oil-based economies. And they're all drilling like crazy to supply Americans and Chinese who are determined to drive four and five thousand pound vehicles everywhere they go. That is the problem, and it's not just a U.S. problem, it's a global problem. Which leads us to this, who recognizes the city? The city I was born in, Los Angeles. Let me do a pause here. The same story. In the 1970s, California unilaterally passes catalytic converter legislation. And Detroit and all the automakers go to Washington and say this is absurd. How can one state have different standards for cars? We have 50 states. What are we supposed to have different, 50 different types of cars rolling off the assembly line? This is insane. But because Californians were bold and because California is so big, within a few years, every state had followed California. We forced Detroit's hand. Within a decade, every firm in the world had followed California. For the last 20 years, the air quality in this city was getting better, bullied for California. Until about three years ago, then the air quality began to get worse. Why? So, who thinks the air quality is going to be getting better? It's coming in LA. It's not. We are doing about, we had been doing about one coal-fired plant a year in the United States, essentially outlawed now. In China, they're doing one to two coal-fired plants or coming online every week. It's a big deal for all of you. And I don't want to pick on China and we're not in a real good position to lecture China because on average, every American uses about seven times more energy than the average person in China. You know what? The same thing we do. This is what we have to fix for. This was a global opportunity. And I'm just going to touch on this quickly. Good news is, China, well, the U.S. Congress is still dithering. He's already put out a $585 billion stimulus program, a huge piece of it dedicated to clean tech. European Union already weighing in with their clean tech stimulus and the Obama, a pretty big piece of clean tech. China is also doing some stunning things and just literally today it kind of helped make my speech. Obama stands up and says, I've seen the light. We are going to move from a standard 27.5 miles per gallon to 39 miles per gallon seven years, extraordinary. And the auto industry says, impossible. We can't do it. We have this, you know, overly liberal president. It's terrible. And by the way, it's going to cost consumers. Shameful what the Democrats are doing. China, quietly, is already at 35.8 miles per gallon. And they've just said they're going to mandate, they're going to be at 42 miles per gallon within 24 months. They've already leapfroged Obama. And by the way, who do you think is selling cars in China? The exact same people. They're selling them here. China is now a bigger market in the U.S. You think the automakers aren't going to meet Chinese standards? The only different one really is Cherry, which is an indigenous automaker. Otherwise, they're selling if you've been to China. Audi's and Buick's and Japanese cars. They're all going to go with IR standards. Why? Because the Chinese government knows it has a problem and it's stepping up to do the right thing. So China, I give a lot of credit to. This person I just want to pause a little bit on, it's Minister Panyue. And it's been one of the strongest voices in slowing down China's building of coal plants, moving to solar and alternatives. And it's the sort of person, although he's a little known here, is literally helping to have an impact on the future of the planet. Just a quick word on Norway, tiny country, but it's literally a quibbon said, we're going to make the entire country, entire country, carbon neutral by 2050. And then they came back and said, wait a minute, that's way too long. We'll do it 20 years earlier. What is a dynamic country? 98% of its energy coming from alternative non-carbon based fuels. This is a stunning thing. This is the sort of leadership we need more of here and I'm hoping some of you will be part of delivering. I just want to touch briefly a lot of people and said, what's the Obama administration really doing? Here it is, I don't want to dwell on it, but it's substantial. It's not as much as I'd like to see. It's 100x more than the Bush administration, but I'd submit to you, it may not be enough. Also I just want to pay a nod to capitalism here. Some of you are graduating, people always say, Steve, this is all well and good. I plan to be a leader someday. In the meantime, I'd like to make some money. Where do I go? I just want you to know that these are three areas I think are going to boom five years ago. You barely find somebody who knew what smart grid or AMI was. Green building materials sounded like something you would only have to think about if you were a facilities manager, you know, wearing overhalls in a building somewhere. I'm here to tell you this is a multi-hundred billion dollar industry. And third, this whole issue of energy, storage, cars, and batteries is stunning. Again, I want to give a nod to Stantth Tesla because a huge number of the engineers have done this came directly from here, some of which I talked to sat in this very classroom. And just pondering this, Detroit has taken tens of billions of dollars to develop zero emission vehicle. And the best thing to come up with is this thing called an EV1. And it could go about 70 mile range and it went so slowly you practically had to drive it in a bicycle lane. And a bunch of Stanford engineers at Tesla have developed a car that goes 220 mile range. That's big. And it goes zero to 60 faster than Ferrari, or Porsche. That's a big deal. And we're now not only selling roadsters, by the way, the second dealership in the world was just open right here, a mile from where we sit. We've developed a five-seater sedan. And this car is interesting because it only costs $49,000. But it's the first car that is available to the broader public. And by the way, the cost per mile of an internal combustion car is 50.5 cents. Not my number, it's the internal revenue service. The cost per mile operate this is three cents. And Detroit can't figure out or make one. Yesterday, I was dying to tell you all this. I couldn't do it till yesterday. The Diameter Corporation bought 10% of this company. And it said this will be the electric drivetrain for the future cars. So we've kind of very quickly moved from, and is this going to happen? Or is that silly car company in San Carlos, California, too? Diameter just got a doable search and said, this is the future of the auto industry. Right here in California. Again, Stanford. So I'll close here and then we'll throw it to your questions. I throw this to you. Folks, the long term health of the planet is at risk. There's some studies we're just looking at that showed the average temperature of the planet could be up as much as five degrees over the next 50 years. The impact on the water level of a five-year increase is stunning. Absolutely world-changing. The impact on the climate is amazing. Billions of dollars will be made. Billions will be lost. Whichever country comes first will be part of a tectonic shift. Countries will move up that get it. Countries will move down that get passed by that don't understand the wave of history. And the question I throw out to you is, what role will you play? So let me just throw this last slide out to you. In Spain, in the 15th century, on the bottom of every coin, just as a reminder, it's said knee-plus ultra. That's what you grew up with. It's a kid. Every coin you get you look at it and it says, if you live in Spain, there's no more beyond. Where are the edge? There's China in the Middle East, in Rome and Italy, and then there's Spain, and that's the end. It's in fall off, the edge. And all of a sudden Magellan asked her to gomma, Columbus, these people go out and come back and say, folks, you're not going to believe this. There's like, there's a whole new planet. Different people. It's tobacco. All these things. Gold. It's stunning. All this time we thought, just us. We were the end of human understanding. I would just submit to you. My entire life, we heard one thing. I used to work at the Department of Energy. It said there is no economic growth without using carbon-based fuels. You cut back on using oil. You run your economy into the ground. It's the end. The first time in human history over the last two years, California showed you need to continue economic growth like that and cut your, and cut your dependence on oil. Everything we heard, my entire life, turned out to be false. So I come here to challenge you. What new things are you going to discover? I don't care whether you're an engineer. You want to be in the policy world. What things will you make a difference at? What new world can you discover? How can you use the Stanford education to make a change that your kids will be growing up talking about for the rest of their lives? Thank you. So, the part I'm looking forward to, a time to ask any questions. You haven't, how long have a hard stop do we have? Oh, good God. Well, I may have some filler needed here. Questions, please. Sir. You say some nice things about China. China gets beat up because of human rights and so forth, but at least they're trying to do something about population control. I hear a lot of technical solutions to global warming, but I don't see it as people getting engaged with, say, the Catholic Church to modify their policies on birth control, things like that. So, the question is, you know, where is, say, the US government or policy being set for population control? That's obvious solution to global warming. Yeah. Sure. So, the question you asked is, boy, I've been a little hard on China, but one of the big underlying questions is population growth. And I think it's really a function of how quickly the population grows, which is growing too quickly for the planet to sustain, but it's also behavior. If you can modify behavior, get people the pollute less, we could accommodate more people. Now, despite my strong resume, I have relatively little influence over the pope. And I have to tell you, I apologize to the Catholics in the group, but I sort of cringe when the pope comes out with a frontal assault against birth control and other things, programs that affect AIDS and so on and so on. These are big issues we have to deal with them in slowing population growth is something that I think by almost any reasonable standard is something that not only improves our chance of survival on the planet that reduces the likelihood of war. I just want to digress for a moment. I was 12 and a half. My mom had gone to Stanford, brought me here. And I sort of grew up in the area that was nice and she kind of heard of Stanford and there was a speaker here. And the guy's name was Paul Erlich. And he wrote this book called The Population Bomb. And I'll tell you almost nobody talked about this issue. But once again, someone from Stanford wrote a book that essentially defined the modern environmental movement and simply put back in the early seven days and said, if this problem of population growth goes on as we think, it's going to have some calamitous impacts. Now, Erlich was badly beaten up and some of his projections were really overstated. Shame on him. But you know what? This wake up quality did was probably one of the most influential things a person could ever do. And this guy is still one of my all-time heroes. And from that day forward, it was like, I've got to go to this place, Stanford. And it was all because of that guy. If any of you get a chance to meet him, he is a historic figure. We'll be talking about in 100 years. Other questions? Sir? Yeah, it was interesting that China is the number one polluted. But when you look at the numbers, you're welcome to the perspective of the lab. Then, this year, I'm going to say in 100, we would say that China, as well as other should vote in companies, still should have their share of pollution on both the local countries, both the US. So my question here is, do you believe that developing countries would start in cryptocurrency as we vote in the same country? The answer is, the question is, boy, China may be the world's biggest polluter today, but aggregate historically, no one is going to catch the US for some time because we've been such profligate polluters for 50 or 100 years. And by the way, how do you get the developing world to say, why should we do a better job? And the average American is still creating seven times as much pollution. And the answer is, this is a classic Gordia knot. The knot you can't be entied. For my whole life, the Gordia knot was between the US and the Soviet Union. It was arms conflict in every country in the world. It didn't matter how small it was in South America or Africa. The US was wrestling with Russia, the Soviet Union. And they'd say, we're not going to do this because you won't, and we were stuck and wasted trillions of dollars and put the planet at the brink of extinction for close to 50 years. Each side saying they couldn't fix it because of the other side. We don't have as much time to break this knot. And I would just say to you, it's neither that the US is right and China is wrong or vice versa. Both parties are wrong. Historically, the US has been the worst. China has managed to surpass this. That's terrible news on both fronts. So I thought it was terrible when China said we're not going to agree to cut the US failed to even sign it. Folks, this is like my kids poking each other in the eye in the back seat. It's like two and three year olds. And major countries, neither the US or China can afford to do that. So fortunately, in my opinion, we elected Barack Obama and he's out pushing full bore to create serious reductions in carbon emissions. But as I've suggested to you, I think he needs to go faster. And the Chinese are doing a great job. It's increasing fuel efficiency of their vehicles. They're just getting out there and demanding it. Why? They don't have to worry about an entrenched auto industry lobbying against them. But they're doing a poor, so I give China full credit. They're doing a great job on autos, but they're doing a terrible job with coal and electric power production. Why? Because their economy is growing like that and they need the power. Good news is their government has ceded a ton of solar facilities. And in the next 12 months, this is something I deal with every day. These entrepreneurs have come in. Steve, we've got a great new solar technology. It's breakthrough. It's huge. It's like folks, it may be great technology, but do you know what China is doing? There's this glut of solar coming. Some from the US, too many venture capitalists like me funding solar companies, but a lot of government-funded programs from China, you're going to see a glut of solar on the market in the next year. That's the best news of humankind for a long time because it's going to drop the price through the floor. Poor time to be a solar entrepreneur because if you're an engineer, man, you have really got to make sure you're coming out of the shoots with 50, 60, 70 percent price increase. But I give China credit, they're trying to move quickly to reduce dependence on coal, but they've got to move a lot faster. So the punch line is, US has to do a lot more. China needs to do a lot more. Ironically, Western Europe is really paving the way. What I talked about with Norway, that to a certain extent, France, Germany, other Scandinavian countries, they are really the role model for sustainability and we need to be taking a play out of their book in terms of best practices. I hope, as we go to Copenhagen, that the momentum that Obama creates with some of the things that people like Minister Pan are doing in China will set a whole new tone for how quickly we can change this problem and get away from the sort of juvenile eye poking we've had for the last eight years. And everybody needs to do their part. Other questions? Sir, Steve, welcome to you. Tom Kostnick, there is a student letter organization here at Stanford in the Royal World Coal Energy Crossroads. So they have the question, if they haven't. So the question is, you mentioned Copenhagen. And here's your cross-erase, it's got students on the ground in Copenhagen, Stockholm, Singapore, Uganda, China, India, and here. And Bill and momentum, and they're trying to figure out what message they send to their business leaders, so that the business leaders send a message to the political leaders that are going to be in Copenhagen in November of time. Any advice on what we ought to say? We're going to see one voice, what are some of the things that you'd like us to play for those OLSDR? It's simple. I mean, they need to... It's hard to paraphrase, but maybe... But let me try. There's this international student group called student crossroads. Energy crossroads. Energy crossroads. There's lobbying business leaders around the world because it leads to most of the world, perhaps a little less in China, but certainly in Western or the capitalist countries, business leaders put huge, undue influence on their elected officials. I know this, I am one. And I used to be on the other side of the equation. What should they be saying? It's three things. Number one, move to the highest fuel efficiency standards possible, who has the highest fuel efficiency standards? Actually, Japan. The whole world ought to be mimicking Japan's auto standards. They've done the best job. Number two, we've got to have a worldwide mandate to get to at least 20% alternatives for electricity generation as soon as humanly possible, ideally within five years. That is a big, big deal. That'll put pressure on China, but I have utterly convinced China can get there. Number three, this issue of clean building materials is huge. The materials we build buildings with and the way we construct them think lighting as well as energy efficiency has an extraordinary impact on how much energy we use. You may have heard the terms gold, lead standard, platinum, lead standard. There needs to be universal or international standards on buildings. This is not complex stuff. They're already doing it here. They're already doing it in Europe. We need international standards as soon as we can get. And then overarching all of this is, in my opinion, a cap and trade program. And we're already doing it. And by the way, it's not that hard. I helped take this company public called eBay. And eBay is no different than a cap and trade. It's just an auction thing. Pierre developed it in the back room and his apartment. Any one of you could develop a cap and trade trading system. It's not that tough. California's past one. Again, Europe is a little ahead of us, but those are the keys. Let me just pause on this story again. The US tries to do something bold. Industry in our lobbying groups come out and hammer Congress and saying, you, we hope they'll let you. Senator Morgan, you are nothing until we found you and we watered you with money here at the American Petroleum Institute. And now you're doing it. We can't make cars through that energy efficient. And the joke is, they're already making cars that energy efficient in Japan. And they're already doing it in China. And China is a bigger market than the US. And they're buying the same cars in China that we buy here again. It's a completely fallacious argument, but our elected officials do us a huge disservice. They would urge every one of you, especially the organization, go out and hammer our elected officials. Follow the best practices of Japan and Western Europe. We owe people in those two parts of the world a huge debt of gratitude. Sir. You mentioned both private sector solutions to environmental problems and government regulations that affect that. I was just wondering which do you think is more important and most of the interaction between those two that needs to occur, you know, for a viable solution. So which has the most impact private sector solutions versus government solutions? Yeah, I'm really like what's the interaction between regulations and startup companies and things like that that you see. So this is a great question. This is something I would love to get some of the fine minds in this room to work on as what is the interconnection between, you know, the people of Silicon Valley, the entrepreneurs and policymakers. And the answer is almost done. And it's so funny because I've been in these meetings and by and large, these people almost don't speak different languages. If you're a government regulator, your whole life is, they're no incentives to doing well and you kind of want to do good and you've probably never worked in the private sector. And it's very hard to understand how these people work except you know they get paid a hell of a lot more than you do and in some cases, it's an obscenely lot more than you do. And if you're a private sector entrepreneur, you're wondering what's wrong with these government officials, they're not working very quickly. And it's kind of a complete, it's as if they were not speaking different languages or they were stuck in different cultures when in fact they are. It's one of the things we're trying to work out now in California. Frankly, it's been a leader. One of the things I've tried to do in my life is work in both government and in the private sector. It's very funny. I remember I went to business school at Stanford. At the time I'd been the treasurer of the state Democratic Party. And I'd go to political events or I'd go to business school events and say, so sleazy, he's in politics. Oh, terrible. And I'd go to Democratic Party events and say, so sleazy, he's getting an MBA. He's a business guy. And both worlds think the other is the antithesis of ethical behavior. In fact, they were both right. But what I'm arguing for is really a greater understanding in that more of you will spend your time going back and forth. Here's some good news. Obama is just appointed a very good guy, Dr. Steven Chu, former Stanford faculty member to be head of the Department of Energy. And he took one great guy, again reaching out immediately for this job of allocating. This is the world's best job, by the way. $47 billion into clean tech projects, solar companies, biofuels, technologies of the future. And they said, well, who's going to figure out who to give the money to? And to their credit, they didn't say, well, let's find a GS-15 who's been working in the forest all building for 32 years. They said, let's get the most senior person we can out of McKinsey in San Francisco. His name is Matt Rogers. He in turn has five boxes under him in the first three he's hired. They've all been investment professionals from Silicon Valley. So usually isn't the way government works, but this is great news. That for the first time, the president realizes there's a problem, which is recession. You don't want to just start making a lot of new cars or airplanes that will pollute things more. You want to have a green stimulus program. So they're going to put it to work and they've actually brought investment professionals in from Silicon Valley to help manage the money. That's caused for hope. That's sort of exciting. I hope the Obama administration will be able to do more. Let me do a couple of more questions, sir. Given the harsh economic times and if the impetus is going to help with the growing deficit, what do you really see clean tech role in helping to improve the economy? I guess a second part of that question would be, let's say your governor's role was successful and you're in the government's mentioned right now. What would you be doing to implement clean tech from the government's staff? Wow. I was hoping for some tougher questions, but let me start with that for now. Let's start with the first one. What is clean tech role in helping to get the economy to be? Well, historically, every five or ten years, entrepreneurs, which is you, primarily young people, come up with some new breakthrough. iPod, iPhones, eBay, Google, Twitter, and it ignites some huge new need, guitar hero, even as big as guitar hero. And all of a sudden, sales go through the roof and employees people and in theory, it makes people's lives better. We're seeing that now with clean tech. And I'll tell you just of the things I talked about, zero emission vehicles, this is a big deal. So to your point, what is this going to do for the economy? We're in a recession. One of the things that jump starts you out of a recession, I mean part of it is consumer psychology, but part of it are products that people have to have that drive the economy. This Tesla Model S, not the sports car, which is historic that goes zero to 60 like a Ferrari, but this five-seater that's cheaper, we released that car, I think five and a half, six weeks ago in Los Angeles and we've taken over a thousand orders in five weeks. So we're taking orders for this, then GM's taking orders for Saturn. So the point is, I believe that the clean tech industry is likely to help provide the jump start that will lift America and hopefully the rest of the world out of recession. You saw today, or if you follow this as closely as I do, but we had the first big IPO. We've had a 10 months, longest stretch in 50 years since we had a big IPO and it was a billion dollar company. I love this joke. The company is called Solar Wind. Has nothing to do with clean tech. Nothing to do with solar, nothing to do with wind. It's okay, it's a software company from Austin. People at UT beat you to the punch, but this is going to reignite the economy. I think the next two or three IPOs, big ones we see are likely to be clean tech companies. By the way, Tesla and a firm called Silver Spring since Smart Grid Space and will be block Buster IPOs. Clean tech will help lift the company country out of recession. By the way, one of the things you should always ask yourself is, where are the most IPOs happening? And for my entire life, your entire life, I'm just about the oldest person here with a few exceptions. Where are the most IPOs? Are we awake here or folks? US? Every year? Huge. California leading the United States, leading the pack. And California leading the US, it's all happening right here at about a third of it by Stanford Grants. Amazing. But the question you should always ask, by the way, always ask in life is, who's number two? Who's buying me? And the answer now is China. China is really closing in on the United States, especially in clean tech IPOs. It's stunning. And by the way, for my whole life, you talk about doing investing in China. You say, well, big market, but there are all these transparency issues. And we'd say, we need these laws and these accounting standards. And the Chinese would buy in large to say, we don't want to have the US dictate this stuff to us. We're going to do it our own way. And the US can go jump in the leg. But regardless of what the US wanted to dictate, and regardless of what the Chinese government thought was appropriate, there was a powerful force that exceeded all else. I guess? Please, work with me here, folks. Take a guess. It's the force of human greed. People want to make money. Chinese watch TV and the internet like everybody else. They're looking at Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos and Sergey and Larry and saying, I want to take a company public. If you want to take a company public, you've got to have audited financials. The hottest commodity in the world right now, I think, is a Chinese speaking CFO. If you speak Chinese and you want to Stanford or UCLA or Berkeley Business School, you've won. It's like the jackpot. You're dying to get you right now to take a company public because that is how you can make money because the Chinese government allows you. The Chinese government has decided it's a good thing to have companies go public. So all of a sudden, it's changed. Arfer is thinking about how quickly we can open an office in Beijing. And it's a fascinating thing. I'll tell you one parallel story to go with it. Almost every week. We'll see some, you know, a ton of entrepreneurs, Americans and immigrants from everywhere, and some from China. And whenever we see a deal from China. It's almost always growing quickly, just like the other deals we see. But the entrepreneur will say, and it's profitable. I'll say your company's profitable. You have a startup, it's profitable. I've just seen 90 entrepreneurs. None of them have profitable companies. And they'll say, what do you mean? We come from China. There's no safety net here. We have no choice but to be profitable. So we are. And that's the way it is. That's the expectation. The human beings measure up to the expectation. And I just want to suggest to you that there's really no reason in the world that the 90 entrepreneurs I see from the US of every striping color don't have profitable business plans. We've just gotten, I believe, a little softer. eBay, company I helped take public. 14 and a half years old now has never had an unprofitable quarter or an unprofitable month. Just not the way we ran it. So I just throw that out to you about expectations and the way you've always been told it had to be, always look over to your shoulder to make sure someone's not doing it better or different. Because if they are, you better figure out how to be. And in the old days, you may have 100, 200 years to figure it out. Now with the internet, YouTube, Twitter, you may have about a week to figure it out. So stay tuned. Sir. Thanks, Dave. I've been serving clean check now for several months. And I was interested to start hearing that the debate for our nuclear power is starting to air again. I was just wondering if you or your firm have any public opinion on this. So the question is, what about nuclear power? It's starting to come up again. And I am neither for nor against nuclear power. I just want to explain something very key. And if you go to business school, you spend a lot of time on this. People say nuclear power is so cheap. It was the phrase the branding with nuclear power was, it's so too cheap to meet her. We'd almost give her away. And the rub is, we have this thing called environmental standards. And it takes about 10 years to build, to permit and build a nuclear facility. And there's this thing called the cost of capital. And it's billions of dollars to build a nuclear facility. And the cost of capital to build a nuclear facility is a huge, huge, huge amount. So I just want to be very specific. Nuclear is really, really expensive and the payback is not for decades. Point two, while the operating of a nuclear plant is pretty clean, we still have not figured out to do what to do with the fishable material. And I love explaining this to engineers. The engineers have sort of figured it out. There's no panacea solution. But you can take the stuff and you can put it in deep salt mines, crevices in the earth that are seismically stable. So get these three things right. It's got to be deep underground. And you can't be any people nearby. So far away places and then North Quakes. And that's pretty much the answer. And there's only one place we found in the United States to do this. Anybody know the answer? Who said it? Yeah? Yucca, Yucca mountain in Nevada. In every four years, this marvelous event happens. Anybody know what it is? It's called the Nevada presidential primary. And after all the brilliant engineers have done the work and say, I figured it out, I know this works. Here's where we're going to put it. It's miles down. It's seismically stable. And the Nevada primary has come around. And one candidate after other stands up and says, if there's one thing I believe into the core of my being, there shall never be nuclear materials buried in your beautiful state. If any of you've seen Nevada, I'm sorry. So I'm teasing. I'm teasing. So to come back to your point, look, we already have a lot of nuclear in Japan. We have a lot in France. We've got some in Russia. You will see it start to come back. Some places, probably in the South Florida and so on. But until you figure out what to do with the feasible, feasible materials, it's still tough. And it's still relatively speaking, pretty expensive. So it's just a tough time figuring those things out. Again, hopefully some of you will come up with answers. Let me do one more question and then I'll provide a close here. Sir. In your opinion, what alternative are these solutions you think has the best potential to replace oil and food? So in my opinion, what solutions have the best potential to replace oil and coal? So first, it's important to realize these are two pretty different kettles of fish. I think on the coal side, you're talking about electricity generation. And I think really, and you've heard a lot about this, solar and wind are both stunning. The neat thing about solar and wind is they tend to fit in different parts of the world. So the warm southwestern U.S. great for solar, Midwest, Northern, very cold places, North Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, perfect for wind. You will see a lot of that. Now we're still away from doing it in big volumes that we need. But again, the good news is, because of the free floor capital and a lot of smart people like you, the cost of solar is going through the floor. It's going to have this year. And if it has again, let me put it in real terms, I put a marketing hat on today. You want to sell solar, you roll in, and the husband and wife look at you and you say, it's a seven year payback. By the end of this year, it's going to be three and a half. Psychologically, that's huge. If you get below two, you're going to see solar all over. The other big advantage of solar, I just want to pause on this. Because there's a revolution. I like revolutions as you can tell. You get a revolution in eBay, a revolution in clean tech, but there's also a revolution in computing. And the old days when I grew up was all about big mainframes. Now there's a revolution of distributed PCs and technology. Well, there's a revolution in distributed power. Why? Because you can't have a grid that goes everywhere. When you build a nuclear plant, how many of you would like a nuclear plant on your block? All right. Nobody. Most people don't want a nuclear plant with it. 50 miles. So you build these things in the middle of nowhere and then you have to wheel the power in. I think the future is going to be distributed power. I think you're going to see a ton of people like me, with solar on the roofs or windmills on the roof. Remember the distributed part of this equation in getting the power near you. And by the way, for something like Tesla, to be able to say, you'll never have to pay a penny for gasoline again ever. Or if you put the solar panels on your garage for electricity either, you'll be self-contained. Now let's move over to the gas part, my hope. And I will tell you right now, you're going to see a move from where we are today toward electric cars that will be faster than anything you dream. Everybody is talking now. I said, oh, I got this. This Prius and hybrids are great. Folks, it just doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense. They have a car with a duplicative motor, two motors and every one of these things. And a gas tank and batteries. That's redundant. And I think we're going to leapfrog this hybrid technology very, very quickly. Why did we go to this middle step? Well, batteries just weren't good enough. The batteries were getting better all the time. So you will see a ton of electric cars. There will still be a lot of biofuels. And I think the answer for the world's remaining biofuels needs. Interestingly enough, you know, three, four years ago, if you were to say ethanol. And now that's not so good, can still pollute so that it competes with food stuff. Now everybody talks about cellulosic. So using sawgrass and those things, that's a lot better. But ultimately, these things are still producing a fuel that pollutes. And what I will suggest to you is there's this odd science of what, when I work for the Department of Energy, they call it sin fuels, where you can biologically engineer inputs like cane to have the exact same molecular structure as carbon-based fuels only without the pollution. That is the holy grail. So I think you'll see more and more sin fuel companies. There's a firm called Amorous and Emoryville. Does it? And the leading firms are right here. So I want to stop here and leave you with this thought. When I graduated from school, from here, there's one thing we're all thinking, which was something along the lines of, oh my God, I've got these huge student loans, get any job you can and try to pay these things off. And by and large, you're going to start at the bottom wrong. Because we're all 22. And when you're 22, the silly place you could start. There were no 22-year-olds running companies when I got out. And there wasn't a VC industry to speak of. There were no 22-year-olds starting companies. And I'm here to tell you that some of the biggest and most enduring companies in the world are started by 22-year-olds now. Larry, Sergei, the YouTube guys, Pyramiddi Arlen, he started eBay, the Twitter guys, it's one story after another. There are no 50-year-olds starting these companies. You not only have an opportunity, it never existed before. You have an advantage. We're living in a technology century. You, by definition, understand that better than people my age. So how are you going to use that advantage to change the world? I hope you'll do it in a way that's big. Thank you.
