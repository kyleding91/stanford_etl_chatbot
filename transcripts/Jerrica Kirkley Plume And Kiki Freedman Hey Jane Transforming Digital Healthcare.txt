 Who you are defines how you build. This is the OddPattern thought leader series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. Hello everyone. Good afternoon. I am your host for today. I'm Melissa Valentine. I'm an associate professor of management science and engineering here at Stanford. My own research is how technology changes people's jobs. That's certainly true for entrepreneurs and certainly true for our founders today who are both founders of digital digital health companies. There is also special significance to the themes for today as you'll see. Both Kiki and Jerika run companies that provide services for communities who have been impacted by policy change. Let me say specifically plume and ha Jane are both reaching people whose lives have been dramatically affected by changes in public policy at both the federal and state levels. So that would include the overturning of Roe v Wade and state laws that restrict gender affirming healthcare for transgender people. So there's special significance to these themes and the staff at ETL the producers had sort of a visionary idea to use this as an opportunity to think about how entrepreneurship can be a vehicle for change. How entrepreneurship can be a way of reacting to public policy and how entrepreneurship can be a vehicle for sort of influencing and driving driving social change. That's a really interesting and provocative and really important topic. I think it's great that ETL wanted to kind of host this conversation and really honored to be a part of it. That's the significance of today and with that, let me tell you a little bit more about our founders who are very lucky to have today. So let me first introduce you to Dr. Jerika Kirkley. So Dr. Kirkley is the chief medical officer and founder of plume. It's a health care center of excellence. It is dedicated to providing care for the transgender community. It provides gender affirming medical care at the convenience of a smartphone. Jerika has cared for thousands of gender diverse individuals and has also been the recipient of gender affirming care as a patient and trans woman herself. Her mission is to transform health care for all to make it accessible, affordable and aligned with the needs of individuals to help folks live happy and healthy lives. And I know friends who have personally really benefited from Dr. Kirkley's work. So very excited to have you here today. The second person who I'm excited to introduce is Kiki Friedman. So Kiki is the CEO and co founder of Hagen, which is a virtual clinic that offers telemedicine abortion care, which she founded when she was a student at Harvard Business School. Before she founded Hagen, Kiki was an early employee at Uber, where her roles included launching Uber in Kenya, spearheading key operational initiatives on the company's PRO team and leading strategy and expansion for Uber Eats in the Middle East and Africa region. With that, I'm going to now open with some questions for our founders. So Jerika and Kiki, now that we know a little bit about you and your companies, I'm going to start with this question. I'd like to talk about your lives and your background and how that led you to this moment. So the question is, how has your lived experience shaped you as entrepreneurs and influence the way you think about the communities your companies serve? Let's start with you Jerika. Thanks Melissa and really excited to be here alongside both of you and all of you listening and really an honor. Wow, you know, I think about that question. It's kind of like it's just so deeply integrated into everything I've done. But if I go back to the days, I was thinking about be even going into healthcare, becoming a doctor for me, that was through a lens of social justice. I've just always idealized medicine as a vehicle to do that and maybe naively so back in those early days. But you know, what's cool is I've found a path to do that. And so that's what got me into healthcare. And I saw a lot of communities around me that were drastically underserved and wanted to find ways to provide high quality healthcare to those communities. And when I was in my family medicine residency, so I'm not family physician by training. And I had the opportunity to work with the faculty mentor and build out a curriculum basically dedicated to LGBTQ health care and this family medicine residency. And a big part of that was developing a protocol or having like some guidelines within the residency for gender from environment therapy. And it was incredible to be a part of that process with patients. And also open my eyes up to the massive gap in care that existed for the trans community in a big way actually as a physician. And so from that point forward, decided to dedicate my life to that. And so I have the lived experience certainly as a physician as a healthcare provider who's taken care of many trans people who's taught healthcare providers on how to support trans folks in a healthcare environment and beyond. But as a trans person myself and you know, I have a lot of privilege being a physician. I know about the stuff I can happily teach my doctor because that's what I do for a living but nobody else should have to do that. But even with all that knowledge, I still face a lot of the same challenges my patients face, you know, whether it's, you know, high tier medication, but I'm having to pay for the pharmacy having less than ideal experiences and healthcare facilities. So, yeah, I've seen it from both those sides. And I think that ultimately really led me to starting plume and going on that journey as an entrepreneur, having worked as a physician and practices for a long time in a particular federally qualified health centers and government funded practices. You know, I saw that while it is a system that helps many. There are many people in my community who were falling for the cracks and and felt like I needed to go outside that that system to a certain extent to really build a care system around a community that I'd seen underserved for a long time. So that's an introduction to that answer to that question. Yeah, great. Thank you. Yeah, Kiki. Hey, everyone. Thank you also for hosting. I'm very excited to be here. I think similar to Jericho had always been really struck by healthcare inequities and really motivated to try to address them in some way. I actually initially started in school and in some of my time right after for more of an international development lens, you mentioned some work in Africa. And there it was really interesting to see a lot of focus on family planning and showing you know how allowing people to choose when and how they grow their families is absolutely one of the biggest predictors of quality of life, not just for an individual, but for a full community or even country as a whole. Coming them back to this to the US where I think many of us have sort of taken abortion access for granted given you know many of us having grown up host row. It was really striking to see the reversal of many of those rights, particularly you know I was born in the South went to school in Missouri and you could just see this really slow but salient progression of erosion of autonomy there. I think it was often overlooked again because we took for granted that access but seeing this you know starkness of the effects in these other contexts, I think made them. Perhaps more more obvious of what was really at stake. And then you know of course, as a person who may become pregnant and it's. And it's. Inferiorating and sad to imagine a world in which you know we wouldn't have the opportunity to choose our futures and the status of our own bodies so just really motivated me to want to do something about it. Thank you. Thanks for the those kind of stories of how you got here. As I sort of mentioned in the introduction as digital healthcare companies both plume and hei jane are reaching people whose lives have just been dramatically affected by changes in public policy recently. So it's really exciting to kind of take this lens of entrepreneurship on thinking through some of this it's exciting to hear from you both on this. How do you public policy and entrepreneurship intersect in your companies and how do you think the role of entrepreneurship should be shaping and supplementing public policy in general. Jericho let's start with you. Sure. Yeah. Probably no secrets in many people in this room. There have been many anti trans bills specifically proposed in the last three years in fact 390 and 155 in 2022. And so I think that's a great way to talk about the policy and our acts in a big way with the work that we do since we are entirely dedicated to serving the trans community. Many of these bills also of course overlap with with healthcare context. But even beyond that, the those are the ones you see in the news, but there there's also nuances to the care that we do and medications that we provide. And so we are affected by various laws and various regulations. So it is. Yeah, it's very intricate and lead link to everything that we're doing and. You know, I think entrepreneurs in general tend to operate at the margins to a certain extent right we're often trying to solve problems that are industries. And so we kind of have to step outside the mainstream. And when you do that, you tend to be one, I think under the microscope a bit more and to. Having to confront a lot more regulatory issues and legal and policy issues than maybe otherwise. So, so we're navigating it every day and I personally, I mean we make us a part of our vision, which is of course, first and foremost to provide direct patient care. But also to use that patient care, the insights we gain and the data we have to actually inform not only guidelines for care inside plume and outside of plume for all trans people, but also policy change. And to truly transform healthcare for every trans life. And for the past 12 months, I've spent a lot of time meeting with legislators going to the house, the Senate White House administration. And we can sure that people are aware of the needs of the trans community, especially in a healthcare context. So yeah, it's on our minds every day for sure. Thank you. Kiki, thanks. We have also been navigating a fairly dynamic, which is our environment recently. And of course, the fall of row really exacerbated a lot of the standing issues, but we've been tracking a lot of this closely for a while and S.B. I think was really a precipitating factor as well that of Texas. When RoFell, we had to essentially re-evaluate the locations of all of our providers as we assessed laws that were rolling out in real time. One of our really amazing doctors was driving every single day from Ohio to Pennsylvania in order to be able to provide care. So you think that entrepreneurship has a huge role to play in supplementing political failings and policy failures. We're able to move more quickly to try new things to innovate. You know, we're larger infrastructural changes cannot, I think in the case of he gene, you know, we're able to reduce travel distances by allowing people to get care delivered directly to their home or just over a border into illegal state. We can provide emotional support at their fingertips, because you know via messaging in our app. But I also think it's really important to acknowledge it's not a panacea. There's no way for any single business to overrule these massive changes and the impact they have. So sure we can make things easier, but the logistical burdens are still huge when you have bands across entire states. We can provide more emotional support than may have been available before, but the anxiety of having your body criminalized is something that we're not going to be able to overcome. Without more infrastructural change. So we just think that good policy, good business has to coexist. We're supporting research. I'll drive that policy forward showing again and again that the model is safe effective patients prefer it. In many cases, so hopefully we'll see some of my science driven policy decisions soon. Yeah, I appreciate that. I remember yeah, as we were discussing at the start, you're saying important, but not it's also important to ask what entrepreneurship can't do. So I love the sort of descriptions here what it can do and then also kind of the boundaries of it what it can't do. So both of your companies provide health care to communities that are impacted by public policy. So we're going to face cultural and social marginalization that lead to inequitable health care. So how do your companies work to serve patients in an equitable way and address equity and the health care system as a whole. Yeah, well, you know, I think we. I think we're going to be able to see some of the things that we're going to see in the next few years. And I think we're going to see some of the things that we're going to see in the next few years. We're a company that's entirely dedicated to one of the most marginalized communities in the world. So it's at the very heart of what we do. When we think about equity, of course, access comes to mind. There is not universal training when it comes to gender, for me care, for health professionals. Right. And that's one of the reasons that we did this because even just finding a provider that can provide that care for you is incredibly hard. We also know that a third of trans people are actively discriminated against in a health care facility in this country. So having virtual access that's safe, that's comfortable and expert. You have clinical and cultural confidence is incredibly important in a virtual environment allows us to do that. So access is a big part of that equity piece and, but also affordability and that's something that we're. We're not a lot. And I think there's one thing I was thinking about in that last conversation was, yes, there are bounds when it comes to policy. But there's also a lot of ways we can be creative in the systems that we have. And what I've noticed is the conversation can look quite different than what you see in the media with all these bills, you know, being passed. And so we're talking about the things that are actually happening in the health care industry and specifically around the conversation of health equity and specifically around the trans community. You know, we're talking to a lot of employers, a lot of health insurance companies who really want to find a way to care for their trans and diverse employees. They just don't know how and they've tried 10 years ago and they failed. And then how they're like, hey, how do we do this? And I think that's really, you know, I think thinking about it in different ways, not only just how can we have a service to what kind of service can provide this, but also again, how can we creatively pay for it and thinking about alternative payment models and things like that. So, so there is a lot of energy around this in a big way. More so than I've seen it in the past and specifically with the community that we're serving. Yeah, and so I think that's one of the things that keeps me energized is like it is hard to go out and see the headlines, but it is nice to know that there are many people on the inside who are really trying to push this forward as well. Yeah, absolutely. Financial accessibility has been huge focus for us. We've been seeing as Derek mentioned a lot of appetite from insurance payers to get involved and support this type of work. And I think in ways that hadn't been seen before. We recently launched our first pair contract with Etna, which we're really excited about and are pushing hard for Medicaid as well. And then that it'll have the highest impact on our patient population about 50% make under 25,000 per year. We also do a lot of listening to ensure ongoing equity within our communities. Abortion effects such an incredibly broad swath of people and so making sure that we have representatives from those communities you can give us real time feedback on small details to the site all the way up to you know how we apply. Much broader justice frameworks, they think is really key. And another thing that I think entrepreneurship and particularly tech entrepreneurship really allows for is that ongoing testing and iteration these feedback loops that allow you to constantly be learning from from your patients. In general, just reminding yourself not to read about the wheel to look at the existing literature and all of the amazing partnerships from folks already in space has been really helpful as well as we think about expanding equity. So I had some there and I thought, please, thank you. I thought, yeah, I think the other way that we did mention this before but think about equity is the care teams right and the company that we're building. And you know, we're entirely dedicated to trans community and from those very early days. We wanted to make sure that we're having folks from the gender diverse community being a part of this company, right and everything from our care team are care coordinators who are the frontline folks triage and questions that are coming in our physicians, practitioners, PAs. Our nursing teams all the way to our product teams, our marketing teams, our operations teams, because everybody that touches this, like really is to have a deep understanding of what these folks are going through. And so trying to insert as much of that lived experience into those teams as possible. And of course, also bring on allies who are going to make that lead and bring them, you know, themselves along and learn. And also be able to offer that both clinical and cultural competency when thinking about how we're building these systems. Again, not only the care teams and how we do that, but how we're how we're building a company. And I think we think about in two pathways. One is of course our patients. We want to make sure that they're taking care of and we're driving really strong health outcomes, but also our company. This is a unique place. I mean, over 50% of our company is gender diverse in some way, many intersectionalities beyond that. And really is a unique space employment. We have paid employees every day really coming out on the job and, you know, which is amazing. And people that say that they feel safer in a way that they haven't felt in other environments. And we really take a growth and development perspective. You know, we want folks to first progress through the organization. That's great. But if they find opportunities elsewhere, where they can really leverage the skills and things that they've learned here, and that's also a victory. So, yeah, really like a two-pronged approach in terms of how we think about equity in the trans community. Yeah, that's great. So we've talked kind of. So your companies are just. You know, they're notable and they're significant for the policy challenges that they are navigating. And then as we were just sort of talking about some of the social and cultural marginalization that can happen in some of the equity issues that come up around that. I want to connect these. I want to connect these and I want to ask you for stories of. But I'm building on one of the student questions. I want to talk about business for a second. I want to talk about because you're building businesses like you're dealing with like sort of extreme policy change and regulation. You're dealing with, you know, cultural marginalization in a lot of cases. And your business people, your entrepreneurs, you're like running businesses. So I'm pulling in one of the student questions. Can you tell us about sort of like a maker break moment in your business? Like a maker break decision that you had to make as you were sort of. Being like true like entrepreneurs like you're solving this through business through entrepreneurship. So do you have a story? Can you tell us a story like maker break story for your business? That's probably every day. Every decision that we make. So no, I think. Yeah, there's definitely been some big moments. I do go back to the first time we went out and raised money. You know, I was. It's like literally so my I should mention my co founder. Amazing co founder is helping with some childcare. Because I have a single mom and have a kid because at a festival right now, I got to go to the first half. He took over. And I was like, yeah, so if there's any interruptions, that's what that's from. But you know, we were two doctors with the dream and we literally and Denver, you know, taped a sign on the door of a bar of clinic and saw our first patients. And we knew the potential that was there. Ran that pilot went out and raised money. And I mean, just that moment of landing that first funding. And then we knew that the potential was there. But then hearing that from the venture capital community. Just really affirmed it in a way that maybe we didn't even totally, you know, understand or believe even as much as we wanted to happen. So that was a pretty incredible moment. And I think. Let us know that this was this was really possible. And we've carried them a minimum, a long way. I think. Yeah, I mean, you go through rounds of funding and you just learned so much about your business. And I think, you know, when we started out and so much has changed in last three years as well. We started out a purely direct consumer offering and tried to pick a price point that was, you know, generally accessible and created access fund to go with that. But even then, right, like there was not the interest from health insurance that we're seeing now, right, this whole health equity conversation again is just like taking off and really in the last six to 12 months. And a big way. And so to think like, oh, wow, yeah, we're going to, you know, create contracts with every major pair in the country. That sounds great, but that didn't feel like a total reality, you know, three years ago. And so that was sort of, I think one of those moments where I was like, hey, like one for this to be viable, like we need to do this. It's the right thing to do. And, and now there's actually an appetite for it, right? And so kind of a lot aligned at once. And I think about like expanding our scope of services as well. So, so yeah, I think this last like that first and our last raise were sort of the big two of those bigger moments for me anyways. Yeah, awesome. So how do you think about upholding your company's values when there's like legal consequences or other kinds of risks to doing so? Can you also give us just another example of a time when there was either a legal risk or some sort of other challenge you had to deal with? Absolutely. Listen, our primary goal is to serve patients patients are at the center of every single thing we do. We are not going to be able to fulfill our goal if we get shut down. So even if there are risks that individuals on the team may be comfortable taking, we have to keep that bigger picture in mind. There was recently a really tough decision that we had to make to relocate some members of our team for context on this. And I will say this is one of the few sort of bright spots in the abortion regulatory space right now that's not getting a lot of trust coverage interestingly enough that I like telling people about it. And there's these frameworks emerging called shield laws that basically say we as a progressive state will not participate with cross state lawsuits, so extradition subpoenas from other hostile states related to reproductive health care. Obviously, this is really critical at a time like now where the panel, you know, the consequences can be extremely high for providing medical care. And the decision to require all of our team members to move should these states of shield laws to protect the patients themselves and the business as a whole. There was pushback because a lot of people in the team come from a background of activism, they were comfortable getting arrested. But ultimately, it's not about the individual's risk tolerance. It's about what we have to do as a business to continue striving for admission. And so we did have to make that tough call. Yeah, great example. Thank you, you had the nail in the head. You have these individual decisions. Again, why they can be what people to fill in power, but like we're talking about care for thousands of individuals here, you know, and we always keep that in mind. And we haven't faced, I guess, like a particular scenario yet to be put in a situation of, you know, do you do this or that? I mean, we made decisions early on trying to navigate the laws, or, for example, you know, there's states where we just can't prescribe testosterone virtually. Right. And so that is, I guess the decision that we didn't have to make early and say like, yeah, we could do this. And we could wait for that slap on the wrist, which might turn into something, you know, much more. But we didn't. And so like there's states where we prescribe, you know, more kind of estrogen only or estrogen supportive medications and then find other ways to support folks whether through mental health support, virtual peer support groups, not kind of thing. So that was something we didn't have to do early on. And, and you know, now that I think about it, we did, you know, have to kind of hem and haul about that because we were worried, of course, we want people to get care, you know, worried about what is that. Kind of look like, you know, from an image or reputation thing within the trans community. And I think, I mean, folks have been, of course, very understanding. But that is something that, you know, we still, they'll do in some states. And there's with the P.H.E. you know, in a fact, there's other exemptions that we're able to work under. And there's a lot of unknowns that are, you know, with if and when that P.H.E. expires and what that's going to look like. So, but, but yeah, I think we always have to think about how are we, you know, doing the most good for the most people. And I've seen. Yeah, like hospital systems have to make incredibly hard decisions, especially when it comes to trans youth care, you know, and hospital systems basically saying that they're not going to do that care. Or I'll still be shut down right because of these just incredibly punitive laws that are coming from the states. So, I mean, it's on our minds all the time, but I guess that would be like a specific example of something that we didn't have to do early on. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe I could add on to that by also sharing some examples of times when we expected there to be a potential conflict, but it actually ended up being like a total optimal situation, both for the business and for the patients. And we actually very recently launched a sliding scale payment method are facing before it was 249 natural averages by 50. We already well under that. We are able to reduce that to 199 for patients based off of self reported income with higher prices at the higher end. Our average revenue for per patient went up by a dollar. So we were able to essentially increase conversion across that spectrum, increase access across that spectrum and not impact our unit economics at all. And I think finding these sort of like win wins is one of the greatest toys of the job. And I think really is so much opportunity there that I think you often social impacted business or viewed in conflict. And I just don't think that that's true based off my experience. Let's get well, I'm going to stick with you actually for a because I know that you've actually recently gotten some other good news. So that's a story of where things turned out for you. So here's another one. So you've just completed 6.1 million round of fundraising. And I know oftentimes fundraising as a woman entrepreneur is often painted as a difficult or even impossible challenge. So if you had something to say to that. So yeah, what does your success sort of tell you about, you know, yeah fundraising as an entrepreneur. Yeah, I would say that fundraising is hard. Always right like for a good list of circumstances. It's difficult. I would say that even since I started he gene we have seen such an influx of funds being created by underrepresented founders for underrepresented founders addressing needs that underrepresented founders more commonly identify. I will make the pitch to those in the audience who are interested in VC that this to me is like such an obvious arbitrage right like there's these massively overlooked markets. That no one is touching first movers are beginning to get into those spaces and we are already seeing unicorns emerge within that they are going to be very well rewarded for being on the leading edge. You know, we've had some investors tell us that women's self is niche. It's a trillion dollar market. It's not niche. And I think people are really beginning to see that. And move their capital accordingly. One other thing I've been thinking about recently as it relates to certain groups having more difficulty fundraising. I don't want to underplay that I also want to recognize like absolutely have privileges of white women raising relative to other, you know, underrepresented groups. So not to say it's not hard. But I think it's the market shifts. It'll be really interesting to see whether or not these startups that have not had access necessarily to the, let's say, exuberant funding markets of the past few years will be the ones that make it because we've had to think about sustainability. We've had to build businesses that don't rely on constant injections of external funding. And I'm pretty optimistic to see what emerges there. Yeah, great. Jerika, let me ask this question. How you've talked about the kind of exciting moment where, you know, funders recognized and sort of rewarded what they saw in your business model. You've also kind of talked about the challenges of being a venture backed company that's working on healthcare for a stigmatized community. So how do you navigate your relationship with funders in light of those kinds of dynamics and challenges. Yeah. You know, I think the, well, so one thing that's been nice is the funds and there have been many more funds is Katie mentioned to really focusing on underrepresented communities. But all the funds that we've been working with and a lot of the ones that we've talked to, you know, who are necessarily investing in this are, I think, very excited about supporting the trans community and about the idea. There's a whole business side of it where you have to convince folks as well. This, this idea, you know, being a venture backed company and a healthcare field focusing on a marginalized community. That relationship navigation really comes more with the healthcare provider community and trying to bring folks along there, you know, certainly there was a lot of trust building for our patient community that we've done the last three years. And, you know, now we're getting to that point. I think really doing that in a big way for the healthcare provider community where many people, many healthcare providers who serve underrepresented communities are typically working in FQHC. It's just like I was right for five years before I started Bloom. And the framework is very different, right? And of course, it's a very grassroots approach and relying on grant funding and with very limited resources. And what's interesting, there's a lot of parallels to that, of course, when you get into a startup environment, but you do have a bit more flexibility and agility to an cater systems to the community in a way that I couldn't find a way to do and those other environments. But basically, you can actually go to, hey, actually, no, like we're really building systems that truly center patients that are taking into account access and equity and trying to do that at scale. And that can feel uncomfortable for many who have been spending their whole lives doing this and, you know, you've really gone to treadmill and you're not getting anywhere and you're constantly being told you can't do xyz for your patients. And so, you know, but I think kind of a moment that happened recently, we went to the World Professional Association of Transgender Health Global Conference about a month ago, presented an abstract that was based on some data from our patients looking at fertility desires among trans folks and over 10,000 people in this abstractness was to date the largest abstract ever presented on the trans community period by, by far. And there was an audible gas in the room, this hacked room at a global healthcare conference of a bunch of healthcare providers, right. You know, and I think that and I can just get back to like, you know, being a, yeah, somebody from an underrepresented community who's dedicated, you know, carrying for that community, it can feel a bit like this sort of minority tax, right, which like you've got to be two times, you know, faster, stronger smart than everybody out there. Right, even just to be like, oh, yeah, okay, you're cool, you're legit. And I think there can be a lot of that and it's funnily enough was minimally on the investor side and more on the healthcare provider side in terms of convincing folks that this is actually a meaningful way to provide care. And so, yeah. Yeah, that's so interesting. Well, let me stay with you for a moment. We now get a chance to hear student questions. So the students have been posting in the Q&A in the chat. And I think one of them kind of segues nicely. That's such an interesting perspective that you feel like the or not you feel like that your experience was that with investors, you felt like maybe it was easier than with healthcare providers to sort of share this. So the student question was sort of staying with this idea of kind of like pitching your idea to investors. So how easy was it to pitch your idea to investors? Did you feel like the venture capitalists were evaluating it through the lens of profit, exponential growth or more through the lens of social justice? Like, did you have a sense that like one or the other message was really kind of getting purchased with the venture capitalists? Yeah, I mean, it's all of them. You know, I think it's really you can't really leave any of those out. I think we, given the work that we're doing, we probably gravitated towards funds that had a really like social justice or mission oriented vision. And that was certainly helpful. So there were certainly some education that had to be done, but didn't feel like we had to do a whole lot to convince people that this was like a needed service. Right. I think people could definitely get behind that. And I think wrote the bulk that was like, okay, like how do you explain how you're going to make a sustainable business out with your tam. You know, that was the conversation like every single pitch right and every single diligence after that. You know, you get to your series B and then you have you can like kind of stop explaining that like people get it and there's ways to do it. But, but yeah, that was probably where most of the work was done to get people to that moment of thinking about investing. But yeah, fortunately, you know, hopefully that's a sign things are changing. Didn't have to convince folks too much that this was like needed and I had a good idea to have that. How about you for. Yeah. I would say our experience was, we did have a few pitches that I found particularly frustrating because they came away from it asking, well, should this be a charity. We have substantially higher revenue than the average series. Better margins of fantastic team. Why would we make it a charity. What about the suggests that this would be a charity is basically my question. So I think that some people are still, you know, lording that this dichotomy that I referred to earlier does not necessarily exist that you can genuinely achieve. So that's what comes with the sustainable big profitable business. But for the most part, I think our questions that we got were similar to too much air convention rationalizing, Tam under like explaining the product to people who haven't heard it before. And that, you know, conveying it as a credible opportunity that can grow. Right. So we're actually going to kind of take a right turn here. So the question about platform dynamics. So the question is how do you work to mitigate abuse or misaligned incentives on your platforms. So the example that's given is where companies might have. Issues like over prescription or to because they're trying to grow their business and make money. So platform companies essentially against like as platform companies. How do you work to avoid those sorts of issues. I would say for us, I mean, if something we think a lot about and having seen cerebral in particular. Go the way that it did it really comes down to culture and particularly I think the responsibility and vision that you set from the top. And you want to be a long term business. That means and we want to be responsible business that delivers the highest quality of care. Those incentives are created and making sure that you have a culture that's aligned towards that vision that will create those incentives. I think it's been has been essential. Yeah, culture is huge. And you really have to build that from day one. I think. But the only co founder and I have been really focused on from the beginning of one sort of protected mechanism we have. Is you know, we provide a clinical service, but not necessarily a pill. There's many medications which we prescribe to support folks and whether it's gender firm in hormone therapy, primary care mental health support. It doesn't mean you're completely immune to it and you see you see fraud and abuse happening and the legacy healthcare system, right. In fact, that's where the biggest examples of that are three bills getting a lot of attention now, but I mean take a look at your run of the mill provider system. And you'll see some pretty. Pretty big fraud examples and so. Yeah, but with that, you know, we're providing care to folks and again, like whatever is required to do that. And keeping it like incredibly patient centered, whereas we're not really, it doesn't matter like if it's, you know, estrogen tablets or testosterone injections or antidepressants. We're not tracking it in that way. And also this is the other piece, you know, I think focusing on the health outcomes and that can be something that's emerging in the digital health world, but something that I don't think has been done a lot. Historically, at least like, you know, going back to last five to 10 years and that's what we're watching. And we want to know like, okay, regardless of what's prescribed are we decreasing rates of depression and anxiety? Are we increasing quality of life? Are we making an impact on social determinants of health? I think that is a space in particular where entrepreneurs and startups can be incredibly effective as Keke noted before. You know, it could just be much more agile in the systems that we use and being able to collect data in a robust way and use it for the better. Awesome. This has been just really compelling and interesting to talk with you both. We're to our final question. They told me as guest host, I get the last question. I am actually going to piggyback on a student question. I'm not going to be about technology and data just to warn you, but just to sort of like, you know, set the context for the, you know, sort of the end of the conversation. We've, you know, we've been talking today about entrepreneurship as a way of reacting to public policy and both of you have been leading companies that sort of give you the chance to try to solve problems for communities that are, you know, being affected by public policy. So there's we've talked about challenges. We've talked about just ways that's a very particular, you know, kind of entrepreneurship and particular challenges you face. I want to, I want to end actually just like talking a little bit about digital healthcare and just talking about like platforms and the rise of technology. So the student question is is, and I guess I'm starting it like that because I'd love to hear you kind of link together your vision for, you know, social change for policy sort of reacting to policy and so forth. But the question is like, do you see a shift in kind of healthcare paradigm with the rise of technology. So, Jerika, you were talking a little bit about your abstract rate of 10,000, and equals 10,000, and that's never happened. And that's because you have, you know, data like a kind of a bigger scale and it has ever happened before. So do you see a paradigm shift in the healthcare industry because of the rise of technology and how does that sort of influence some of the things that you're working on. And feel free to like use it as a chance to kind of do like a wrap up a final final statement. Yeah, absolutely 100%. I mean, yeah, the only way that we can even do that is because we have a distributed virtual company that's providing services all over the country. And you just can't do that in a single geographic location. It is literally impossible. When you are talking about serving a community that's so marginalized and underserved. Based on provider availability, but also just the way the population is distributed. So, and that's why we haven't seen it debate, right? And that's why we are seeing it now. You were seeing companies like CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, all of them have opened up these decentralized clinical research units in the last two years, you know, to specifically leverage digital technology to conduct clinical research. So, I think technology, you know, being able to do that virtually, meeting patients where they are. Has actually radically changed started to change the care paradigm. I think we're going to see a whole lot more of that over the next few years. Yeah, totally agree. I think we've been able to see just how the frequency of data collection allows for such a greater nuance of understanding of what patients want in their experience. And that we're able to quickly iterate and adapt to those preferences as we discover them. And Jericho reference us as well, but the community element, I think has been really critical and something that's only enabled by technology and scale. We have a forum where patients having an abortion can connect with other peers going through the same thing at the same time normalize their experience. And that's something that really could never be done before. So, as we think about ways to confront these stigmatized or isolating moments. I think that will be really, really significant. And the last thing I'll say there and I mean, keep you the looting to it, but we actually have data to show that within the trans community just support from another adult can decrease depression rates by as much as 40% and probably more quite frankly. We're not even talking about the position. There's going to have to be somebody in healthcare, just the support of a peer, right? And whether that's somebody who's a youth or an adult just having that support. So, if you are able to provide that support and digitally leveraged way, that is just as meaningful. And that's in me as like, wow, that's mind blown, right? Because if you know that you don't have to navigate licenses and a whole bunch of regulatory issues, you just got to bring it to folks. And of course that goes for many communities in terms of having that support. The entrepreneurial thought leader series is a Stanford e-corner original production.
