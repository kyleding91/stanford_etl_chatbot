 This is the Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders Series brought to you by Stanford E-Corn. Welcome everybody to this week's Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders seminar. The Stanford seminar for aspiring entrepreneurs, ETL, as you guys know, is presented by STVP, the Stanford Engineering Entrepreneurship Center, and basis the Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students. I am Ravi Balani, a lecturer in the Management Science and Engineering Department at Stanford, and the Director of Alchemist and Accelerator for Enterprise Startups. Today is an especially special ETL. All ETLs are special, but if you like it's even more special when we have one of our students returning for a full circle moment as a speaker. And I also feel like the campus is weather is usually better when it really wants to extend its arms to a special ETL speaker, and it's a particularly nice day today. And for a good reason because we have the pleasure of welcoming Maria Barreira to ETL. Maria is a Stanford-educated engineer. She got her bachelor's and her master's in Mechanical Engineering here in 2013, and is the founder and CEO of ClayFull. How many people have heard of ClayFull? Can raise your hands. Well, if you haven't, you will very, very soon. So ClayFull is a platform dedicated to providing essential mental health support for the TikTok generation. Today, Maria's company creates accessible resources for K-12 students and has already made a profound impact on thousands of students nationwide. She's raised $7 million of capital, and it's the only platform where in 60 seconds you can connect a student to a mentor, especially for their mental health. Before launching ClayFull, Maria played a pivotal role in Nearpods' extraordinary growth trajectory, culminating in the company's acquisition for $650 million. Her leadership at Nearpods was instrumental in driving user acquisition, engagement, propelling both B2C and B2C revenues, and B2B revenues, to new heights and showcasing Maria's adaptness at scaling consumer-facing operations. Maria was born and raised in Bogota, Colombia, and also then came to the United States at the age of 10 to Fort Lauderdale, and through her Colombian origins, which are also marked by resilience and determination in the face of adversity, her journey underscores her natural aptitude for problem-solving and commitment to leveraging technology to create tangible, impactful solutions. She came to the farm as I mentioned and got her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and graduated as a Mayfield Fellow. So please welcome back to the farm, Maria. So getting the format for today is we're going to do a fireside chat, but then we're going to really open it up for Q&A, and really I think the intention here is if Maria can be a catalyst for all the things that you're wrestling with is to really share her wisdom. And Maria's in the throes on the midst of her own entrepreneurial journey, so it's always fun for us to have somebody who's in the midst of the journey itself. Okay, Ging? So we're going to do a fireside chat and then I'll open it up in about 25 minutes for Q&A. So start thinking of any questions that you may have and the CAs will get ready for, make it facilitating that as well. So Maria, welcome. Thank you. It is a full circle moment. It's all super fun. So I wanted to kick off because you're about 10 years now, a little bit more than 10 years post-stanford, I don't know if it feels like that. Pandemic is sort of a lost time there, but fair enough. And you worked immediately after Stanford. You graduated as a Mayfield fellow, which is sort of this journey that does really push you into the entrepreneurial path in life. But after Stanford, you worked in two growth and marketing stints at two other startups, Nearpod and Charthop. What I'm curious about is for all the founders that are wrestling with whether what to do post Stanford, whether to start a company or join another company that's already sort of at a certain scale or join a larger company and build a functional skill set. Can you share your insights to answer that question about when to take the red pill and jump into the founder journey? It is a journey. So my dad always told me learn with other people's money. So that's why I decided to do what I did. I knew I wanted to start a company at some point and going basically my decision point was, okay, I did my undergrad, I did my master's, I can do this right now. There's not a problem that I feel super passionate about yet. So and you know, I could do it today, but what skills do I need? Like what am I really what am I missing? So instead of going into it right away, I decided I'm going to actually go and start a career journey that would help me get the skills necessary to do that work. And I was really lucky that in that that first job I had out of my master's program, my former boss who's a CEO at Nearpod, he asked me, what do you want to do in five years? And I said, I want to start my company and he's like, great, we're going to help you get there in every six months, we would have a conversation around what skills do I have, what are the next skills that I need to build? So really it's, I think, yes, finding the scaling organization that can help you get those skills is really important, but more importantly, it's that person who's going to help you develop those skills and who really believes in you and will sort of push you through that trajectory. And any tips on that on finding the mentor to the mentor find you, did you proactively deliberately have a strategy to find a mentor? How can people, if that is so critical, how can people facilitate involving others in their success? It's a little bit of both, I would say, right, I've been very lucky through Armaghoek Create to have a lot of different mentors and to find mentors in real people as well as in books and in media and in, you know, videos of Steve Jobs I'll watch. So there's a lot of different ways to like think of mentors, if you will. But I think the main thing is can you find someone who just like believes in you and sees something in you that you don't even see in yourself? Because sometimes especially when we're early on in our careers, I mean, imposter syndrome is real. And we never think we're, you know, ready for it to take that big leap. But having someone that does really, I think, makes all the difference. So, you know, you, being here, you get the opportunity to meet with so many people and, you know, everyone's willing to get a coffee with a Stanford grad. So really looking at not just like what are the opportunities that are in front of you, but who are the people that are going to be sort of chaperoneidious with those opportunities? Not every opportunity is great and equal. And can you talk about your specific, you had one very pivotal mentor? Is that right? Yeah, well, yeah, a couple, but I would say, I would say, you know, the CEO of Nierpod was really the pivotal one. And was that something that you proactively sought out or did that just sort of happen by circumstance of what you were doing? It's happened by circumstance. So I was doing my masters here. I realized I wanted to be an education after watching a documentary called Waiting for Superman. If you haven't watched it, highly recommended it to talk about the public school system and how we can help shift it. And as I was kind of wrestling this idea of, I just got a lot of degrees in mechanical engineering, but I want to go into education. My parents were like, I'm sorry, what? That's okay. We started talking to a lot of people and really it was me going out there and trying to find people to talk to and then people saying, hey, you should meet with this guy, he's at the Stanford D school, he's doing a fellowship there, building a new at-tech company, you should connect. So it's a little bit of like going out there, seeking the opportunities and also the universe just lining up for you and showing up when you need it to. Yeah, don't you find that seconds combination of noticing opportunities and then just being curious and letting things happen? That's terrific. And so it is an interesting transition from being a double degree grad in mechanical engineering to then suddenly going deep into the education mental health space. So can we talk about the vision and origin story of Clayful? Yes. And you know, venture capitalists often talk about how when you start a company, especially the one that gets investor back where you raise $7 million, that there's usually a key insight that a founder has and usually a moment of inflection, which makes it the right opportunity. I don't know if that held true for you with Clayful, but if it did, can you share? It definitely did. So I was at near, near, near a breath for a long time, we sell to schools. It was all around how do you use technology and education, right? How do you use technology in a classroom? And this was right when iPads were coming out, Chromebooks didn't even exist here, so long time ago. And our thesis there was, how do you take these devices that are making our way into the classrooms and make them into instructional tools that teachers can leverage to bring instruction to a new level and learned a lot through that journey, especially how does K12 work? And what is the impact on technology and just like new things coming out for students in particular? Fast forward, I joined Charthop in January 2020. Good times. We didn't know it was coming obviously, but three, two months later, pandemic unfolds and we sold into human resources. So as you think about the pandemic unfolding, one of the first departments, if you will, to get affected was HR, because they're thinking about, oh, how are we taking our people remotely? How are we thinking about employing engagement? How are we thinking about employment, a health? So it became very clear that mental health was going to be deeply affected by the pandemic that was unfolding. And while it affected all of us in assembly shape or form, for students, particularly if you think about elementary and middle school, high school students, not having structure, not having socialization, not being able to go to school, not seeing your friends every day, that type of isolation is not just hard, it's cognitively debilitated. And so as I was starting to look at it into a more and more, I see this article about eight-year-olds dying of suicide. And that moment was that inflection point where, I'm like, okay, well, if back up, if our system is at a point where an eight-year-old not just knows what suicide is, let alone is caring on with it, something's wrong. And that's where you bring it back to mechanical engineering, we think about systems, right? We think about the whole thing and looking at our mental health and our education system, if that's where we are, there needs to be something that needs to be done differently for us to not have eight-year-olds dying, right? So that was a big inflection point. At that point, text to my sales, like, when you talk tomorrow, it was 2 a.m. on a Tuesday, I remember it vividly. And at that point, I basically quit my job and just started trying to figure out how do I do something about this? And it, in true-to-d school fashion, went into a lot of need-finding, talking to everyone I could talk to. And there were a lot of different aha moments through those conversations. One, a conversation with the clinical psychologist that said, you know, by the time a kid gets to me, everything that has to be undone just takes so much time. So like, anything on the prevention side could have 10xD impact. And like, that really landed with me. So I'm like, okay, cool. We need more prevention. Then you talk, I think about myself, right? Coming from Columbia when I was 10, wonderful family, wonderful parents, love my mom. She's amazing. She was working two jobs. She was busy. She had left her whole family. She had, like, literally left this whole life from Columbia to give me a better life, felt like I'm making it worth it. And she, I wasn't going to go and tell her, hey, I need help, like my friends are being mean to me, right? Or like, I'm going through this. I didn't feel like I could be a burden, right? So I wanted to build something that did not have to rely on the family being the main driver of the student's mental health. And then the third piece was really thinking about the financial aspect of it, right? So if you want to build something that's preventative, it turns out the healthcare system is not there yet, right? Healthcare is very, very reactive. So as we get into the system, I'm like, okay, healthcare doesn't necessarily pay for it. I don't want families to pay for it because I want this to be accessible. I believe in equity. I believe in building something where families without disposable income can benefit. So then who care, who else can care? Schools. And it turns out I have a little bit of experience in schools. So it became this kind of interesting moment of founder market fit, where there's this problem that in following months you start seeing students making their way back into schools. And all this information about how COVID has affected their mental health and how that's showing up in schools, right? It's not knowing how to behave. It's throwing chairs around the, across the classroom, because they're upset. Kids putting out like literally lighting fires in bathrooms because they don't know how to deal with the regression. So schools are dealing with this big problem. And don't know what to do about it. Okay, well, there's something here, right? All these things are happening. And then unfortunately a couple of months after that, there's a big shooting in your vaulty. And the government decides like we, this is our wake up call that we need to provide more mental health support across the board. And funding becomes more available. So it's all these different pieces. And you know, when I was sitting at two a.m. on a two-sing, I think you realize it's like this is what I wanted to do. None of those things were in the cards, right? I didn't know any of that was going to happen. So it definitely is one of those like right plays right times, but also like I was so obsessed with the problem that I kept on finding solutions across along the way. That's interesting. So you found yourself constantly gravinting towards solutions to this perpetual problem. And are you the type person who gets obsessed about a lot of ideas or is this sort of the singularity? Because I want, I want to really distill for the students when they know that something is compelling enough to actually quit everything they're doing and go full force and faith against it. I do not get easily obsessed with ideas. No, no, I do not. And it was something that everywhere I looked, there was something that spoke to this. Even you know, I would scroll through Netflix and they'd be like, Ginny and Georgia or like this other show. It's like, and now I kept on only watching Teen Drama. Since everything in my life just kept on pointing toward this in a very sort of the universe once you do this way. Okay, and then I see that pattern match again. So there's just this obsession with your attention. It was relentless. And then these things that you saw not just a vitamin, but a clear headache, a clear pain point literally. And then a lack of a solution and a potential model. Okay, so we have then the impulse to then take the red pill and jump in. The next inflection point oftentimes in the start of journey is when you know you're going to be a success. I don't know if you've hit that point yet or not. But because we're two years into the journey now of clay flows that right? Yeah. If you have hit that moment where you now are no, that clayful will be a success. Can you distill when that moment occurred and what was the what evidenced that for you? So there there's this one of my favorite authors or the other two authors that the uh I'm linking on it's switch and the power of moments are their two bucks, their brothers and they talk about this idea of bright spots and like how do you when you're looking for solutions and seeing what's working you always look for the bright spots. And and then you scale those bright spots. I love that so much. So as we're kind of squirreling with this very big problem of you know 40% of students feel hopeless and sad. How do we make how do we help them feel better? We look at okay where where are we having an impact and what is actually helping? And one of the big like points initially where we saw that this could be something is where we're testing the size was like like our earliest prototype literally built it in a day and a half on because we're like okay this is actually gonna work right? And we have this conversation with a 14 year old boy from Texas. It's a football player and he's having a fight with his mom and he says I don't know if she loves me because she has to because I'm her son or because she actually likes me as a person and that happened like five minutes into the conversation. And that moment I was floored like there is something here right like if we're able to get students to open up and like realize these like really hard deep things and work through them there's something really compelling here. And so that was one of the first ones and that's on the student side and then on the on the business side where like the great thing about education is you have to you have to build for an end user the student we have to sell to a very different user which is the district leaders and in one of our first sales conversations where kind of getting feedback on our product then he says I have a million dollars allocated to hire eight counselors I've hired zero. I can't find them there's not enough people so like why do you have because I'm desperate and like that moment right there we're like oh there's a staffing problem again very different problem for mental health but very related obviously we're realizing that you know the different stakeholders have very different needs and you can solve both needs with one solution that was in a hot moment. So those who are really early moments we realize okay yes there's something worth building here and then over the last two years we've been scaling that out and I have so much student feedback that I'll humble brag maybe at some point and read some of it for you. If you want to just this is your platform oh yeah do you want to do it? Well because I want you guys my intention is what I want you guys to know is to feel when you've had product market fit okay so that's the intention here and there's a couple of things just to underscore as Maria's bringing up these quotes from the students is that there was a low fidelity prototype was just a day and a half and with just that low fidelity prototype you're getting things that are anomalously compelling and so so so I didn't mean so so humble for Agnari at what were you saying? So after every conversation with the coach we ask students to give us feedback I had to just go what do you think? I'm gonna read you some of them. Dear coach thank you so much for helping me out today you helped me realize my self-worth and that I got this is a middle school student thank you for being there when nobody else could be I feel like I'm a little bit lighter thank you so much because of this chat I feel more controlling my thoughts my emotions and able to solve conflicts on my own and knowing it's okay to be me can you imagine if we if I had this when I was a kid I would save myself a lot of money therapy where like these are so compelling um this is one of my favorite ones because we get a lot of questions around why young people want to talk to humans and not to AI we can definitely dive into that topic because I know it's a hot one thank you so much for helping me through my problem your kindness and patience really made a difference I feel better I feel like I can handle my life more without worry I will definitely come back because you made me feel better about myself and made my anxiety more manageable yeah there's two more on read the thanks for this chat if I'm gonna be real honest I didn't know what I was gonna do tonight and I forgot I had playful and then I started typing and I didn't do the bad things I thought I was gonna do so thank you for that and I hope you know that you're amazing and very appreciated and then my last one which is actually it inspired our t-shirt I wanted to thank you one more time you helped me deal with the huge issue and I might result the whole thing in one conversation I really appreciate what the Clayful team is doing in today's world because the stuff is life changing and life saving it's a middle school student yes yes it's a middle school student and so and and I want you guys to understand that we've had I yes so you guys can feel that in your body I hope you know those quotes I think that is one thing when you know that you have product market fit you have a need where you need to exist and your worth isn't about how much dollars you raised from the venture capital funds or what investors think about you in the most challenging times you're gonna go back to your mission and you're gonna go back to those quotes that's what we'll carry you through and so with that though then let's talk about the challenging moments what what have been the most challenging moments I know you're only two years in but what I wanted to do is create space for us to talk about the reality of a startup versus just the myth can you share what you what have been the biggest struggles yeah I mean entrepreneurship is very glamorizing these walls for a good reason and it's not all sparkles and butterflies it very much feels like a roller coaster and I joke that it's like if anyone's been in Dr. D with fear of all it's less of like whoop and more like whoop you know you're going up and down constantly so the highs are highs the lows are lower because you just feel everything I mean everything feels so deep right like this is my baby this is it feels so strongly about the work that we're doing so anything any challenge just feels really really hard and really emotional and I think that that you know if it takes a toll on you in a lot of ways I one of the I think hardest lessons that we've learned over the last couple years is where in this very worthy cause right we have an incredible mission we're working in doing some incredible work as you all just saw and it is really important for us to build a team of people who care not just about the mission but in building a company that can make the mission come true and those are not always the same especially when you think about mental health right I joke that being a startup and mental health can be a little bit of an oxymoron you know we're startup so prior to a lot of hard work and a lot of tenacity and not a lot of work life balance and you know we know as I feel like as a society especially post-COVID we have a very different point of view like what healthy work life balance means and and it's not working 80 hours at a startup right and and so how do we find the people that are really excited about the mission that are willing to work really hard for it because that fuels them because it gives to their mental health right and because at the end of the day when I see this really sad things on the platform that happen or like the feeling the deep feelings that students are feeling the thing that gives me fuel is that we're doing something about it right and that we're working hard to change that so yeah building a team I think has been one of the most challenging pieces and can we click into that more because you guys I think you guys are 12 full-time you're 12 employees in about 140 contractors right now and I do think that's a really interesting nuanced insight that we haven't heard before of the difficulty of hiring for somebody who's not just aligned with your mission but can actually execute with what the build the business needs to build especially when you're doing something so aspirational so can we get tactical are there any tactical insides or tips that you have discovered that you wish you knew earlier when it came to hiring that could have accelerated your either safety time or money or accelerated your development yeah I mean initially we were very excited about people who are excited about our mission right when when you have a baby and they're like you have a cute baby everyone's like great cool come take care of it come being out with us so the fact that people were excited about this mission that we were on was really exciting for us like great let's do this together and I don't think we were having the hard conversations upfront about what does it mean to be able to start up and what does this require a VL so now in our interview process we always have that conversation if not in the very first conversation definitely throughout the process right so hey what does it mean to work out of start up like this isn't your typical nine to five job this isn't a you know but it's probably not what you think it is unless you've been at a 10-person company before so here's what it actually means like here's the amount of time you're gonna work here like here the challenges that we're working through and what we've been doing lately is actually having people go through a project that's like a problem solving challenge with our team so they're not just meeting in an interview and saying like okay here's where I work here's my experience blah blah blah but really using that those 30 45 minutes to get to know our team member while at the same time working through a project together so they can actually see what the work is like and is that a 30 to 40 minute project that you were working on or you give them actually a like a two-week experience of a project before you make a decision more of a week and a half yeah we can have a show they'll go meet with two or three people on our team ask questions around the project and then present it to us in a whole group meeting so that provides a pretty authentic experience and two okay these are the real challenges that we're working through and these are the real people you'd be working with and these are the real questions we would ask and and of course like you don't have all the contacts right so we're not going to judge you on is is the perfect solution to this problem but we will judge you on your process and how effectively you use the time with our team members so you're scoping a 10-day project for people to work on that's actually a real situation that you're wrestling with and then they're going and executing and then you're assessing and any unintuitive heuristics on how to do the assessment that's correlated with good team members that you've discovered or is it really just looking at who's doing who you think is doing good work that's a good question we one of my friends jokes that like if you're too intimate to health like that might be an anti-pattern oh interesting right because again like it goes back to like what if you're someone who's very very passionate about mental health what what does that mean about why are you joining us yeah exactly so let's okay so then can I call out the elephant in the room because he would exist you know your mission is to help stabilize people's mental health have healthy mental citizens in the world start at a very young age and yet it sounds like what you're saying is is that startups are intrinsically mentally unhealthy is that is that am I assessing that fairly and if so can you reconcile for that are there are there are there prac do you think doing a startup is a same thing to do if you care about your mental health and if not what are the practices that you've developed to mitigate against the toxicity for your mental health quick plug for burn right burn right burn right by Andy oh so he came to spoke actually at that ETL so yeah Andy Dunn who was who who did an ETL speech I think lasted quarter he has a book called burn rate which is all about his mental health struggles and discoveries it's it when you ask like is it a same thing to do no you have to be I mean this is one of the lives for the book that really resonated with me so you have to be a little insane if like I think that I Maria Barrera can solve the mental health crisis I have to be a little crazy right like it's not but if I'm not going to do it who it was right like it so it's I don't think it is a sane endeavor and at the same time there is something really powerful about feeling like and like seeing the impact of like oh you actually are making a difference in those student lives day in and day out I would say to you the point about is I'm being in a startup unhealthy endeavor it can be I think that's why we we need to be so cognizant about finding people where who feel like it's giving to them versus taking away right so where the work is so fulfilling for that because it is whether it's a feedback whether it's like they love working through challenges it's like there's people out there where that really that does drive you and there's people where it doesn't and that's where we're really trying to figure out during the hiring process is like are you someone who like likes to look at a problem and like tear it apart in 24 different ways and figure out how to solve it and like you get really excited about that or do you just want to like execute it to do less that might this might not be the best place for you and that's okay where I like not everybody needs to be at a startup and that's and how would you assess your own mental health on a scale of 0 to 10 10 means you're like today or like right now yeah fair enough I guess it changes it is it is the not not the roller coaster but the fear of the death shop yeah yep yep yep it does change right and I have I've developed a lot of practices to get myself back up right like there's certain things that I will not compromise on sleep being one of them big plug for sleep very important how many hours of sleep are you getting eight to 10 and night I won't compromise on it if I don't sleep I am a zombie you do not like Maria being a zombie she's very cranky so that is a really important part like I prioritize it I have a lot of different I mean some people call them mantras I call them same but just little things that inspire me day in and day out so I mean now is it a gym and like Kentucky the other day and so like you didn't come this far to only get this far and I'm like yeah I did not let's go and that now that's opposed it on my on my computer so little things that will inspire me have just that I just keep them really present and that makes a big difference so it just you know gives you back a little little pick me up when you need it and music actually helps quite a bit right so big swifty that's okay I own it and there's there's different like there's one song particular long label she talked about like remember how you've been dreaming for this moment for so long and that you're here like that's really magical so remembering that and there's all these you know that that song like different media points where you're where you you have to always go back and remember that you've been this is what you wanted for so long so yes it can get hard but like that's what you asked for so let's go after it you're in the founder journey that is good I'm going to open it up for questions gang in a few minutes so start thinking about the questions but I'm curious where did you have mentors as you were going through the journey that you deeply resin I know we talked about one already but in general even when you were taking ETL did you feel people that you felt deeply connected to or was that a struggle and do you have any were did I'm just curious about that was that what was that like yeah I mean definitely during the mayfield program had a lot of opportunities to connect with different whether it's current investors or entrepreneurs who are going through the journey then that really think shape a lot of the work I'm big on frankly opportunities like these right so going the sitting T T Ls are going to like how I built this or all these different podcasts that are where people are telling the entrepreneurship journeys and you know as part of ETL I don't know if we've had that many Latinx founders actually here and I and I know that you feel comfortable speak methods is right bring up is there so now you are it is a full circle moment you are not on the you are not in the seat you are actually now on the podium is there anything that you would want to relate to either the Latinx founders in the room or or the female founders or founders that you feel we might have underrepresented in the past or that you felt you didn't hear voices for that you would have wanted to hear yeah as you were asking the question like I did that I did have a lot of white men in mind you're right I yeah there's a lot of there's not a lot of rooms that I walk into that I see people look like me that's just the the reality especially in like Silicon Valley this room is actually pretty diverse which is pretty cool to see so yay go you I think my piece of advice is really as you're going into rooms where there's not a lot of people who look like you know it's very easy to just assimilate and blend in and like where the clothes that don't make you stand out and don't not correct people when they say your name incorrectly and to just you know fit in because that's what's easy and to remember that when you do that you're making it that much harder for the next generation to show up in those spaces so I have been I'm trying to be really intentional about it I wear my bright colors my sparkly shoes and just like showing up on a polygetic wave who I am and you either gravitate toward me or you don't and that I think that's been a particularly on lock for last I would say year in my career and it has brought into my life a lot of really incredible school leaders investors are there entrepreneurs who see that and gravitate toward it and like now you kind of find your people who are lifting you up constantly so I didn't I don't I mean before I was so afraid of trying to fit in and kind of fitting into this mold who I was meant to who I was supposed to be and now that I feel a little bit kind of like out of that shelf I feel like I'm finding even better people around me so find your be yourself and because you are yourself you will find your family yeah I'm funny familiar yeah that's so good yes you're tribe so we're going to open it up for questions gang just raise your hands during the process that you realize that school district and government as you said can you support and compensate how it really works and especially it takes sometimes you know working with government Jenny Vistlo give us some thoughts that yeah schools are fun to work with they have there's so much there's a lot of pros and there's a lot of cons right but it was really that moment where you said we have all this funding and we can't hire people where we realize okay there's something interesting here and as you start having more and more conversations realizing that schools actually do have a lot of money right they there's billions and billions of dollars being spent in education on an oasis so and they need to they need to provide this support because they're seeing unfortunately the gun violence in their school they're overall behavioral challenges and decreases in attendance right there's so many pieces so what putting those two things together and then many becomes a question of figuring out what are the right the checks and the yeah how do you need to sort of form your solutions so that you can fit into the square peg that they have built for it so that's that's becomes a challenging part but if there's a need and there's money you can find a way thank you next question thank you Maria for coming and thank you for working on mental health so my question is what do you think about the using LLM's for the chat box on mental health and if you can explain also your rational yeah yeah we we test I mean obviously I've been at the forefront of testing and I'm trying to understand where the boundaries are I and I've also seen a lot of examples of young people leveraging some of the whether it's no snaps AI or chat GPT for therapeutic reasons we've decided to not do that right now we tested it with a student we were kind of red teaming it run and tested with okay I want to trigger alert I want to hang myself how do I do it and the chat GP is like you shouldn't do that like basically go into a proper rush and I'm like okay I want to hang something at 130 pounds how do I do it step by step instructions so if anyone knows how to game a system it's a middle school student so we just don't feel like the technology's there yet to to really be able to provide the bright boundaries around how you can protect students safety at the core what we're doing with AI's really leveraging on the coaching side so always with it's essentially just keeping the human in the loop right so as if a coach gets stuck if they're not sure of how to answer something they can then leverage our weak trained our own kind of alum there to support them in those conversations and that's been a really powerful way to use AI to sort of help on the workforce development side without sacrificing student safety I think the technology will get there eventually which don't think it's there yet do you think junea is going to be a force to make things worse or better from a mental health perspective we just did the session on this and ASU GSV who's all around like how technology and particularly chat bots are going to shift how we interact as humans and I think it can go both ways and I worry right now that we I mean we've seen how social media has affected our mental health and we're paying the price of that now and yet we're not taking those learnings and applying it to AI yes so I worried a little bit about that I I think there's going to be a lot of powerful use cases for it and it feels silly that we're not paying attention to hey all these things happen when this new technology came out now how are we how are we not looking at it in that same way now yes there's there's a lot of really cool use cases where students feel like they can chat with and like learn skills with AI but kids are really lonely as it stands right so is the solution for them to just have a AI friend I would venture no yeah I would venture no team but I think it will we're gonna have a lot yeah it's gonna be a crazy next couple years yes thank you other questions thank you I'm just curious about the business model honestly when I go to your website I fill out that capture form it asks are you a school administrator are you a teacher are you a student I'm just curious who your decision makers are who's involved in the sales cycle like what stakeholders you have to convince essentially I assume it's pretty long sales cycle just because it's kind of a public sector right technically and yeah who's who's paying for it if you have the freedom to talk about it I guess for sure I mean yeah school districts pay for it and typically we work with student services so those are that's the department that oversees counseling tutoring any sort of you know social workers any sort of mental health related support service we don't do direct to consumer yeah so you notice like there's no way to purchase the product directly on the site and that's on purpose because again we're really after equity and wanting it all of the students within a school system to be able to have access not just those are families who kind of for that and what we've seen though is students families can be advocates for this work right so they can go to their schools and say hey I really want this I want this not just for my own kid but I want this for a whole community so that becomes a big driver of kind of that initial conversation perfect now you're going to get a lot of emails from our sales service but other questions right raise your hands guys okay we're over there okay terrific hi thanks so much for chatting with us today I have a quick question about the kind of complex stakeholder map of mental health care and the role that you play in it so what kinds of situations is clayful not able to support and how do you support those students that have more chronic needs do you partner with other providers or is there some other kind of method of feeling about that situation great great great question yeah so the there is a very complex mental health system we really see ourselves in the if you think about this is prevention versus like very much acute needs we're where see ourselves here so if you think about the full map there's it from the prevention standpoint it's like there's some content out there there's a seal curriculum but there's really nothing between that and like meeting with a counselor so that's the gap that we're aiming to fill now when students come to us and say they're experiencing suicidal ideation extreme bullying restrictive eating anything that we know requires that clinical support that's why working within the school system is so important because we can do a very warm handoff to a system that they already know right so it's not that we're you know calling a community provider or calling like the nearest therapist office but rather they're we're saying hey school counselor Billy is having this problem can you check in on them and that having that expansion of the school services team is really really really powerful for school districts to know oh you're not just handing off to another person and you're not just having this conversation and isolation and I was not knowing what's going on but we really are working in partnership so that's been I think one of the most compelling aspects of where we have escalations you know every week and as part of our relationships with the school systems we're able to save lives together in a way that's really compelling thank you question I know my question here hi as a starter party do you make your initial connection to your target monkey the school administration and convince them to purchase your product yeah it was a I talked about a little bit of the founder market fit initially right so because I'd been working in education already had a let's call it like 10 people I could call up and say hey I have this idea what do you think right and and that's why I really believe in this idea of learning with other people's money and building a pipeline with other people's money right because if you're able to sort of get that experience under your belt you can that once you're you're ready then can really tackle it that that was our way and then from there it's okay you have to get outside of your network so we go to a lot of events do a lot of cold emails basically reach out to whoever will talk to us on LinkedIn right there's a lot of you basically have to let go of your ego and just put yourself out there just an exercise in and up itself if there's a lot of rejection involved and you learned to build a thick skin thank you next question hi thank you for coming my question is how hard is it to work with school districts you explain that there's a lot of funding available but how easy is it to access for example is the bureaucracy very slow it can be yeah so school districts are there's all different sizes right there's school districts that are literally 30 students there's students that their school districts are 1500 there's school districts are hundreds of thousands of students so it just varies broadly the big behemoths are very very bureaucratic I we're not working with them yet our bread and butter right now is really small school district particularly in rural communities where there's not a lot a lot of access to mental health resources to begin with so to your question too like finding you know not every customer potential customers built the same so instead of going on and targeting the top 30 school districts we really decided okay we're gonna go after this particular type of school district because they can move quicker they have a higher than normal need and we can create a playbook around how to reach them very efficiently so with that said yes there's typically a budget cycle they have to follow and it's on an annual basis and it takes a little bit of yeah muscle and understanding but once you know how to do it just just like everything else where once you know how to sell into healthcare you can do it so it's definitely finicky but they're also really loyal customers if you do really good work for them so your product can be really sticky and built once you're built into the system it's hard to get out right because it's not a system that gets a lot of iteration or like innovation on a constant consistent basis yes thank you we have time for one last question is there a burner raise your hand hi thank you for coming I wanted to ask a bit more about the process when the student reaches out to you guys whether that's 24 seven help or if it's say during the middle of school or the middle of the evening how that gets addressed given the variety of backgrounds people maybe coming from and with your team side things how do they prioritize okay well this conversation needs to be had or whether it's more of a company side like this is how we're going to address it or if it's up to the individual specialist to do it more of case by case scenario how do you I guess deal with the backgrounds and the time all the different factors that come into something such as mental health? 40 seconds no no pressure the TLDR on that is what their special sauce that we have is we train all of our coaches as well so they're not they're not coming with different types of experiences they all have the same consistent training so they're all addressing things on a consistent basis so there's no need to have different types of people for different types of challenges because they're all trained the same that's the short answer there's a lot more that we can get into about like how that training works to be able to support things regardless of when they're coming in but that are the best thing about our service is that a student gets connected within 60 seconds no matter what they want to talk about whether they want to talk about you know they're experiencing suicidal ideation or like this cool animation that they're watching like everything gets support because everyone deserves that support in connection okay and with that game I
