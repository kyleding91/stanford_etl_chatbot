 Hey ETL listeners, this is Mike Leppick, professor and faculty director of the Stanford Technology Ventures program which produces ETL. The ETL series is currently taking a break, but don't worry, we've got more than two decades of incredible ETL content available on our Equiner platform, YouTube, and wherever you get your podcasts. During the break, we'll keep your podcast feed flowing with a special ETL looks back series highlighting some timely gems from our archives. To kick off the school year, we'll feature talks on education starting with Salcon, founder and CEO of Khan Academy. ETL looks back, will be published right here in your regular ETL feed. There's nothing you need to do. And be sure to stay subscribed for future announcements about the return of the series. We share your enthusiasm for ETL and we can't wait to bring you more new episodes. Until then, enjoy ETL looks back and find more episodes from our archive at stvp.stanford.edu forward slash e-corner. Thanks for tuning in.
