 Who you are defines how you build. This is the OddPronoel Thought Leader Series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. Hello everyone, my name is Emily Ma and I'd like to welcome you to the OddPronoel Thought Leader Series presented by the Stanford Technology Ventures program, which is the Entrepreneurial Center in Stanford School of Engineering. Also sponsored by Basis, the Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students. Today, I am thrilled to welcome Jessica McHeller to ETL. Jessica McHeller is the founder and CTO of Pilot.com, an accounting firm powered by software that has raised more than 160 million inventor capital. She earned her bachelor's and master's degree in computer science from MIT and prior to pilot, she was on the founding teams of two other startups, Kate Spice and Zulit. She also teaches Python at California's San Quentin State Prison and through that experience, she became passionate about building bridges between the tech industry and individuals impacted by the prison system. So that's definitely something we're going to talk about. Welcome Jessica. Let's start by maybe an introduction to everyone of what pilot.com is and what kind of users it serves for small businesses and startups. Let's start with that. Sure, pilots how I retire, that's the high level that's it now. Yeah, so pilot is basically an accounting firm, but one that works in a very special way because a lot of the work that we do behind the scenes to deliver accounting services, bookkeeping, tax, CFO services, other advisory support, a lot of that work happens in software, which is good for us, but it's actually good for the customer as well because it means we can deliver. A higher quality, more consistent experience, and we can also do things with data that nobody else can do to reflect kind of insights back to the customer in a way that nobody else can. So we've built a business around bringing small businesses into the 21st century with their finance and accounting needs, which has been a deeply satisfying thing to work on over the past five years through a bunch of growth in our customer base. Getting to work with a lot of small business owners and startups and to really viscerally experience their pain and then hopefully solve it for them through some healthy fundraising where we're kind of post series C company. And then just working with a really incredible team of really incredible finance and accounting experts who are all like in house leveraging the software to deliver the service and then also a really talented R and D team that's building out the automation behind what we do. Yeah, so we solve your finance and accounting back office as a small business and we help you be competitive with bigger companies, you have a lot more facilities to take care of this internally than the typical small business does. It's amazing. We're going to get come back to that comment a little bit. Maybe we can rewind in a number of years to when you were at MIT. So you've had this incredible incredible career with these three startups, but you know, all of us were once a freshman and I'm curious to be one back at the clock. Like how did you decide to study computer science? Like what did you experience that led you to wanting to do a start off your first one and like what else happened during that time that inspired you to take this path. And I just a little tiny bit of background on me. I had born in California, grew up in Nashville, went to a public school in Nashville. My dad's a musician. My mom is, oh, hi mom, mom, I'm watching. Hi mom. Mom is like a free spirit who's done a lot of things in her life. So I, you know, I didn't know anybody who was interested in programming while I was growing up, although I would say that my dad had a strong affinity for computers because what you could use them for for music. I actually thought I was going to be a chemist and my first degree is actually in chemistry. And I, while going through the chemistry undergrad program at MIT, I accumulated a lot of friends who were in the CS department because that's the largest department at the school. And, you know, honestly, I think I was, I was kind of was watching them out of the corner of my eye while I was going through my chemistry studies. And I saw them learning what seemed like a very powerful, very general toolkit of tools to solve a broad range of problems in the world through programming through software engineering. And I decided that I wanted to have that kind of toolkit as well chemistry is great. It's a very kind of it's its own discipline, though. And I think that the fact that that that software engineering and program can be can be leveraged in in every discipline at this point, we just became attracted to me. So I ended up kind of dabbling with a couple of courses and really fell in love with it and ended up pursuing. Bachelor's degree, a master's degree, and certainly that's how I paid the bills ever since. How about the start side of things like you know, coming out of MIT with a pure science degree of bachelor's animators right lot of opportunity. So why go right into startups. Yeah, well, I, I mean, I've had the great honor and pleasure of working with my co founders at pilot Jeff and C.M. for 15 years at this point. We met in MIT's computer club, the student information processing board, CIFB, MIT's computer club. And our first company out of school was centered around Jeff's master's thesis. He had worked on some very, very, very, very fun kind of deep tech for re bootless kernel updates on Linux that we built totally bootstrapped into a profitable company called case wise. That was ultimately acquired by Oracle. But you know, it's incredible, honestly, to think about from where I sit today. Like the fact that we, we happened to meet each other through the computer, the computer club and and have just had such an incredibly productive relationship ever since it just it seems so blessed and and fortuitous. But it, yeah, it just kind of happened, Jeff's like, I've got this technology. We think we can productize it. We're like, let's, let's do it. Let's make, you know, we have nothing to lose, you know, fresh out of school. We have like no money. We have, you know, we, a quick sidebar. I, I, I was a technical advisor to the HBO show Silicon Valley, if anybody has seen it. And a bunch of small like narratives in, in the show actually come from our experience building case wise. Like we, you know, we were like running the company out of this disgusting apartment in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where everybody lived. And it was very formative, wonderful initial startup experience. Also, just like the complete like kind of Wild West fresh out of school experience too. Yeah. So we just, we decided we were going to do it and we did it and we've been together ever since. Oh my God. I will come back to that as well, because that's something really unique. You filled three companies now with Jeff and was seeing him and it does sound incredibly magical with these very humble roots that you've had. With case mice though, you were acquired by Oracle, I believe. So what was that experience like being acquired and then deciding again that you would launch out like what happened during that period? Yeah, and the Oracle acquisition experience was funny because Oracle is an enormous company. And so like they've developed an acquisition team that is able to ingest like two billion dollar acquisitions. And then they kind of apply that machinery towards also like 13% startups. I guess before we get to the actual acquisition itself, you know, I think when we were starting, you know, case mice is a very exciting, interesting, deep technology, but ultimately for a pretty narrow audience, the audience is basically companies that have a lot of computers who for which downtime on those computers is problematic. And so this could be if you're like a hosting company or a super computing cluster. I mean, nobody wants to be the person who's like the super computing cluster is down for maintenance. So, yeah, they're like high need in a relatively niche market. And I think if that is the shape of problem you're solving. Being there's only so so much you can grow like you kind of you have to have a plan for what's going to happen at the end of the day and you can stay independent if you can turn that into it. If you can keep it a standalone profitable business, but I think an acquisition is always a pretty likely outcome for this, this shape of company. And so we I think we knew that that was that was probably always on the horizon. And you know, who was going to be the acquirer we didn't know if front ended up being being Oracle. Oracle treated us very well through the acquisition process and the time that we spent their post acquisition. But the acquisition process itself was was very funny because there were like there were more people on the acquisition team at Oracle than there were like employees at case why I think actually the number of team leads on the calls with us exceeded the number of employees at case wise. Yeah, although one thing just to like tie this back to pilot one thing that they actually called out from us during the acquisition process was this the state of our books. Because we encounter the thing that that that every founder and small business owner encounters, which is like you have to take care of your your finance and accounting needs at a minimum for compliance purposes, like you have to file taxes and that file taxes, you need books. And also, hopefully you actually want to know how much money you're spending and making to like make decisions with business. And you know, we we had like who are you supposed to use. To solve those problems there's like no clue that you know at the time there was no clear best in class solution to this. And so we did a thing that a bunch of business owners do, which is. We bought a copy of QuickBooks for dummies and we bought a copy of at the time QuickBooks desktop because QuickBooks online did not exist. And we also, okay, the thing that was maybe a little unusual as we wrote some software to like auto reconcile our books ourselves. But we kind of built up this machinery to close the books ourselves. And the Oracle team was very impressed by our fast cityness with this. Which maybe was like a premonition of things to come. So that problem had been unsolved for us when we were starting that company. So we did it ourselves. And yeah, that set us up for the rest of the journey to what pilot is today in a sense. That's that's such a great story. You know, we never quite know that the things that we might do that are small to make our lives easier ultimately become the thing that we focus on. And we can never quite predict the future, but when we look backwards, the tapestry reveals itself. So thank you for being so sort of colorful and detailed and sharing that story. However, between Oracle and pilot being founded and you had another chapter in there. So what was that about? Yes. So we had a had a good stand at Oracle. It might have been a year in a day. And then we kind of reconvened in one of our living rooms, knowing that we still had some startup left in us. And we, you know, we wanted to think about is there another problem that we think needs to be solved where we think we're the right people to solve it. And we ultimately ended up building you so taking some funding for and building kind of going into beta with getting some some customers for a company called ZULIP like to loop with a sea. That is actually kind of like slack before slack existed. Now we've probably mostly heard of slack and we probably mostly have not heard of ZULIP. So that tells you something about kind of the outcomes for this, but actually some of the ideas in ZULIP around like kind of threaded chat have the sort of now exists in other systems in a way that's satisfying to see. But this this came out of again our own kind of lived experience as as collaborators in a business context and feeling like the tools that existed at the time we're not meeting our needs in particular if you wanted to have substantive conversations over chat conversations that you could you could go back to as kind of a repository of useful information. If you wanted to do that, you needed more structured information in in in the chats themselves and and so we we built a like a business chat solution around that that idea. Um ZULIP actually lives on today interestingly like it's it's it's like the well, um ZULIP was ultimately acquired by Dropbox as part of Dropbox is interest in being a more foregrounded application for how businesses collaborate to get work done together. So kind of part of a thesis for Dropbox that has included other acquisitions. It ended up being the case that there was a fourth there was a fourth co founder, his name is Tim, um, who actually got the it for ZULIP released by Dropbox and he continues on today was ZULIP as a very robust open source project. Uh that that has like a like a support you like a company built around support for for that open source chat product. So ZULIP lives on today, which is also very gratifying to see with a like a very healthy kind of open source contingent behind it. Um yeah, so it's a little bit of a corporate Dropbox and uh spent a while a Dropbox I was there for I think three and a half years myself, um, Jeff and we've seen were there and. And um did get back together circa early 2017 and said. One more time there's like what one more time we really this time won't tackle a large market. Um with the goal of really seeing how far we can take this was was solving a again a business need like really really reflecting on what has changed what hasn't changed over the past 10 years and if there's a real acute business problem that we're well positioned to solve given our experience. And that's how pilot happened. That is that is so cool. Let me step back for a second so it's been you Jeff and was seen and we sort of naturally fallen into being CTO, CO and CEO and yet you were all I believe computer science and or electrical engineering majors so all of you had gone through that sort of technical experience. How did you figure out that those are the roles that you would take like what was the process for that were there like ways of working that didn't work that were informative and then it seems like you guys have this incredible magical way of working now as a result of having gone through many iterations so maybe you could share a little bit about that journey. Yeah, and you know that that stratification had happened very early meeting at case players was seeing was the sales first like he was the sales person. And today, you know, I mean everything kind of rolls up to the CEO technically but he really lives in on the demand side with sales and marketing Jeff really lives a GNA and I really live with R and D and ops. I think it really it really it comes from our our personalities and interest with seem is with seem love talking to people he loves talking to customers he loves sales Jeff reads corporate tax law for fun so he's kind of behind the scenes kind of GNA operations kind of person and then I've You know, I just I've always loved that being on the product side on the technology side and I think that's been really gratifying at pilot is actually really leaning into the operations side of things as well. So we have these phenomenal teams doing the monthly close tax prep CFO AP AR etc and really supporting those teams working with the software to deliver the service has been has been a really interesting texture on top of just like a pure software business so I really enjoy that personally but yeah we you know we kind of it just kind of happened it even really just that case flies you know what scene was doing sales Jeff was taking care of a lot of the kind of legal back office stuff and I I stayed kind of stayed on the R and D. And it served us well I think I think you're incredibly fortunate because you all had sort of natural kind of ease and that was very clear that's not always the case right you might have two founders I have over laughing skills speaking of which I'm actually really curious you know one of the questions that we always sort of talk about and sort of discuss and explore is you know are there benefits and disadvantages of co founding and are there benefits and disadvantages of be going solo so here's what you thought I mean I think you have a bias obviously but like you know are there are there downsides to co founding is there hard are there is there anything challenging about that. Well so So first like why do you start of not work out maybe the number one reason is probably your your night not tackling a market or a problem that you can actually build a profitable business around can't get traction around But a pretty common follow up to that is is is probably around founder dynamics and like issues with execution that come off of the founder dynamics so I think it's super important that that that a founding team and then as you grow the broader executive team you're building out a well-rounded team that's very high trust is very values aligned and where folks have clear swim lanes. So that's super important if you like don't think that you can do that it may be being part of a founding team is like not the right plan for you. Being a solo fan people I mean people do it all the time and I mean my hats off to them because it it seems very hard. Partially because when things aren't going well like especially if you're pre product market fit you just like don't even know if he's going to work. You have like nobody to you know be depressed with about it and and there you know if you're down your co founders can bring you back up and if they're down you can bring them back up and having someone who's really there there with you on it. Certainly has been so important to me personally in these experiences across these companies that's just me I mean everybody's different so clearly there are many very successful solo solo founders but I think having having folks to share in the burden with has felt pretty important to me. Let me take it a little bit so you've been together for 15 years as this incredible team what happens when you disagree like do you have like a sort of ritual sort of a way of making decisions or like what happens. Oh yeah and I should clarify it like and Jeff would be fine with me saying this because I've said it in front of him before Jeff and I didn't get along for like the first seven years of our relationships as like kind of business owners together and you know I think what that speaks to is that I mean a lot of what what running a company is about is about just interpersonal stuff and and that's something that you get better. You know what I mean you know where we go? Some of the most things are sort of kids are at over time like you this is like a muscle that you practice. One of the most transformative experiences that I had as an adult was actually at Dropbox in an executive coaching program that they they kind of deployed with various departments, including the and you know they run you, they you sit in the fire with with with with that type of executive coaching program like that you get a bunch of like very detailed you know it's like they send questionnaires to everybody who works with you like your manager your peers people who report to you like everybody gets like a 200 question question here where they're raiding you on a five point scale on like every possible attribute of your leadership style and and then an executive coach distills that into themes like where are your strengths what are behaviors that are not serving you well or not serving you well anymore and you like process that together and then you decide how you want to come up the other side of it but you know those types of reflections they make you a they made me sorry I say miss at least for me it made me a better leader but it also made me like a better partner in my personal life because it really forces you to reflect on how you engage with difficult situations they engage with conflicts so yeah I mean it's like a it's a it's a it's a continuous investment in oneself and the team to be better and better as a as a people manager and as a leader that have that that was a really transformative experience for me and I think I benefited from it you know coming into uh coming into pilot because I you know that that's an experience I hadn't had in the previous two companies I just really touched to share that because uh I personally went through something very similar and it was super eye opening just having that feedback come back and then eventually working through for me I am incredibly conflict avoidant if I could I would just lie in a cave uh and then I realized over time and through a lot of coaching and continuous development um you know like you spoke about like conflict is not always bad right I think sometimes we have this perception you know as I was going up it's like oh conflict is not a good thing or like culturally it's not a good thing and yet it's kind of where the good stuff happens it's like when people are able to be sort of compassionate and respectful and laid out table you may find better solutions and better outcomes from it and um yeah I like I I talk about this because I think especially for students um sometimes there's this desire to go solo because then you'll have less conflict but actually you know we're missing out on some great great interactions and great opportunities to develop yeah absolutely and then you go back to your kind of direct previous question you know I was like how do we resolve conflict well first we've done a lot better at it because I think we've we've mostly kind of sorted out our our issues over the past 15 years and it so if you're if you're coming at it from a place of there there there is sincere mutual trust and respect and you know for me it's like I had hang-ups about feeling like I had earned my place at the table right and and so like challenge it things that felt like they were challenging that made me react in an encounter productive way when I have it was I work through those things it's like oh okay we're having a disagreement like we're about three people we both trust each other um let's make sure that we're working off of the same fact-based here like maybe that's maybe that's the issue so like let's make let's check if we're if we have the same information and if we do great um we probably have two reasonable opinions that just happen to be different and we just need to make a decision about you know who's late who's call is this because some things are my call they're in my they're in my kind of sphere some things are you know Jeff's call some things are what seems call and you know you can really you can like pull the card if you need to say like hey this is a deal breaker for me but otherwise we're making a hundred decisions every day like I I'm not gonna microman I don't have time nor the interest to micromanage everything that these folks are doing they're highly capable they're better than me at their this other they're doing so let them do what they're doing let me do what I'm doing we'll make sure that we're aligned on on the big ticket items for sure um and then you just let it go you like disagree and commit let's move on we've had a million other things to do I love it I'm gonna say that again let it go disagree and commit and I think that was probably the hardest lesson I had to learn in my early career is it's just very hard to like go especially when we're smart people who have a lot of education we want to get things done and so letting go disagree and committing because we just can't do everything ourselves and so thank you for sharing that reinforcing that message and I know it might seem awkward in the beginning to do that but then it's like oh you know what we're going to you know when the war and not like scrimmage over this battle right it just makes sense in the long term to have that more star and know where we're going all right let's bring it back to pilot uh you have had a ton of experience already this lived experience of being challenged with uh small businesses with accounting um tell me a little bit more about the early days of pilot how did you go through to figure out your product user that uh what was that experience like and did you reach out to networks to learn more about other small businesses and then how did you crystallize the first couple of product features and products in the portfolio yeah so when we were deciding what we wanted to do next you know what were the parameters on this we we knew that we wanted to solve a business problem we we like don't have a consumer bone in our bodies we're just we knew that we live in business land not consumer land so we knew we were going to solve a business problem the businesses that we understand the best are small businesses and startups because that's what we've done primarily uh and then we also had our experience with our previous companies and and this observation of there there's no clear best-in-class provider for bookkeeping for other financial services um and that hasn't changed over the past 10 years which is like the word that was the thing that was mind blowing from like 2008 to 2018 or I guess 2017 um and also we can sort of observe that there's kind of a rising tide of businesses financial platforms moving online you know it's like yeah your pay of course your payrolls online now of course your expense reimbursement system is online now of course you like handle your vendor payments online now and so everything is you know moving towards these electronic formats you can there are APIs there's structured data that you can manipulate and software great um against that we uh we did a lot we we figured we'd interview it a bunch of people basically like we we we talked to a bunch of people in the back office of various small and their market companies legal teams accounting teams HR teams what have you where is the pain like where is the pain where are the problems that haven't been solved yet and I mean the the unambiguous loudest theme in that research was on the finance and accounting side and it like in particular the monthly close getting your books done like maintaining your books is a nightmare for small businesses um and so that was that was a good foundation like our art it's like our own experience triangulated with this feedback from other people who have this pain and then you can triangulate that with the market and you look at the market the size of the market is staggering fun fact about one in every hundred people in the US does bookkeeping like fuller part time like if you walk down the street and you like you pass a pizza shop and a nonprofit and a startup and a you know a dentist off it like somebody is toiling in the back office trying to solve this problem like denovo for that business and that is simply not the way that it's going to be forever the question is who's gonna make that not be the case um and it has a convenient property if you're trying to build a business which is again it's basically legally required it's not a nice to have it's a it's a it's a must have and so you have this and it it applies to every business like every business has to probably taxes every business has to be the books so if you do the market analysis you're just like it's like a staggeringly large market so if you can be successful even with it a small percentage of that market you'd built like a hugely hugely successful profitable public company and we're all like very pleased with ourselves um so if you take all of these things together you know so like the market size the market analysis our own experience and the talking about validating our experience against other people that pointed us towards the financial back office and then our initial wedge into that was bookkeeping specifically as a very as one of the earliest highest trust relationships that businesses tend to start with a third party provider okay i got to ask you the recursive question do you a pilot use pilot for yourself oh yeah oh for sure first off doing bookkeeping without piled tools is not very fun so i yeah so no we definitely use pilots to produce pilots on financials which is yeah it's like important dog fooding but also is um actually is better than doing it any other way that's awesome that's awesome so um maybe i could dive into a little bit that you had touched upon you really enjoy the r&d work you really enjoy the technical work with you've been increasingly also enjoying um this part of the work that um really is about ops and people and i was fascinated by your philosophy of people plus software and so you've made this decision to also include this community of dedicated finance experts um while automating as you said earlier a lot of the bookkeeping functions and the county functions in the first place so how did that decision come about and how has that evolved yes so so uh i mean one of the very earliest observations was that businesses don't want to buy more software they want their problem solved uh so in general folks are not interested in like yet another tool that they need to like set up and manage and like use day over day or month over month to accomplish some finance or accounting task they just want to know that the problem is solved by someone they trust who has their back if they have questions so that they can uh like a focus on you know you start a business like bring something into the world right you want to mostly focus on that so for the parts that are kind of the low level kind of compliance oriented parts let somebody use better than you do it and how they do it almost doesn't matter like the fact that we use software to accomplish this and that gives you a better work product and like these insights that you don't get anywhere else that the how behind it almost doesn't matter what you care about is the end result which is like you have great clean books useful insights and you have like a person who you you know when you trust you can ask questions of and then on top of that though we can also be the strategic partner to you like a person who can get on the phone with you and help you plan and make better decisions about your business based on the data and based on data that you know we're aggregating that nobody else is going to have access to so it was always going to be people plus software and the interface we solved the problem for you we're not selling you yet another tool that makes sense that makes a ton of sense so instead you'd created a subscription model it's not just purchasing the software itself it actually always comes with a a a financial advisor who you can trust to help you interpret the results and I think that's such an important theme because I see so many companies out there that are like we're going to build you dashed words that will give you insights but it's hard most people don't know how to read data and most people don't know even how to interpret insights or so having that that human touch really really does make a big big difference one the the dashboards are only as useful as the quality of the underlying data and that's the other place where people can get pretty tripped up like if you don't have if the books aren't accurate what the dashboard on top of them gonna tell you spot on spot on well you know you've been at pilot now you're running this company let's see me Jeff for five years I believe so you've built this incredible team so lots lots of individuals and I'm sure you've been involved in hiring a lot of people as the company has grown you have a very very particular philosophy around this and I was hoping that you could take some time to share what that is because it really is unique and you're really at the forefront of that yeah absolutely so well I mean while being a real like while being a realist about why we do this like why do I work so hard building this company and it you know a lot of that is about the economic upside of having a successful startup right for sure you know taking that as a given another thing that is really important to me is the tremendous opportunity and I would say obligation that you have as an employer you know there are a lot of decisions that you're making explicitly or implicitly through the way that you hire and the way that you conduct yourselves you know as a company and you know in support of employees at the company and so I take that I take that responsibility very seriously and so you know our company values the way that we think about kind of the employee life cycle and supporting employees the way that we think about our recruiting strategies they're all an extension of like values into the world and so you've got you you have values whether or not you say what they are and so you know being is supposed to about them and then you know living up to them is really important to me. I think one one particular aspect of this that you and I talked about before so just maybe to highlight it in particular is one of the one of the things that pilot it is maybe most known for on the hiring front is kind of creating space for and changing the narrative around hiring folks you have records into the all these I mean great phenomenal tech jobs that have great benefits and great pay and all this career growth potential like it's like the economic upside again of being at a tech company is so tremendous and can really change the lives of people and their families and so making sure that we're intentional about being a place where folks from a wide range of backgrounds including folks who are formerly incarcerated can can like get in the door and be successful is really important so we've done a lot of work on on yeah so kind of hiring and supporting folks with records and and this is across a bunch of different functions of the company like folks in engineering like folks on the operation side support sales like really everywhere and it's it's not it's like it's not like it's an act of charity it's like we find think these people are really good at what they do and you know your loss if you other companies don't recognize that there's all of this talent that may just not pattern match super easily against the the ways that folks have hired into the tech industry in the past so that's super important I don't know if you have specific questions about this but have it to talk in more detail about it but that's really important to me it's important to me because it's the right thing to do but also because it's actually good for the business it's so so wonderful and so beautiful that you do that um how do you find your way into that sort of work yeah I mean was it through the volunteering and send content that you learned about the population and got to know individuals was it through something prior to that yeah I mean I think everyone everyone has their own journey into caring about the kind of carceral state but yeah I mean I think that this started for me with an interest in the law and how the law impacts our lives and I first started volunteering at San Quentin kind of under under those auspices um but what you know what happens is you like you you you're going inside of a prison regularly you like meet a bunch of folks who are like super smart super talented or in some cases they're gonna need jobs at some point and you're like well heck I need a salesperson I need an engineer like I need a you know a customer support person like would you like to I like it it would be my pleasure if you if once you get out you could work uh at this company because we we're absolutely in need of talented talented folks like you so I think it comes from like who do you know like who who are you in community with who are you spending time with um and realizing that uh there are tons of super talented folks who happen to currently be in prison or who who maybe used to be in prison and this is you know outside of pilot this is this is like a very central uh kind of part of my my my my life outside of work they're they're you know I run a house for folks who are recently out of prison who uh like need transitional housing but maybe can't afford housing on the open market um there's a very amazing and that that houses like is like run by in four folks who are formerly incarcerated at let no cost uh there's a phenomenal group of kind of current and aspiring software engineers called underdog devs uh where we're we've like built up a community and like a stipend program to help folks um pivot their careers into software engineering if you know coming from a background where you face a tremendous employment discrimination usually if you if you have a in particular felony conviction um on your record and so kind of creating the space in the support network and like a referral network to help folks land jobs um through through that community and again what's important about that is again it's kind of buy in for folks who are formerly incarcerated so like really centering the folks who are impacted and the strategy and and like the work that is done so I like a lot of my time outside of work is spent on prison stuff uh but I it's it's it's it's wonderful that it can be connected to the work like the work at work and the work outside of work are deeply connected in that it's like spending your time on extending your values into the world while also building a really great business and that that's been like a deeply satisfying um dimension to my adult life is being able to keep these things all connected I am so glad we took time to dig into the story uh it was the one that actually attracted me the most to sort of explore this topic and uh it's hard to bring uh our life life with our work lives and when we can do that it we're really really fortunate so the final question beforehand over the students and we actually had a trip on this one monday we discussed this at length and then we voted on it uh i'm not going to share with you what the students had voted on but we're curious like if this year third start up if you're willing to talk a little bit about what you see for the future at some point in and you've raised 160 million um the investors you're looking for their returns what does that look like what does the exit look like yeah well i think this goes back to you know kind of what what is the shape of the company what's the business model what's the size of the market that you're tackling and we were very intentional in starting pilot about tackling a market of a size where there was a very i think clear strong path to staying independent indefinitely like building out a suite of products uh that allow you to continue growing as an independent company indefinitely and so i certainly think the most likely outcome for pilot is that we you know stay independent we IPO and you know at some point i'll retire at my full-time job will be in decarcerating California but for now i'm very very happy uh continuing to be at the helm building this really remarkable company with this incredible group of people well we will all be cheering you along and hopefully you might hire some of our students at some point for internships and whatnot so uh with that um super super super thankful for the conversation we have a ton of questions uh we're going to go into student questions now let me start with let's see i can organize through this number one uh what are pilot.com's core values you said that whether or not you state them uh you know you're gonna have a lot of so what core values and how do they contribute to the work culture and ethos yeah um so we we do have values and you know i'll tell you what our actual company values are and it that's like the maybe not the totality of the story right you know there's a lot of texture to folks you know hundreds of people coming together to work uh together and collaborate every day but i'll i'll literally just tell you what the values are and and then maybe like kind of why they are there um and i think the the theme the the meta theme for the values is that you i think you'll see that it's very rooted in um quality and collaboration and like wanting to do the right thing by each other so the first value is care more than they expect and that's true about how we engage with our customers that's true about how we engage with each other uh with candidates um but but care more than they expect and create delight through through that care build trust through that care um get the details right um another value is do it well or don't do it um which could be a little that that one can cost that can start some some some arguments sometimes but uh you know it's important to focus uh you know maximize uh your commitments behind what what actually matters the most and and like actually follow through on them build it well if you're not really hitting the mark with like the core value prop the core thing that you're trying to do um it being distracted by other things is not going to help you so you know focus on what matters do a while i don't do it uh the next value is fix the systemic issue yeah um so you know every failure is an opportunity but only if we take the time to learn from it um especially in the work that we do which is like kind of complex often very subjective finance and accounting activities um you know if some if you know if there's like a mistake somewhere it's it's basically never someone's fault it's like could we have built a more resilient system make it easy to do the right thing um yeah so make sure that we're being rigorous in our root cause analysis and make sure that we're fixing the systemic issue uh the next value is there aren't that many more i promise um the next value is share the work and the win so it's only as success if we get there together um you know have each other's backs be a helper um and take the time to celebrate together and then the last value is seek justice so use pilot as a platform to actively correct injustice in the world wow the last one is like front and center when it comes to the the work that you do within carcerated that's wonderful you think that in very very deliberately yeah and I think what's important to highlight about this is like pilot is not this is an incredibly high performing team like the the team at pilot is so phenomenal like across all of our departments and incredibly high performing team and incredibly successful company on an incredible trajectory we're not it's not like we're making it compromise here it's like doing the right thing is a part of being successful and I hate it when folks try to you know if people try to imply that's like not what's going on sometimes it's like hey no we're great and we're a diverse and inclusive team and we have all of these people from a wide range of backgrounds that have come together across disciplines and you know it all comes together um it's not like we're making trade-offs here so I'm very very gosh about that I think it's amazing you've almost found this like secret right there's this incredible population of folks that very few people tap into because of whatever reason right you know like social reasons or you know um risk reasons or whatever might be and yet um you've harnessed that and you're helping others also harness it over time so it's win-win it's it's a it's across the board as you said um people just don't realize it and you you've uncovered it all right next question the question is did you ever encounter opposition in your decision to hire incarcerated folks and how did you overcome that basically no honestly uh uh you know there there were seven turtle discussion kind of setting up the framework for how and it's not just about hiring it's like let's make sure we're actually setting folks up for success and like we have the internal infrastructure to do that but I think once we had that commitment and like what what what precisely would we be worried about here because if you you know they we're interviewing someone there's like our full interview process the same that we would with anybody else you know we're we're evaluating someone on what they bring to the table as who they are today not who maybe they used to be um so what's uh you know what's the issue yeah I think there can be some theoretical like PR concerns here and it's like uh suck it up it's gonna be fine and it has been fine like there's there's bit it's been totally fine we've all we've succeeded in doing a hiring a bunch of really talented people and that's been like the consequence what let me ask like a sort of a follow a question of that why are other companies so hesitant or why can they also uncover this incredible sort of population of those sort of incredibly smart and talented uh what I think some of it is around bias that is rooted sometimes in in like bad in like bad data or bad information like you like maybe beliefs about um recidivism rates or what have you they're like frankly actually just they're just wrong like if you you know I think I can I can be very confident from my my personal experience but also from the data with let me tell you I've had way more like issues with you know uh some new grad misbehaving no offense to folks in this group that then like a person who did 20 years and got out on a life sentence after a commutation like it no contest where the issues show up in the workplace so you know you what is it's like you what's this really about you're bringing together a bunch of people to be adults together and do work together every day and like so every once in a while someone's like not gonna work out like for you know for like performance reasons or you know they do something that's inappropriate or you know some kind of misbehaving or we're have you and you that's like why you have an HR team and you have good policies and procedures and you don't build a company you know we're nothing bad ever happens but you know you're responsible about how you you know evaluate folks you bring into the company and then like you react as responsible adults within clear frameworks when there are issues and then you're just people doing a job together I love it I love it I think it's important to actively counter counteract bias because it's implicit and sometimes we don't even know it and I think you sort of cracked open to make it much easier and safer to hire a diverse and the group of folks and on board and ensure success regardless of background so you sort of set the stage for that and made it a lot easier to do it's right and that's not always the case everywhere all right next question what are some of the biggest differences that you can remember between starting your first startup out of college including fundraising development hiring management etc versus pilot now yeah well I mean it's definitely easier if you've done it before in a bunch of ways like you know having a successful exit makes fundraising much easier you know it was it was it was it was it was we're fortunate we're so fortunate but what you were fortunate at fundraising for the second company was relatively easy coming off of the success of the first company doubly so for pilot coming off of the second acquisition um so some like the credibility that you you you gain um from those experiences for for fundraising also for hiring you know oh hey these founders know what they're doing like they've done this before they're gonna build a responsible company you know it helps with hiring as well and then you also just like you've done the mechanics before you know it's like setting up the infrastructure for a company you've got you know you need to incorporate you know comp vans and you get like a stock compensation strategy and you administer payroll and you know when a toilet gets plugged you got to shovel it because no what else is gonna do it because you're a 10 person startup initially like you you've done it all before and and it's easier to do it again so I think just like the wisdom of having done it before and being a little bit older makes everything easier we really do a lot of toilet plunging though and the early days if you if you don't like view that as part of the purview of a founder you maybe what you want to be is like the first engineering hire and maybe not a founder um because you're the shit umbrella which is good I like being the shit umbrella but it's not for everybody maybe not every day maybe there's also a lot of joy in it but you know you know uh I think sometimes we forget that um startups are not that glamorous right there's so much of it like there's so much work I work so hard but I love what I do I love who I work with the upside in the success case is transformative and that's that's you know that's why I do it all right maybe the last question I get to ask the final one after that um in hindsight one can justify that everything happens for a reason if you could go back in time we'll take five years to when pilot was just started are there any are there anythings you would go back and tell yourself to do differently yes uh yes I'm thinking about if there are any that can be explained in a way that's not super in the weeds um uh things that I would probably want to discuss with myself from five years ago uh you know everyone always says pay more attention to pricing and packaging than you think you need to and then nobody ever does so I we should have not that we made any huge mistakes here but some some kind of expensive lessons around pricing and packaging that I think we would go back and and revisit um I think um maybe on the operation side building out uh some of the leadership team earlier so that some of like we could delegate to experts more earlier I think might have served us well for making sure that we're kind of building the right scalable infrastructure from the very beginning the the way that the company started literally Jeff was saying when I did the bookkeeping manually for our initial customers when we had no software and and we actually have stayed kind of shockingly close to the the details on this in a way that has served us very well in some ways but um you don't ever want to be a bottleneck like you as an individual don't ever want to be a bottleneck on your own um the company's growth so I may be a little bit of reflection on building out the team on the right timeline to to really be able to delegate out the expertise we did a lot of things right I think uh and so I have a lot of very positive reflections on you know we it like COVID was like a sort of a weird black swan event for for businesses and we we weathered that remarkably well due to some choices that we made around kind of managing burn and being smart about fundraising timing um so there's a lot of stuff that I look back on and I I'm like really proud of the discipline that the team had that gave us optionality to navigate COVID in a smart way but those are some things that I yeah I would reflect on pricing and packaging so everything is pricing and packaging it don't don't ever underestimate it all right final question since we went back five years let's go back to freshman year if you could tell yourself one thing when you were a freshman at MIT what would that be I mean in a sense I it's like I wouldn't change my life for the for anything the way that's played out and so it's like buckle up it's gonna be a fun ride I mean maybe I would say that chemistry degree you're not really gonna use it that's my baby what I would tell myself but I don't I don't know what I would I would hesitate to to to tip over anything that might cause some some weird sequence of events to happen differently such that I you know wouldn't have met Jack and we'll see when I did the entrepreneurial thought leader series is a Stanford E-Corner original production the stories and lessons on
