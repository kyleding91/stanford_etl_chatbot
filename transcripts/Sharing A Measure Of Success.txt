 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader's series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Today we have a very special day. We have two guests who will be interviewed by Steve Blake. We have Rashmi Sinhan and John Houtel who are the co-founders of SlideShare. This is a business media site for sharing presentations. Rashmi is the CEO and John is the CTO. Steve is going to get to the heart of what it means to be partners and running this business and especially as a Mary Cull. Thanks Steve. Thanks Tina. So the first question is Rashmi and John, for the two people out there who don't know what SlideShare does, maybe you could just give us a brief description of the product and the service and website. Sure. So SlideShare, the core idea of SlideShare was that it would be the YouTube of PowerPoint. And that was the three-word description that we wrote when we were making up the PowerPoint of the product. And we shied away from using that description when we were pitching it to Michael Errington and to journalists and people like that. But it turned out that actually being able to describe what you do in a very short, crisp way, even if you refer to other sites that already exist, is perfectly fine, healthy, good way to communicate. So the YouTube of PowerPoint pretty much sums up what we are. Now obviously we handle way more documents than PowerPoint now. We handle PDFs. We handle videos integrated within PowerPoint. We handle audio. And we have a lot of business features as well. But the sharing of presentations online is what SlideShare is all about. Got it. So today the sharing of presentations online. How was your original idea? Was that it? Or was there something else when you ended up there? What was the impetus for the idea? So the original idea was to share presentations online. And it started off in a more narrow sense where we had the realization that John had the realization at a conference that there were sites for sharing pictures, flickers, etc. And there were sites for sharing videos. And you basically watched people pass around presentations on the USB keychain. And he said, OK, let me find the flicker for PowerPoint and realize there wasn't any. Yeah, I wasn't just even watching them. They kept on coming up to me and asking me how they were supposed to put a PowerPoint file into a wiki. And I was sure there would be four or five sites like SlideShare out there already because it seemed like a very natural idea. But we googled and googled and there was nothing like it. So we knew that we had to try. So was this a technical hack by an engineer or was this a business from the day you had that observation? What were you thinking when I assume which one of you was the coder? Were you both co-ed, John? So when you coded it up, were you thinking you were coding a business or solving an individual problem for you? We were definitely thinking of it as a business. We just didn't know that much about media businesses, which is what it turned out we were building. So we were actually running another company at the time. And we had a software, a consulting business based around a software. The company was called you, the Anter, and the software called MindCan with it was for doing game-like surveys. And in the process, we'd built up a product team and we kind of itching to do something larger and brainstorming ideas. And basically, we have a third co-founder and the three of us would discuss ideas all the time. And John used to keep on pitching us ideas. So he would come up with ideas and pitch us and be like, no, not that one, not that one. This was the first idea that we immediately agreed that this made sense. And we looked back at our lives and thought of the many times that it would have made sense instead of sending someone a 40-meg file to actually email them a link. So the use case seemed very simple. And that's what we started from. We were profitable at the time with this other business. So we didn't need revenues immediately. So the first, but we believed right from the beginning that there would be a business here because of the nature of what we were doing. But the first, when we launched it, we were focused on users and gaining traction. So, Amen. You had an existing company that was making money. And you had this idea and you pivoted or you just shifted from the existing stuff to here overnight or did it take a while or did somebody kind of say, well, let's do this as a science experiment and how did that work? So we launched and it immediately took off. I mean, I distinctly remember that it was October 4, 2006. It was supposed to launch, we thought, at 6 a.m. PST. But we didn't realize that when media people talk about time, they're always talking about EST. So it launched at 3 a.m. PST and we suddenly woke up and the site was live and we weren't quite ready yet. And... We had that extra three hours. It's been completely different. But the fun is the most interesting thing was that we had to invite only site because we were concerned about how much traffic we would get. There was these stories of sites getting taken down. So the first thing we did was we had these thousands of people trying to join and we were accepting each of them individually. So everybody in the team, the five of us, are sitting there and saying, yes, yes, yes, except this person. And the first thing we wrote after launch was a check-all button so that you could take all the screen of people and check all and let them into the site. That had incredible ROI. And you just mentioned something I didn't realize. So when I heard you talking about a company, I assumed you had like 100 people. So it was five of you as a company. But it was profitable and... Yes, it was profitable. We were doing well and that's why we had enough bandwidth to kind of say, let's try this thing. And so how long did it take before you realized that maybe this new thing is actually kind of the company versus your existing business? So slight share the site launch in October 2006 and we incorporated it as a business in May of 2007. So eight months? Yeah, so I mean, we were doing well. We were really growing. But at the same time, we had enough revenues to keep up. We were very scrappy. We were kind of a lean company. We've been... Yeah, we didn't want to pay the money for the lawyers. And so when you became slideshare from five to how many? Well, it took a while. So we became... We incorporated a slight share and then we said we'd realized by that time we needed to look for funding because we were growing faster and we could keep up. And it still took us a while to actually close down the other company. And it was a very emotional decision. Yeah, you would talk about Pivot, but it's not so simple. And we realized when we went and spoke to our lawyer and we said, okay, we're incorporating a slight share. And then he took a look at our situation which was we had this growing site and we had this other business which we were all kind of into as well. And he said, you're going to have to close that down in order to really give it this a chance. And we came back, we were so depressed. It was really depressing. Yeah, we had to kill Mike Canvas. Yes. We were very sad. And so when you started slideshare, did you... I don't know like your existing business, did you have a revenue model or a business model on how to make money or was it just we're going after users or users are grabbing this out of our hand, we'll figure it out later. What were you thinking? We just knew that there was this big social media explosion that there was all of this sharing, there were all these examples of these other sites and we were... We were imitating. So we didn't really think very hard about business at all. We thought only about traction. But how do we make this site really, really big? And in retrospect, I think that was exactly the right thing to do. I didn't have the model to think it through while we were doing it. But media businesses don't make sense at a very low scale because you have to go out and sell advertising to somebody. And nobody wants to buy 10,000 impressions of random stuff or even 10,000 impressions about something really specific, like a really valuable topic, like virtualization. That's just not enough to be worth the conversations that you have to have to sell the advertising. So you need to get up to fairly big scale before you can start making money off of running something that's analogous to a radio station or a TV station. So you now mentioned media business a couple of times. And so in your head, you now have a model of what a media business looks like. Maybe you could expand on that a bit and help us understand what that business model is. Sure. Sure. So there are big brands out there that are trying to get their message across. And what they're trying to do is they're trying to reach particular audiences. And you can either describe the audience by using tools that measure the age and the demographics and the interest. Or you can say it's this type of media and obviously this type of person is interested in this type of media. And if you can build up enough traffic and you can build up enough content around those topics, then you can actually afford to take the time to make phone calls out and have phone calls come in to the kind of people that make the deals from doing large scale brand advertising happen. And so is this large scale brand advertising your current business model? Is that? One leg of the revenue. I would say it's a more complex equation than that. That's one of the things. But the first thing that we really got to go. So is that the first business model you had was? Yes. Well, the first one was AdSense. AdSense doesn't really pay the bills. OK. Yeah, I mean, it doesn't. So you can say that it's a very good idea to put it there for a few reasons that A, your users understand the fact that you're making with them, which is that they will be advertising on the site. And for that, you will have access to it. So it's for free. So it and we'd washed when Flickr tried to start advertising maybe in year two or three and then they had this huge negative reaction. So you sure from day one? Yes. Flickr was never able to do advertising because they didn't get their users used to it. Got it. So your goal was to train your users that this was an ad supported site for them. Correct. Yeah. And even now we have, you know, and now we are rolling out a bunch of services, you know, which are business services for the kind of audience that we have put together. And in my mind, what's the media business? Yeah, it's getting, you know, some way of getting the content. And for us, we don't produce content like a TV show or a radio station. Instead, we motivate. We build a service which is so simple to use that users come in there and share their content. And we give away that platform for sharing for free and help them get their content across. So in a way that the way we think about slideshires that we always focus on our users as long as we make them happy and we make them want to come back to slideshire again and again. We are doing our job and, you know, it's a row. And so when you started, did you have to do much active acquisition of users or was just the viral takeoff like Twitter and Facebook? Or did you actively go out and acquire users? It was viral. But it was, you know, Twitter and Facebook have become much bigger in the past year and a half, I would say. We started three and a half years ago almost. So at that point, it was blogs, you know, people. So there were phases. The first phase was that right from the beginning, we were a utility and we were very strong utility. There was no other way of getting your presentations on the web at that point. So you came to slideshire, you uploaded your presentation within a minute, you could take the embed code back. Well, the embeds were like advertisements for slideshires all across the web. So then people would click on the link. The only thing we ask you is that there's a small button at the bottom right of every presentation which has the slideshire brand and the link back. So we got people to that. So that embed code actually was a non-obvious invention. I mean, whose idea was that? One of you two need to take credit. So I didn't know it. No, I don't. I don't remember actually. So one of the things that happens in Silicon Valley is that you have all of these experts in various domains that are right here and are willing to participate in exchange for equity rather than for cash. And that is obviously huge when you don't have any cash to pay people with. And so among the other expertise that we bring into our team this way, there is an SEO guy that we work with who in conversations with him, we came up with the idea. Because that changed the nature of acquisition. All of a sudden instead of just using the site as a place to store presentations, you now can actually display those stored presentations on your own blog and generate traffic from that blog users site by having them click on the slideshire logo. We had that working from day one. So that was the basic nature of the service. Was that you would come in, you would upload, you would take it back to your site and then we would get a link back and they would be word of mouth. And basically you have users in wave. So the first phase of the way is these content creators who come in and who get from word of mouth they find out about the service they upload their content. And these were people from all over the world, predominantly outside of Silicon Valley. So this wasn't like a sort of Twitter or Flickr, you know, tight jeans wearing like early 30s demographic. All those wearing tight jeans were a sure hint. This was much more like, I don't know, sort of very, very sort of web oriented people from very different walks of life. So I remember there were a lot of preachers uploading their PowerPoint to slideshire. From day one. On the first day. And I didn't even know that like people gave sermons using PowerPoint. That was kind of a mind blowing thing to me, but apparently that's the way it's done now. The sermon on the mountain 12 for the slides. Is that not the interesting? Yes, it's the 10 bullet points that be too many. It's actually a pretty popular category. So eventually you guys got large enough to attract not only angel money, but venture capital money. How did that happen? And what was the mutual interest between you and the feces? Well, I mean, as John says, we went kind of in stages. So we, at one state, we decided, okay, this is going to be much bigger than we can make it in an organic manner the way we've been growing. And we need to get some outside funding in. And then we brought in advisors and then a bunch of angel investors. And pretty soon after that, we did a series A. Do you want to? Yeah, well, just drilling down on that a little deeper. The weird thing about Silicon Valley is that your first investors are possibly your lawyer, which is not true anywhere else, but it's definitely true here. If you have an idea and you're building a product, you're going to have to start a company. And the smart thing to do, and what most people seem to do is they go to one of the sort of top 10 firms that do the startup legal stuff in Silicon Valley. And it's very easy to figure out who those companies are, those firms are. And you say, this is the company that we're starting. This is the demo of the product. And it is really like pitching an investor. You need them to have faith in you because what you're asking them to do is to essentially give you services that you will pay for when you raise your series A, which is, isn't a high level of confidence. I mean, on the one hand, it's $25,000 of services that they're set up to crank through relatively quickly. A lot of it's being done by TEMPS and legal secretaries. But on the other hand, it is stuff that they usually sell. And so convincing the lawyer is sort of a first step towards having social proof. And social proof is important because as hairless monkeys were not really good at making rational decisions. And so the way that we have adapted to make decisions is by paying attention to what the other hairless monkeys are doing, assuming that there's some wisdom in the crowds. So is this hairless monkey fundraising or social proof fundraising or? Same thing. Same thing. So social proof fundraising? Yeah. Social proof fundraising is probably better than hairless monkeys as a brand. And is that a term you kind of used to describe what you guys did? Yeah. And basically, each, you know, at the top are the venture capitalists. And they all just are very insular and they all kind of hang out with each other. And it's hard to jump directly in there as somebody who doesn't have a lot of connections. So what you need to do is work your way from the outside to the inside, it's like layers of onion. And the lawyers and the advisors who are getting stock in exchange for, you know, a little bit of their personal brand and some advice from time to time are the first law that is a layer. And those are people who are not actually putting money into your idea. They're just putting their own efforts into your idea and associating themselves with you. Just to put that, what he's saying into context is that even though we were in located in Silicon Valley, we did not have a huge network of investors and the kind of people who build companies. So we're kind of coming out from the outside. So for us, the big thing we had was slight share. I mean, you could look at the numbers and you could see that the site was taking off. So that's what we, you know, in fact, our first angel investors like Mark Cuban, Jonathan Abrams, Dave McClure, all of them we met on slight share. So basically, you know, at one point when we decided we were going to raise money, we emailed some of our users who we knew were angel investors and they were the first people to invest in site share. Did you go by the most popular number of visitors on the slides or? No. No. Did you actually look at the content of the slides and decide they were the most people? Some of them had popular content. And so when you met your VCs, I assume you went through a couple of VC firms before you found the ones and who was your, who were your, to Ben Rock, invested in that? And so what did they see? Did they see the same thing you thought you saw it or did they see something different? I would say yes. With them, they saw the same thing and there was instant recognition. In fact, we used to, we kind of, we didn't really articulate it as a media business at the time. And when we described what we had and where we were going with it and what the larger vision was, what we were building for, then they kind of recognized the science. And they immediately were able to say, oh, this is what you're doing, this is how you should end. There was instant kind of connection there. So it went from just the two of you and three other or three founders and two employees of five person company that pivoted and then you got funding and now you're growing. But I'm kind of interested in you guys and who are you? Where'd you come from? And you mentioned now a couple of times that while in Silicon Valley, you were Silicon Valley outsiders. And so I'm, tell me something about each one of you. And how did you become entrepreneur? So I have a very random path towards entrepreneurship. I actually got a PhD on my way to becoming an entrepreneur. So I was at Brown University and then I was at Berkeley doing some research and while I was doing research, I was doing research in cognitive neuropsychology. So I loved what I did. I was studying Alzheimer's disease, understanding the brain, fascinating stuff. I absolutely loved it. But at some point I realized that the problems of the web were interesting me more. So I started consulting. Left you to Berkeley, started consulting. Did that for a year and a half? You Berkeley, that's a small college of norms. Not Stanford, sorry. And at that point, John was, he was working at Commerce Fund and he would like maybe describe your path to it. And then we started working together. So we didn't start, we didn't begin working together. We just kind of started collaborating on the project and then that project turned into our first software. Yeah, she landed a gig. At eBay. Yeah, it was basically, it was ridiculous. It was basically redesigning the entire information architecture of eBay. It was a huge, huge project that she managed to land. And so I just started helping out with that because it was there. And it was very clear to me that there was a software product in the approaches that she was using to solve the problem for the customer. So I'm just kind of interested. You have a non-traditional background. One is traditional for entrepreneurs, yeah? Yeah, but well, you know, I, but- Then go to Stanford. No, I'm actually interested in- You're getting a bit of this degree. In the brown background. You didn't have Andy Van Dam. Did you? I did. Does everybody want to- Andy Van Dam is a very well-known graphics professor. So, but I was not in that department. So we have a funny story. So we met at Brown. And I was doing, I was in the cognitive psychology department and doing my PhD and just took a class in computer science or two just for the heck of it, you know, just kind of to learn a little bit. And that's when I met- And that was Andy Van Dam's class that we met. Sure. And I was taking the class too and she was definitely the hottest woman in the class. And so I knew- You're filming this. I knew I had to meet her somehow. But this- And this was in the old days before everybody had a cell phone. So that was the only reason this approach worked. It was cheesy, but it worked. And I actually took off my watch and hit it in my pocket and then I went up and asked her what time it was. And she told me what time it was. And I won't go there. So did having a PhD and not going to get to you in a second, Jonathan, having a PhD do you think help her hurt being an entrepreneur? You know, I never really thought of it that way. I've done different things at different points in my life and loved whatever I was doing at that point. And in some ways having a PhD did help. I kind of have the scientific temperament. I like numbers. I really enjoy numbers. I like experimentation. And I think a lot of the ways that modern web products are built is through a process of experimentation, you know, hypothesis testing. I mean, you talk a lot about that. I mean, that's what I did in my PhD with hypothesis testing, you know, and then figuring out what the data shows and then moving step by step. I learned a lot about people, you know, how to understand people. I still think that's what we are building. The primary problem is understanding what are users want and making them happy. So I don't know. I mean, I don't know what I'm going to do next and I'm very comfortable with that. I have no idea what I'll be doing in five years. Does the speed of the startup differ slightly from your PhD research? Oh, absolutely. I think that's the reason I left academia. Because I did not like the speed. It's too slow for me. And your end product is writing. And, you know, I can write the blog or two, but I can write academic papers. I suck at it. So this was better. Definitely the pace. That's a technical description for less than an optimum. So this was definitely much more my speed. I like it. I'm an impatient person. I'm always looking, you know, to the next thing to go on. And this is your first CEO. Yes. And so what didn't you know when you became CEO that you wished, and you could keep the list to about 20? Where were kind of the top three things that you now know or learning? I mean, I would say a lot of things. I knew how to build a product. I didn't necessarily know how to, you know, run a company, the entire thing and watch it grow. And for every day is a learning experience. I mean, I would say the list of what I don't know is much larger than what I do know. But the only thing I really know is how to learn. Yeah, how to figure out what the situation in front of me is and try to get better at it. I can see when the far we see in the audience, I didn't know how to run, you know, do the board meeting and stuff. There were a lot of things I didn't know. So this is a typical example of a founding CEO, entrepreneur's technical team. Is there a book or how did you do this? Is it friends or network? How does an entrepreneur anywhere learn how to run a company? I would say everyone around you, the advisors, people on your board, you just ask a lot of questions. And I think what they are able to give you, which I find very valuable, is that they're able to spot the signals and see the patterns. For people who are good, they're able to tell you what stage you're at. And these are the issues you are seeing and this is one way to deal with them. I mean, I think it also gets down to the Silicon Valley magic again, which is even as sort of semi-outsideers, you can connect networks of people that have been through the stuff that you're about to go through. So right after we launched, I was freaking out about operations. How do you keep a cluster of servers up? We'd never had to do that before. And I was able to find eight or ten people who would have been through exactly what we were doing, walk me through what tools they used, what worked, what didn't work, what problems you don't have to solve. One of the key nuggets was that in that early launch phase, when traffic is growing like crazy, you don't even really need any alerting because you are somebody from the companies on the site at all times looking at it. So if something goes down, you'll know it because you'll be experiencing it. You're so passionate about it. So Jonathan, that brings us to you as CTO and co-founder. What was your background? I heard you were also at Brown, but were you in the CTO founding track as an entrepreneur? Sure. So I was a computer graphics geek at Brown. Andy Van Damis, one of the founders of computer graphics, did a lot of the work. And my first gig out of school was working at Advanced Visual Systems, which was a scientific visualization. And then the computer graphics started in Waltham outside of Sposton. And that was really cool. And that really matched with what I had done in undergrad. And then when Rush Me Got her postdoc at Berkeley, I had to move to Silicon Valley. And I was like, that's okay. But as I started interviewing and asking around what was happening, a lot of the people that I knew in computer graphics were saying, this was 1998. They were saying, there's a lot of people making a lot of money doing business stuff. And so I thought, well, a lot of money is kind of interesting. And we're an advanced engineer. And I ended up getting a job at this outfit called Commerce One, which was B2B startup. And that was just an incredible experience because it was maybe like the stereotypical sort of .com experience where way too much money got thrown at something that everybody was really excited about. Well, and I joined that we were like 125 people and we grew to 4,000 people. And now there's nobody. There's nothing left. It's just all completely gone. But it was this very exciting curve. And in the process, I got to see a lot of people making a lot of mistakes. And that was very helpful. Do you think that was your training for getting it right as fine-cher? What do you think in your background prepared you for being an entrepreneur? Sure. I think really the first entrepreneurial experience laid the grounds for the second one, the initial product that we did, Mind Canvas. Really, it taught us a lot about how to manage people, how to iterate, how much software to build before you release something. I think we made the mistake of building way too much software before we actually started trying to sell it. It taught us how to sell. And that being able to sell something is very important. I mean, the great thing about that first product was that we started out with something that we knew that Rushmaker sell. And the first time that we ran the software, we made $15,000. It was a while, it's larger, before we made $15,000. It's very different experiences. So yeah, the initial experience with Mind Canvas was definitely laid the grounds for us to make that pivot into slideshare. Interesting. And can I assume you two are a couple? Is that it? Yes. That doesn't mean introduction. Fine. I just wanted to check, just between us, no one else is listening. Because that brings up an interesting question about obviously the relationship at home and the relationship at work. I mean, this is a 24 by 7 activity. And how does that, how do you manage that? I mean, do you ever talk about anything else than the slideshare? That often. No, we actually took our first vacation after a long time. And it was awesome. It was really good to take a break. And I feel like the company has matured enough that we could do that. I think, as I say, you have to work closely enough with your co-founder that you want to like them enough to be married to them. And I think it's true. You really have to work very closely. And this makes it easier for us. We actually like each other, even after working together all the time. I think getting close to your co-founders kind of a good description of this relationship. But how do you settle? I'm sorry. How do you settle? Convert. So we do have a lot of disagreements. I mean, it's not as if we agree on everything. And I think that's very healthy. You know, like, you don't want to start up everybody's agreeing. You want to, you want healthy disagreements and people to have different points of view. I don't know how we settle it. I mean, technical stuff. I decide business stuff. You decide. I just say for it. No. I'm actually not sure. I think it's just issued by a show that we come to. We also have a third co-founder and we come to consensus. I think we do kind of talk about things enough that we understand each other's perspective. There are some times when we just have one pet idea and we go ahead and do it. So numbers. Yeah, it's like 1% time, right? Yeah, numbers. So I mean, partly, you know, if John feels very strongly about something and I don't agree, you know, and I don't think it's a great idea, I think a lot of times he'll try it anyway and then do a first pass. And then, you know, look at the numbers and then we'll prove to each other. Well, look at this, this worked. I think it's interesting, you know, working together and being married together and for us, it wouldn't be any other way. I can imagine for a lot of couples it doesn't work. That's an amazing story because I could not imagine doing it. There is a lot of power in being able to just have a very high bandwidth connection with the other person that you're working with. You wake up and, you know, that thing that you've been processing in night about the business that the idea has come to you is immediately into the other person's head. And by the time you're in the office, like you've already pushed that idea forward two hours, it's pretty incredible. But it also is exhausting. And do you think there's any downside for the company and having a couple running the CEO and CTO? I think if you get caught in emotional stuff and you're not able to make decisions that are good for the company, then yes. I don't think that's the case for us. I don't think it interferes. I think it helps us. Yeah. And basically you have to keep it professional. So, you know, you have to, you have the way that you are in the office and the office contacts and the way that you are at home and they're different. Well, just a segue back to something you said earlier about strategy and your experience in that. It's like you're about strategy or is it about execution? It's about both. I mean, it is about both, but I would say that it is surprised to me how much, how important execution is, you know, and you can have all this in Silicon Valley. You meet a lot of very smart people with a lot of great ideas. And very few of them have the patience and the kind of persistence, the metric-mindedness, all the things you need in order to actually make it come alive, watch it every step of the way. So, it's both, but there are phases when one is more important than the other, you know, you kind of have this grand vision and you start laying it out and then for a while it's about, it's about, you know, your execution and then you have another thing that you're doing and then it becomes about vision again. And so, what was the hardest execution? Let's take you, John, for engineering, then you had to do it so I'm sure. I mean, so I think just the raw scaling of the site was incredible for challenge for us. I mean, we get 25 million visitors a month. It's just this huge torrent of traffic. And we run on a very modern infrastructure that's based on the assumption that you have lots and lots of computer time to waste and the developer time is more productive. I think you guys actually, DHH came here last week or maybe a couple of weeks ago, so you heard from the master. DHH is. David Hammer, Hammer Schmidt. Hammer Hammer Hammer. Hansen, there we go. So we run and Ruby on Rails and Ruby on Rails eats up a lot of compute resources. And so figuring out how to run operations and having to learn that very quickly when it's just three guys who know how to program but don't know how to do that kind of thing was very, very challenging for us. And we struggled a lot. I think we're over that hump now but it was for a solid year, it was something we really had to lean on. So for you, execution was immense scale in a short period of time, not being a scale domain expert and figuring out how to bring that expertise around you and into the DNA of the company. Absolutely, absolutely. But I have one other point about execution versus strategy which is if you're doing your execution right, hopefully it should generate your strategies. I mean, all you have to do is have, if you have some smart ideas and you're executing right, you should be able to test them with enough efficiency so that the ones that are working will manifest themselves so that you'll get proof that this strategic idea that you had actually has legs and is worth investing in. And was the same execution problem or focus there on customers and users on the business side as well? Let me think about what has been the, I don't think it's a single particular thing. I think the scaling thing is definitely something that everybody in the company will resonate with a big challenge for us, which you really don't face in the beginning and then you suddenly start facing it when you're starting to grow. I don't think it's one thing. I think it's a lot of in terms of execution. Something that it's hard is getting people to stay focused, getting the entire team to stay focused on the problem, doing, I think it's very exciting to build new features. Everybody loves to build new features. And it's harder to just make that work day in and day out, be metrics driven. That part I find is, find it hard to kind of drill that into the company, not just do it myself, but to get everybody in the company, that's the way we think. Tell me about metrics driven. It's the first time I heard that. What does that mean at Slideshare? So what that means for us right now, for example, is that for most of the important projects that we do, the different parts of the application, we have a daily email that comes in and we've identified what the main things we care about for that particular part of the app, we look at it. Kind of like a dashboard. Kind of a dashboard, but you don't have to go to it, just comes in your email to everybody who's working on it and then we react to it. So we do this pretty much every day and different frequencies depending on how fast we are moving. So you've instrumented the important parts of both your site and your business. Is that true about users and customers? Correct. And also the technical parts as well about that. Absolutely. And one of the key insights that we've had is that metrics are very important and I think executive dashboards are kind of bullshit, frankly, like the idea that there's like one executive who's looking at a dashboard. For less than half of them. And it's going to be making the decisions and then there's a bunch of worker bees who get assigned task, one, colon, C, dot two and execute it and then it meets this back and then this strategy guy says, yeah, it's good. I think the numbers have to be pushed down into the team and the team has to be empowered to do things that will drive the numbers. And what you find about that is that the ergonomics of metrics are really bad. Like if you use Google Analytics and you tell an engineer, okay, so you have to, this is how you go to find this funnel. So you can figure out what conversions are like and whether his numbers are doing well or badly. And there's six clicks and it takes two minutes to get down there. I mean, he's already hacking 55 hours a week, 60 hours a week, building important stuff, doing incredibly complicated things. He doesn't have time and he doesn't have the inclination to go munking around. So it needs to be ambient. It needs to be like we have LCD screens in both offices that show the charts of the statistics that we care about so that you can just glance over me like, what is happening to CPU? That's crazy. Without having to go and log onto an application and look things up, the emails serve the same function. They make it so that the numbers come to you rather than you have to go to the numbers. I think that's really important. And do you iterate quickly on that use, right? Yeah. So, you know, for some of the business features that we are working on right now, we iterate every day. You know, every day, you know, actually yesterday I told my engineers that the email comes in at midnight, which means that I have to wait up till midnight every day to look at the numbers before deciding, you know, what we are doing today. So I said, you know, can we have it coming at 9 p.m. so that I can go to sleep a little bit earlier after having looked at the numbers. So we iterate daily on a lot of things. Yeah. We deploy maybe 10 or 15 times a day to the site. So the code is constantly changing. It's constantly more fun. And since you guys are kind of now at the leading edge of some of this social media trend on the web, what do you see emerging? Any future trends that are just clear to you that the rest of us should know and you don't have to tell us what your secret sauce is. So any insights about how the web is shifting? So we're definitely looking at real time very closely and I think, you know, everybody's talking about it. So it's not a new insight I'm bringing you. But I do think that what real time means for different domains, you know, that's what we are thinking. What does it mean for a slideshare without going into details about what we are thinking about? Definitely, I think that is, you know, different apps will become real time in different way. Just move faster than we move right now. And that's going to have a huge impact. I'm interested in being about the now. Yeah, it's about the now. And slideshare now excuse the pun. In the last month, introduced channels to the public and you've also now have a focus on business. And do you want to just close maybe just telling us your latest? Sure. So, I mean, that's, we have been building up to this for a while. So in the last year, the biggest thing that has happened to us is that we have a lot of more businesses and organizations joining slideshare than the earlier we had individuals. Now, it's a lot of business and organizations. And the latest feature that we have launched is for, it's called branded channels. And it's basically recognizing that when the company wants to be on slideshare, they want to carry with them, they're branding, they look and feel and kind of have it be an extension of their site. So we launched that. It's doing really well. We have a bunch of great organizations, some of some companies and some people like the White House is on slideshare. Internet is on slideshare. There's a lot of great content if you go to slideshare or net slash channels. And you'll see a lot of other things that we're going to be rolling out, which I once again about this recognition that there's a lot of business usage of slideshare. So can the Republican Party buy ads on the White House channel? No, they can't. We take off the ads. We take off the ads. There's no ads on any of your content. But there are paid channels. There's paid and some of them be giving a bit of free. So it's not as if the government agencies are paying us. But I think one of the important things about the channels idea is that like a lot of the other things that we've been talking about, it emerged out of our interaction with customers. So we didn't just think, oh, like let's build some channels, let's devote six months of engineering work to building channels because people want to brand its base. We sold branded spaces to multiple organizations. And we realized that there was actually demand for this that we were not supplying because we were just doing one-on-one sales of this higher end product. So we productized it and then we released it to the public. So it was informed by our experience trying to sell things and having success at it. And are other products going to come out of that process as well? Yes. Right now we have three business services that we've launched. There's channels. There's lead share which allows you to collect leads on your presentations. And there's ad share which allows you to promote your presentation in a contextual manner. And we are building more and then some new things about the current funds. That's great. So before I open it up to the audience, what questions should I ask you guys? What would you like an entrepreneurial audience to know about either you, your company or more importantly the entrepreneurial adventure that you've been on? I mean, I think just an important concept to get across is that a lot of times getting into entrepreneurship isn't just a jump. It's a pivot. And a lot of times there's multiple pivots before you can get to your destination. It's very hard. Some people can work as a full-time employee of somebody and do a startup on the side until they prove that it has traction. I mean the bloglines guy Mark Fletcher did that. He worked for Sun. He built bloglines on the side and then once it was working he quit Sun. It takes a very special kind of energy to be able to do that. When you're working in a professional context in a competitive place like Silicon Valley, it tends to suck up all of your cycles. And you need to get clear of that. And if the first thing that you do isn't necessarily your green product or isn't even a product, if you can just get in the place where you have money coming in the front door that is not from an employer-employer relationship, you're well on your way to being able to do that. So we did multiple jumps before we got to slide chair. There was employee to consulting, consulting to small B2B product and then small B2B product to slide chair. And I think that the ability to do that is important and it's not always. Great observation. Anything else you want to add? I mean I think it's interesting for an audience of people who maybe are thinking about entrepreneurship as to whether what motivates, what motivates one. And I think partly for me it is independence. I do things I enjoy and it's always the case. There's always a new challenge. I think one of the interesting things about a CEO job is it changes every six months as the company is going through different phases and you never quite know what's going to come your way enjoying that part. Being comfortable with uncertainty, there is a lot of uncertainty and you definitely have to be comfortable with that. Yeah. Great. So what we're going to do is for the next 14 minutes open questions to the audience and then after the session, Jonathan and Rasmussen, gratefully agreed to come to our MSN-278 spirit of entrepreneurship class. So for those of you not even the class who have additional questions who don't get answered, you could follow us across the campus and we'll have you join us in our classroom. So let's open it up and questions. Won't you just pick? Okay. My question is kind of at a high level macro level. The social media landscape is changing rapidly. It's like Twitter, I think it had a thousand, thousand percent growth in the last year. And new organizations and big companies are all jumping on this kind of anwag and that's taking off. And a lot of people are comfortable with it and they don't know what it is and what is it going to do for me. How would you tell somebody like my mom, like what is the point of all this? Where is it going and why should I not be afraid? Because I know people who are like, I'm kind of scared of this whole social media thing taking over everybody. For me, one of the interesting things about last year, you know, 2009 was that my mother joined Facebook, which I really hadn't thought it would ever happen. But I sat down with her and I got her onto Facebook and I watched as she connected to one person and then Facebook would keep on recommending other people in her social circle and was fascinating to watch. So I think maybe we play the role of the gently introducing them to technology and it has to be a personal experience. What made it interesting for my mother was nothing to do about social media or something. It was simply the fact that she was able to connect with her cousin and her sister who she hadn't spoken to because she was in the US and they are back in India. So she was just able to connect with people. So it has to be personal. It has to be about the connections that make it interesting to you. I think this in on a larger level describing, you know, what's happening is much to abstract and each person kind of discovers it for themselves. I don't know if that answered your question. Yeah, I think it does. I was just taking about conversations that have recently where people are saying, I'm on all these sites. I'm using them frequently. I kind of enjoy it. But at the same time, it's like demands a lot of my attention. If I don't up to eight, my Twitter, you know, for a few days, I'm out of it. If I'm not on top of everything linked in Facebook and just sort of this, I have to be doing it. Right. And well, that's the reason that, like, you know, Google and Facebook are competitors, right? It's not that they're necessarily in the same businesses, but there's a finite amount of consumer attention that can be spent on all this stuff. Right? And so each thing, each service has to individually prove its value because it's competing with every other thing that the user could possibly do. And certainly with every other thing that you could do on the internet. And that's the biggest sort of point of competition right now. It's not competition for customers or for sales. It's competition for the attention of the over subscribed web consumer. Next question. So how are you doing with competition from Google with a presenter and Microsoft launching on this slide? So Google is not a, we don't consider Google a competitor because they're about, you know, creating presentations and we are about sharing them. And in fact, we allow you to import directly from Google, Google presently to slideshare and display your slideshare. So we think that they can be complimentary as regards Microsoft. Once again, I think we are not going to enter the creation space. We are going to be all about sharing. So we will simply allow you to import from the next version of Microsoft. Microsoft, you know, find slideshare interesting. They have a channel on slide share. If you go to slidehare.net, slash Microsoft office, you will see a lot of content shared by Microsoft there. So you think you guys have got these slideshare, if you had then Google on Microsoft's. It's about distribution, right? Slide share is a place to share your things. It's a way to put it out there so that other people will find it. It's a very different thing from an offering experience, whether it's an online offering experience or a desktop offering experience. They're fundamentally not very related. And we did get a lot of questions, particularly before Google presented launch. We got lots and lots of questions about what the relationship would be, what's Google going to be a big threat. We don't get those kinds of questions anymore. And in fact, we sell advertising to some companies that make web-based presentation offering tools. So it's... So this is back again to your first observation about being the YouTube for PowerPoint. Yeah. That is your broadcast or not a content creator. Exactly. Where do you think about it? Absolutely. That we are focused on the sharing. And we really don't go into the art ring. And we want to be neutral. So we want to be, you know, wherever anybody who creates presentations, we want to be able to take that content into site share. So... Yeah. Can we just go ahead and take a look at it? And there was a... The version there was a slide version, both in the website by Rand. And one of them seemed like to mention something like your site, the one in the show are the slides. So now, how would I go ahead and finish the question these things out? Do you know how to copy the control? Given that you don't have the copyright control. Because I signed the thing saying, you know, why is it not that you're receiving some sort of sound that happens in the world or something like that? So in general, what we ask our users is that you share what you either... You have the copyright for or you have permission from the copyright owner. So we suggest that you share if you have on the copyright or have permission. So I would change a few words and then change the title and all of a sudden... That's what I'm saying. ...using the DA's or whatever. And it's the same paper that it's doing was just... You have not the expert on copyright, but in general, you know, that's... It would be... I'm trying to figure out because, for that, we're going to describe it over here first talking to this board. And they just got so stupid documents. Yeah, they are for documents, yeah. You know, I'm just saying that. I'm more interested in Alexi's slides, although they're leading the audience because they're easy. Yeah, so I think that services are different in the sense that they're focused on writing and, you know, on authors and books. We're not. We're about presentations. Presentations are used by companies, or for, you know, putting across visual, as well as words together. You watch presentations, you read books. So we are... Although we are similar in a bunch of the formats we allow you to import. But the nature of the sites are very different. Different audiences, so depends on which audience you want to appeal to. That's another question. But the complementary. And some people do use them as complementary. Okay. And another question. Yeah. So we talked a little bit before about distribution, marketing, how the embed really helped. King Talk in terms of before the actual launch, in terms of prepping up to launching what kind of steps did you do specifically? Was it just telling your friends or did you kind of had a VR plan set up? Got it. So yeah, we had, as Ruckney said, we had an invite only system. So we started just by inviting our circle friends and seeing what kind of stuff they upload. And in retrospect, we should have seen what was going to come when we put the site open to the public. Because it was not... You know, my idea was larger. It was going to be stuff from conferences mostly. But the second slager that was uploaded with this weird piece of PowerPoint art with photographs of flames and water and poultry. I didn't know if you used PowerPoint or this kind of thing. So we didn't have a closed alpha or whatever you might call it. The second was up semi-functional being used just in one of the people who knew about it. And that was for a couple of months. And that was the point where we were almost ready to launch. Almost ready to launch. And that detail work always takes a lot more time than you think it will to really finish particular marketing experience. It doesn't have to be a whole product. But the part of the product that exists should actually be what it's supposed to do. And freaking it's doing that consumed most of that summer of our six when we had something that said I worked with it. You need to work. Thanks, well done. So I'll sort of hand it up in the corner. Oh. Okay. Move that. Talking about sharing, could you share with those water percentage of revenues or from ad versus affiliate marketing versus business services? To be doing share those numbers. Not the numbers, but just at a very high level. The right numbers should be revenue that are from advertising. Tell me some more of that engineering type of question. So when you were looking at what you're starting to go to the site, it's interesting to show it's ribbon rails because it is known for its like, we get performance versus like high volume, PHP, the don and so can you just talk about some of the decisions you may have are you glad you did that? And would you get, if you know what you know now, would you go back and do anything different? See, that's that kind of thought experiment is very dangerous because obviously if you know that something's going to be successful, you're going to do very different things than if you're in reality where you can't predict the future. I mean, I think that if you ask the Twitter team, you know, okay, you know, this idea that you have, Twitter is going to be a massive overnight. You know, $2 million and six months, build it. I'm sure that they would have made something beautiful and totally scalable and it would have been awesome, but that's not reality. In reality, you release things and there's a 95%, 98% chance that they're going to fail. So what Ruby on Rails really gives you is this ability to rapidly prototype and just pump your ideas out into the internet until one of them resonates and takes off. And then afterwards there's a lot of, you know, refactoring and cleaning and changing has to be done. And it's true that it's maybe not the most suitable technology for a very, very large site. If you knew from the beginning that you were going to be a very, very large site, you might do things differently. But I don't think we would have gotten where we are today if we hadn't been able to rapidly iterate that way. So you have to take the good with the back. Okay. Yeah, next question. All right, one more. Going, yeah? In the back. When you're working on slide share, you must have have a bunch of other great ideas. How'd you pick this one to focus on it? Go forward with it. Great question. And this is where having founders, partners who are smart and take the really days off. I have the idea of that. And I just wanted you over quality with me. So I was coming up with all of these ideas and just wanted to give you an idea of like some of the stuff and the spectrum. Like there was things like, you know, bit toward box that you could sell to consumers who were afraid to install bit toward on their home computer. It was like PowerPoint authoring rather than a social media sharing site. I was getting closer to the presentation idea. Dozens of ideas. And each one of them either were shot down by Rush Me or by Amit or a third Joe founder. And then this idea, I got into conference. I was like, well, I can one shot to pitch it. So I actually spent a couple of days actually designing what it would be like. And I showed it to them. And they were both like, yes. Yeah. But not? Yes. We're going to launch the product. Yes, we're going to dedicate a month of engineering resources to see what we can get. And if it looks like something that's promising. So that was, it was pure, you know, competition in the marketplace of ideas. This was the idea that survived that gauntlet. Yeah, we did have at least one other prototype that we built and then worked on it for a month and gave up and said, no, this is not going anywhere. And then slide share was the second one that we actually prototype. Well, well, guys, I want to thank you for coming today. I thought this was incredibly informative and congratulations with slide share. And hopefully we'll be reading about you at your IPO. So thank you very much. Thank you for coming.
