 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. So today we have a guy who has a love of music like I do. He plays a wicket guitar. I'm not sure he brought the guitar if he did bring the music. But he is CEO of a very important company, Optometica. Why do I say important? And compelling company. It was founded by the chairman of the Optomology Department here at the School of Medicine at Stanford University, Mark Blumincranc. Mark sadly cannot join us today because he's at a conference in Florida, being a professor and thought leader in the technologies and science of this. But he and his board recruited this mark for Shep to join them as CEO from after a long history of being at Alcorn and Alcorn. Alcorn, excuse me, tongue twister, Alcorn and you can see I'm not a medical science person myself, Alcorn. But a long history, that's a major farm company. So he came out from the south where he went to Alcorn and joined the company recently. He's going to tell us all about that and tell us about medical devices. So let's welcome Mark to Stanford University. Thanks. Tom, thank you. Thanks. Good afternoon, Stanford. How are you guys doing? So let me number one, let me begin by thanking Tom for that introduction. And I got to meet Tom in 2007 because his brother, Brooke Byers, is the chairman of our board in Optometica. So I met him that way. But also met him through the Mayfield Fellows program. We actually have a couple of Mayfield Fellows that are with Optometica, the city right down here in front. And it's a fantastic program and Tom and Tina Sayley have done a wonderful job with it. So Tom asked me to speak about entrepreneurship and leadership. And that's exactly what I'm going to speak to you about this afternoon. But I want to make a foundation statement first. And that is that when I was in college, I was an absolutely lousy student. And as a matter of fact, when I interviewed on campus, I developed this kind of novel little technique, at least I thought it was novel. When the interviewer had asked me for my resume, I would flip it over, face down, and slide across the table, say, this way you and I just talk for a little bit. And I tried, because I didn't want to look down at my GPA. And something must have worked about it because I managed to get a great job on campus and that launched my career and somehow I wound up here today. So what I'm going to do today is share a number of things with you about my lessons that I've learned about entrepreneurship and leadership. And as I was thinking about framing this talk, I was trying to think how to do this and convey some things to you that might be really helpful. And there's a great book by none other than Stanford's own Tina Sayleg that is called What I Wish I Do When I Was 20. How many of you have read this book? It's a fantastic book. I absolutely love it. And as I was thinking about how to frame this today, I thought that's kind of what I want to frame as pass along some of those lessons to you today. So I thought what I'd do is I'll give you a little bit about my background. I'll then give you a little bit of background about Optometica. And then some of these crystallized lessons I've learned over my career about leadership and entrepreneurship. So let's get going. And Tom gave you actually a really good rundown on my background. So that was really good. But I was born in South Alabama as he mentioned and I went to school Auburn University. I got a degree in marketing. And I got my first job through the placement center on campus. I interviewed with a company called Armor Dial, a consumer products company. And I got a job as a field sales representative. It was a fantastic, great first job. And I got into it for a couple of years and I really enjoyed it. I learned a lot about business. But you know, I also realized that's not what I wanted to do with my career. I really wanted to be an entrepreneur. And so I kind of squirreled away a bunch of money and after a couple of years in this position. So I went into business with two college buddies of mine that had founded a company called Donnelly Communications. And so I joined them as a partner. And Donnelly Communications was a nationwide 800 answering service. So you look in the Wall Street Journal, you see a full page advertisement that asks for direct response. It has an 800 number at the bottom. And we would handle the direct response. We maintain a call center 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And then we send the leads to the company. And so this was a great experience for me. I learned a lot about business. I learned an incredible amount about sales in that position. But there was one problem. I was absolutely, because it was a boost. We financed it out of our own pocket. I was absolutely starving to death. So I made the decision to go into surgical sales. And I joined a company called Greasehopper. Greasehopper was a, is a fantastic company. And is a 85 year old Swiss surgical instrument company. Handheld instrumentation, kind of the roles Royce of Ophthalmology, exquisite craftsmanship, just astoundly. I spent 14 years at Greasehopper. Stars of Field Sales were representative. I worked my way up. I wound up running the US organization. And one of the great things I learned in that experience, that 14 year experience, is that product development done right by a company working with physicians is kind of a symbiotic relationship that is incredibly rewarding. At Greasehopper, we did that very well. We launched hundreds of new products during that 14 years. And I learned a lot about that interacting with physicians. And I kind of got addicted to it. I mean, it just was unbelievable in terms of personal reward. But so we gained a great reputation enough so that Alcon Laboratories, $7 billion Alcon at the time division of Nestle Now Novartis. Alcon acquired us in 1998, asked me to come to Texas, which I did, integrated Greasehopper into Alcon. And this was a much different experience for me, because of much larger company at the time, I think, sort of like 11,000 global employees. And Alcon was once again another great work experience. I spent almost 10 years there. And Alcon is an incredible culture, wonderful people. I absolutely love working there. It was a place where we had tremendous success. I have the highest respect for that company. And I thought I was going to finish my career there. Massive market share gain. I felt like I had tons of wind in my sales, lots of momentum in my life, in my career. And I thought I would never leave the company. But not so fast, because that entrepreneurial urge was kind of still there. I'll tell you why in a minute. And in early 2007, Mark Blumincran, Dr. Mark Blumincran's at Stanford, approached me. And he said, a company that I founded, Optometica, we're looking for CEO, and you should be that guy. I knew Mark for 20 years. And I was in his great career that people never leave. And I very respectfully, of course, I'll think about it, Mark. And so I was just a little bit being polite. And then Mark sicked, Brubbias on me. And the second that I met Brooke, and I met Craig Taylor. And I met the people at Optometica that I couldn't eat. I was really compelled to make a change. And made the decision to be the Optometica CEO. So I told Brooke when I made that decision, I said, man, 23 years in one place, I'm going to have to clear my head a little bit. And the people here that know me know that I love cars. And I'm kind of fanatic about it. And I said, so when I make this transition, I'm going to drive from Texas, and get my car. And I want to drive down Route 66. I want to drive from Texas to California, take three days, and clear my head. And so I did. So June the 2nd, 2007, I started driving across the desert, kind of racing. I think 84 there was, that was the lowest I went the whole time. But about halfway through the desert, I found myself asking, what is making me do it? Why am I doing this? I mean, this was absolutely kind of crazy to leave such a great thing and do this. Well, there were a couple of reasons. One is that element of being in medical devices, having breakthrough technology, which I'm going to tell you about, was really compelling. And that was really exciting. Optimatica's technology, the stuff that you could see at the time was really exciting. The stuff that was in the lab that was not ready to go yet was incredibly exciting breakthrough technology. So that was one. A chance to work with Brook, work with Craig, work with Mark Blum and Cranzeno Planker, people at Stanford. George Marcellino was really kind of the only guy at the time I knew him in Optimatica. Excited about all of them. But there was another piece. And this was kind of the tipping piece that, as I was driving quite, there were these haunting lessons in life, things that I had experienced that are kind of early age that made me say, I've got to do this. And I'm going to share those with you in a second. But before I do, so the first thing was technology that I had to have that. So I'm going to share with you a little bit about Optimatica. What the company's all about. So Optimatica was founded in 2004. And it was intended to address ophthalmology broadly. These are the founders. Five people has Mark Blum and Cranzen right there. And they intended to address retina, glaucoma, and cataract surgical instrumentation. Fimto second laser cataract surgical issue, a category that had not even existed. So that was really compelling. The very first thing that we did at Optimatica was license pattern scanning laser technology from Stanford. And that became Pascal pattern scanning laser. And it's nothing short of a revolutionary treatment for diabetic retinal disease. With each foot pedal depression of the laser, 56 spots are delivered to the eye, much less power, much less collateral damage, a much more comfortable patient experience. So this was a really fantastic product that really changed the way retinal laser is delivered. And we achieved some fantastic milestones. In three and a half years, we sold 600, more than 600 systems and 40 markets around the world, treated more than a million patients, delivered more than 40 million patterns to patients' eyes successfully. Some great milestones. And that was successful enough that it caught the attention of a distributor of ours in some major markets, TopCon Medical. And last year, in August, TopCon acquired the retinal glaucoma part of Optimatica. So they acquired our only revenue generating business, which was a great win-win because they got this revolutionary portfolio of products. It was great for them. We felt good about it because they were a great partner. We were able to then also, though, turn our attention solely to that FEMTO Second Laser Cataract Project that had been kind of stewing in the background since the founding of the company. So that was a fantastic thing for us. And when we were thinking about FEMTO Second Laser Cataract surgery as that next step, number one, it's a huge market. As anybody in here know, how many cataract procedures are done globally per year? Do you want to take a guess? Quiet room. 15 to 16 million procedures per year. So we're aiming at a really large market. We asked ourselves sort of aspirational questions. What if we could combine innovative imaging with the precision of FEMTO Second Laser? Could we deliver precision and surgery that could improve patient outcomes? Could we change the procedure and improve the visual benefit at the end? And you know what? There's some opportunities because traditional cataract surgery has its challenges. What you see here is kind of the way of procedure is done today with manual instrumentation. So this is a forcibly that the physician punctures a hole in the anterior capsule. And then they manually, they're trying to tear a perfect circle. This is like cellophane. You're trying to tear a perfect circle of cellophane with the forcibly. It's absolutely, it's like the power steering on one of my old cars. It doesn't work very well. So this, so it can be out of round. These are things that you can go out, it can be out of round. It can be larger than the target that you intended. As you're doing this, you might get a big remnant or a tag, or you might be making the tear. And it go, quote, totally out of control in around the equator, which is adverse event. So the reason they try to gain access this way is because they need to get to the cataract in the natural human lens. And they use this ultrasound device here. And they pulverize it into little pieces and aspirate nucleos out. So they chop and segment it. As they do that, they can break that capsule that's on the backside. That's an adverse event. So you create this opening in the lens. The physician then implants an intraocular lens. It's an implant that stays in the bag. And it's made of an acrylic material. And the objective is to have it perfectly seat because that bag shrinks around the lens. But what can happen is if you don't line those up properly, it can go out of sync. It can tilt, shift, the center. And what happens when that occurs is the patient gets less than a perfect visual outcome. So real simply, that's one of the challenges. And that's what we intend to address with the catalyst precision laser system. So this product is not on the market yet, what it's going to be. And this is what it does. It uses precise femtosecond laser to create the circular cut, precise size and shape. It uses femtosecond laser to dice this into easily aspiratable cubes that the physician can use without ultrasound. Makes precise incisions here in the cornea to address the stigmatism. And then it provides multiplying incisions to enter the eye with that ultrasound device. So this is pretty spectacular technology. And we believe it delivers precision that will change everything. Now, it's kind of a big statement. But I think this is a landscape shift in this surgical procedure. By replacing those manual steps, we're going to take cataract surgery to an entirely new stratosphere. I mean, I can see everything getting rethought in terms of the things that are used today, which is really exciting. And I think this is the driver of the new standard. What you wind up with ultimately is this implant with a precisely positioned capsule precise alignment post-op procedure. So that's really cool. So that's what Optometica is thinking about every day. That's the technology. And so as I'm going into work every day, and you have this highly energized team working on this technology working, it's really excited about what we're doing. I find myself constantly every day managing the day-to-day things. And I'm drawing on lessons that I've learned throughout my life. Things that I've learned about being an entrepreneur, things I've learned about leadership. And I say so far, because I'm sure every day, I'll walk away with something else that I learned. So let me tell you about lesson number one. And lesson number one is one that I, is my year between my senior year of high school, my first year of college. And I was a desk clerk in the summertime at a Howard Johnson's hotel on the interstate. And I kind of like that job as a kid, because you got to wear a coat and tie. I thought that was kind of cool. Now it's not. But I was a desk clerk at the Howard Johnson's. And one summer night, car pulls up in front, and this well-dressed gentleman walks out. And walks in, and I ask him to sign in. I put the car in front of him. He reached out and picked up a pen and wrote his name. And he wrote Ray Crock. And I stopped him. I put my hand down. I said, not the Ray Crock that found a McDonald's. As 18 years old as funny, I had some bizarre coincidence. I had just like read an article, like three days before about him. Probably wouldn't have known who he was. But he said, yeah, that's me. And the man I couldn't believe it. I said, what an opportunity to talk to him. So I just hammered him with questions. And so he said, you know what? I'll tell you what, I'm going to go put my stuff down. And I'll come back and I'll sit down and talk to you. Yeah, right. But he did. He put his stuff down. He came back and walked into the lobby, sat down, and talked to me. And I remember this remarkable conversation. And when he walked out of the door that evening, I remember thinking, man, I want to do what that guy does. I want to be a CEO. I want to create a culture. I want to create a company. And it had this huge impact on me. And so the rest of my life, in my work career, every day I'm making decisions. I'm thinking I want to do that. So lesson number one. Know what you want. Set your objectives. I promise you'll achieve it. I promise. Lesson number two, you must have passion. Now, for this lesson, I'm going to go back to when I was interviewing on campus at Auburn. And every week, companies came in and they'd put their names up and you'd see who you want to interview and sign up. And I saw this company, Armour Dial. This was an early 19th, Armour Dial. Wow, I love their products. I want to interview so I signed up. And I went into the interview and shook the guy's hand. I sat down and he started asking me the usual questions. In about midway through, he said, how much do you know about our company? And I said, are you kidding? I love your products. I use them every single day. And he said, really, how is that? And I said, well, every day that I've been a senior here at Auburn for lunch, my lunch has been a can of Armour VN as six saltine crackers in a Miller light. And he kind of laughed and he said, you mean you really eat this stuff? And I said, not only that, I absolutely love it. I would love to sell your product. Now, I knew nothing about sales at that time. Absolutely nothing. But I had a lot of passion for VN sausage and beer. And so that passion got me my job. That was a really big lesson for me when I learned that. And that enthusiasm has a big role in success. Technique, skill, yes, enthusiasm plays a big role. Lesson number three, absolutely no matter what you do, you must learn how to sell. A lot of people think that sales might be something you're kind of born with. You just a natural born sale. Not true. Sales is a skill. You have to learn how to ask questions. You have to learn how to present, identify needs, handle objections, do trial closes. Clothes should be a natural conclusion to a discussion that shouldn't be pressured because that means you probably haven't done it right. It's a profession. And you know what? Everybody sells. You're going to sell. I have to sell to my board. I have to sell to my investors. Sell to the employees. Sell to my spouse. Sell to my children. Everybody that you contact with in your lifetime, you're going to have to sell in some way. It's a great thing to learn. Now, this book, I'm just curious. How many of you have ever seen this book, Countermaster of the Art of Selling? So we got a couple. When I put this up, I thought, man, I'm really old school. This was printed in 1980. But this became almost just like a foundation for me. Three buddies of mine, and I bought the book at the same time. And we made it like a lifestyle. We said, we've got to be unconsciously competent with this. So we all, you know, room together, we had a big house that we lived in. And you said, you know what? If we're going to go to the movie, we're going to have to sell each other, go to the movie. If we're going to go to dinner, you're going to have to sell each other, go to dinner. And it made it, you know, become something that we got pretty good at. Learn how to sell. Lesson number four, there's no failure that you can't recover from. You're going to go out and you're going to take a big swing in life. If you fail, you know what? So what? So you can recover from it. You know, you're going to be in the weeds in your career. And you just need to believe in yourself and find a way to get out. Now I had a really interesting thing happen here when I was with Donnelly Communications, my own business. I was up to my neck in debt. I didn't have a dime to my name. Every credit card maxed out. And nevertheless, I believed in my product. And I said, you know what? I've got to get to ad agencies in New York City. So I drove from Alabama up to New York City. And I was pounding up and down Madison Avenue every day calling out ad agencies. And one night, I went to the Port Authority bus term when I was standing in New Jersey. And I went to the Port Authority bus term when I get to the bus home. I missed it. I didn't have any money to get a bus ticket. And I was standing in the bus station. And I said, you know what? This feels pretty much like failure. Because things weren't going that well. I had no money. And I was in the Port Authority bus terminal at midnight. I had no idea how I was going to get home. And so I started looking around and over in the corner is a guy playing the guitar. Now Tom said, I play the guitar. And I had on a grape in Stripe suit and wing tips with holes in them. And I walked up to the guy and I said, hey, dude, at some point, you're going to need to go to sleep. And when you do, can I play your guitar? Because I need to get a bus fare to go back home. And he said, yeah, sure. And he handed it to me. So I got a bus fare. I made some tips. And I managed to get home. And then three days later, I got my first job in surgical sales. So I mean, it was just a kind of a, I felt like, man, I'm big time in the weeds. But it was kind of a nice recovery. No failure you can't recover from. Lesson number five. Strategy and tactical implementation equals success. Now, strategy is sexy and cool. Everybody loves to talk about strategy. But the rubber meets the road in executing a plan. If you can't execute the plan, it's not worth the paper. It's printed on. Now, there's a great example of this at Alcon when I was there. We had this massive success with the product you see here on the left. And it launched at the exact same time as a product by its chief competitor. And at the time, the chief competitor had the lion's share of the market. And Alcon was kind of the also ran. And five or six years totally flipped the market. And Alcon earned more of its fair share. Why? Well, it was great technology. Absolutely. You can't do it without that. But it was tactical implementation that made a huge difference. We were intensely focused on cut managing customers, relationships, doing the right things every single day, messaging, branding, making sure everything was run like a really well-oiled machine. And that made the difference here. So that tactical implementation, is strategy, equals success. Now, those people here at Optometica get to hear a lot of my sayings over and over and over. This is one of them. The most dangerous thing in the world is a past success. You're still in love with. You have to live like your best day is always in front of you. Have to live for the future and take the things that you've done the past. And they're in your rear view mirror. You can kind of celebrate them for a little bit, but keep moving. And surviving success is one of the hardest things to do. So there's a great example here, if you think about Optometica in Pascal. Pascal, by almost any metric, you look at you say, that was an incredible success. And we were feeling really good about what we had accomplished. And it was a pretty audacious decision to take something and just say, OK, we're going to transact it away. That felt really wild. But you know what? It was because we had our eyes on the goal of the FEMTO Second Laser Cataract System, the huge opportunity. We made sure that we were good stewards of what we had built, put in the hands of a company that was going to execute well with it. And focused on this future potential. So best day has always been in front of you. Lesson number seven. Do it for something other than money. I think if you're focused on money and that's your goal, you're going to get it pretty quick. And money is just the byproduct, I think, of really good work. It just kind of shows up if you do things right. And if that happens really early, then that was kind of a hollow exercise. Having a higher order goal is really important if you want to drive your career and stay challenged every single day and want to achieve. So I'm fortunate to be in the medical device industry because the products that we make impact people and improve their lives and not witness anywhere better than in this slide right here. So when we developing the FEMTO Second System, you do all kinds of bench tests, lab tests, safety studies, all this work to finally get in the clinic. And there does come that day where you use it the first time in humans. And so we set up our clinical trial in the Dominican Republic and we're screening patients. And one particular woman raised her hand and said, I want to be the first. Really? Why do you want to be the first? She said, I want to be the first because I know that if I can help you get this product to market, if I can help you get this into surgery, it will benefit millions of people's vision and it improves millions of people's lives. Now, I couldn't have scripted that better. And you know what? Those are the moments that you work for. That's an incredible, higher order thing to feel with your career. So do it for something other than money. Lesson number eight, people do business with people they like. Great example of this is the top con transaction last year when we transacted away the retina and glaucoma business. And I say that because probably four separate times that I can think of while we were in that negotiation, I felt like we kind of hit a wall. I thought this might tip the other way. This might not happen. And the reason the way that we would get over that is the person at top con that was in charge of it on their side and I would get on the phone. We really liked each other. We both shared the vision that this was great for us and them. We both wanted to make it happen. And we would pound through really difficult issues because we believed that this is good for both companies. And so business is a contact sport. And I would highly encourage you to think about that and treasure the relationships that you build because they're really meaningful to your success. Lesson number nine, prepare, prepare, prepare. Nothing takes the place of preparation. And building a great game plan and executing it is incredibly important. Now how many of your football fans? How many of your Stanford football fans? How many of you? OK. Well, I've never met Jim Harbaugh. But I would bet money that if I met Jim Harbaugh, he would say that games are won by outstanding recruiting, outstanding training, developing a strategy, practicing that, delivering that on game day. And Stanford did a great job of that this year. You guys had a pretty great season. So you should feel pretty good. Now I would be remiss in this conversation if I didn't mention my Auburn Tigers, that, in case you'd hear, they won the National Champions Championship. I love this picture of Gene Chisic, who's the coach at Auburn. And this picture of him with his game plan in his hand laminated. And if you ever dive in and see how they do that, watch film intensely. They think through every single play and scenario so that we're in the heat of battle, they've done all the homework. They know exactly what to do. One of the things I heard Gene Chisic say a lot during the season this year was they'd go in the first half. And they maybe wouldn't have something just right. They'd have to tweak it half time. They'd come back and win the game. The Alabama game was 24 to nothing almost. The half and Auburn came back and won it. So that was a fantastic example of preparation. Lesson number 10, put the right people in the right seats. Now this is kind of my last lesson. And I kind of did these a little bit in chronological order. But this is probably the single most important thing for you to think about as you launch in your career making sure the right people are in the right seats. Now, people in the optimistic here me say a lot, weapons don't win battles. People do. If you don't have the right people in the right seat, you have to correct it. Everybody on the team probably knows that they're not the right person in the right seat. And you know what, it goes further than you might naturally think. It's natural when people hear this statement to think, oh, I need to make sure the people that work for me are the right people. But you know what, it goes way beyond that. You need to make sure you have the right seat in your board. You need to make sure you have the right investors. You need to make sure you have the right team. You have the right advisors. You need to make sure that your friends share your values and that you guys are good for each other. And you need to make the right decisions in your personal life. You know, one of the most important decisions I ever made in my life was my wife and the spouse that I have. And she's incredibly supportive for me. That's an important decision. And that's another way of thinking about having the right people in the right seat. So, you know, I started out here by referencing Tina's book, What I Wish I New and I was 20. So, you know, maybe one day, something really cool happens. Maybe I write my own book and I was kind of thinking what I would call it. And you recall how I started my career. Well, I think I would probably name mine the Vienna Files. You know, people would think this is like a global business book. It's about Vienna sausage. So, the subtitle though, you know, Tina has a really slick one. But mine would be 10 lessons learned during my journey from a tiny South Alabama town to becoming a medical device CEO in Silicon Valley. Where's Tina? Is she, oh, so, what is it? Okay, yeah, so, yeah. So, I need a little help on the subtitle. That's why I'm a medical device CEO and not an author. But that's probably what it would be. So, now, those are my 10 lessons. But I do because I'm here at Stanford today, I do have one bonus lesson for you guys. And that is I look around this room. And this room is full of choices to be made. And if you think about life and you think about as you go out in your career, every day, when you wake up, you get to make a choice. You get to make a choice to work hard, to have a positive outlook, to stare things in the face, not be daunted by them. That's a choice that you get to make. Success is a choice you make. It's a great book by Rick Patino. I encourage you to pick it up and read it. But you also have an asset behind you that's very powerful. You have a very powerful brand behind you in Stanford. So, leverage that brand, leverage your skills, leverage your knowledge, leverage every gift that you have, and go out and do something great with it. So, thanks. So, I think we've got some questions here. And so, yes, thanks. I'll start to explain. As I talked to you before, we have class where we talked about you and the company and the decision-seek. And one of the things we were really curious about is it's very unusual for a company to sell its entire revenue street, basically. And to still remain a company. We were really if you could just talk a little bit about that in terms of what did it do to the culture, did the culture change, did some of the people have to go with the acquisition? Where did the money go? Did you use that money to change out your investor pool? Or if you could just talk a little bit about what went on behind the scenes there and how you navigated that. You know, so let me repeat the question for those of you who may not for it. So, it's a question about the transaction with TopCon. And when we made that decision, what impact did it have on the people? Did people go with it? How do we make that decision? Was it a good thing for everyone? And what happened with the structure of the board and the structure of the company and what else? So, and what happened with the culture and the money? So, you know, it's a really interesting thing. There's not a lot of cookbooks on how to do that, you know, to transact away your revenue stream. And so, we felt a lot of times like we were sort of blazing some new ground. And the first thing is we had to really think about the decision to do that. We really thought long and hard and said, okay, we need to really be successful and focus on this big opportunity that exists in Cataract. At the same time, my management team and all the people in the company were intensely committed to the customers in the retina business. You know, if you think about it, you know, I mean, I spent 23 years in retina. These were not just, these are friends, you know. And so, when a product is in the hands of a friend, you feel intensely responsible to make sure that they're having a good experience. So, we folk, we had a lot of discussions about if we're going to do this and we're going to, you know, succeed in Cataract, we've got to be focused on Cataract. And this responsibility to what we had already accomplished was very dilutive. And every day, I mean, we get in my staff meetings and, you know, we're constantly managing the amount of discussion about retina in this huge opportunity. It's really hard to do. So, we made the decision. It's best for the company to do this. And then we started thinking about all the elements of once we decided to do this with TopCon, we got through the negotiations. Then we started thinking about, you know, that's got to be successful. I mean, we can't abandon the customers. And so, TopCon was very much wanted the employees that manufactured all the skills they had, you know, to go with it. And that was kind of a hard thing to do because, you know what, we're in the right the middle of Silicon Valley. And one of the things I learned really quickly is that people aren't happy with their jobs. They probably go across the street around noon and get another one. So, it was really delicate. And it required a lot of personal sitting down with people, talking with them, you know, making sure they understood. We did things as a company to make sure that it was, you know, it was good for them in a lot of ways. And then we maintained some interaction at a pretty high level through the transaction to make that occur. What happened to the culture of Optometica is really kind of amazing that I remember walking into the office when some of the milestones the transaction were passed. And walking in the office and saying, you know, all I'm thinking about today is cataract. I mean, this is just like incredible, you know, it was like instant clarity. But then what also happens is you get that instant clarity and you also go, man, we've got so much to do it because now you're thinking of it at a deeper level is like, wow, we got a lot to do. And so we had some key objectives and things that everybody had to get focused on and it became just this intense effort, very exciting. But we went from a revenue generating coming to kind of back to a startup, but a really, really well infrastructure startup. So one of the things that occurs is we kept some infrastructure that you wouldn't typically have in a startup. You know, we had some commercial infrastructure that maybe didn't match up with the rent. So we kept that and you know, we're not gonna, we're not gonna change that. I mean, those are great people we were at long and hard to get to. So our board made a great commitment that we're gonna, we're not gonna play to just play in cataract. We're playing to win. And so we kept that infrastructure, the money from the transaction, you know, our board said, we want you guys to succeed and we want you to have everything you need. And so it's, you know, it's date. And it's really a remarkable thing. I mean, I was talking with Brooke. I mean, he's had so many experiences and he said, man, this is like a case study. I mean, it's, and one of the things I'm really proudest of is that the employees that went to TopCon, you know, we didn't, we didn't lose anybody. And that was remarkable. So it's pretty, pretty, is that answer here? Yeah. Okay. Cool. Yes. So this is a lecture on entrepreneurship. You talked a lot about entrepreneurial lessons. But you also said that in your job before coming to optimistic, I thought that you felt like you had made it in your, there for 20 years. So, and you were approached. So do you think that you were in approached and kind of convinced that you would have made a kind of entrepreneurial jump? That's a great question. And I was just talking with somebody that I was trying to recruit yesterday. And I said, yeah, I was kind of a little bit of a, you know, job tree hugger of sorts, you know, that I loved what I was doing. And I, you know, I do have this kind of, you know, positive outlook and I can always find the positive and stuff. And so I, even that said though, I knew that I needed to do something different. Because, you know, with the domestic rent and the business and the economy, we've grown to, you know, market share in like the 80 plus ballpark. And I was kind of starting to, I mean, it was a wonderful experience that I was like today, you know, this year we're gonna go from 84 to 86, okay? You know, I mean, that wasn't this challenging to me. So I was getting a little bit bored. And, you know, that conversation with Ray Crock, I know that, you know, it's just like, it's probably, you know, just a really short time one. That had such an impact on me and it was always nagging. So if you think, you think about the thing where I went from dial to Donnelly, you know, that was a big risk, that was entrepreneurial. Actually, Grease Harbor was very entrepreneurs, a smaller company, you know, and then back to Optometica. If I hadn't been approached, I think I would have probably, within a year or two would have done it. But I don't know that I'd ever have found such a perfect opportunity. I mean, this is, this was spectacular. Somebody else? So I took a question in terms of like the company timeline. Was the sale of Pascal like in the works before you were brought in as a CEO or was that sort of something that you could have jumped to? Great question. And it was not even remotely considered. And I'll tell you, it was, is pretty interesting that we reached the end of, I'm getting my, so we reached the end of 2009. We're going through our strategic planning process. And you know, kind of one of the great things about Optometica is we're like an innovation factory. I mean, we have so many smart people that are so creative, that when you kind of look at our pipeline, it's ridiculous. I mean, you know, and so we're kind of at the end of the year and we're planning out our strategy. It's like we can't do all this. You know, and, but we want to eat. You know, this could be a company and this could be a company and this could be, and so we're thinking about that and it was feeling really funny just letting stuff sit. And so in that strategic discussion at the end of 2009, we said, you know, we got to do something different. We got to focus on cataract and we made the decision in probably a couple of months. I mean, what, like what one, yeah, and it's just bringing on another team to make the business bigger and so retaining the kind of stuff. That's an option, but it would have been such a scaling and we had, you know, the FEMTO Second Laser Cataract opportunity is so immediate and compelling that as much as I think every one of us would like to do that. And I'll tell you, there was one product in particular in the Retina Trans actually. It was in the pipeline and I'll say it was kind of absolutely deep in my heart as like I felt like it was my, you know, my baby or some, is the hardest thing in the world to not take that product to market. But man, I promise you, TopCon will do it and it will be a grand slam, you know. And I'm glad it's in their hands because those are great people and they'll do a great job with it. Yeah. Yes. You mentioned your first patient was in the Dominican Republic. Yeah. Would you care to mention why the Dominican Republic is supposed to say the United States of America? Yeah, absolutely. So the Dominican is the FDA approved site and so we worked with their IRB, their internal review board and gained access to it. We had a great ability to work with a clinic down there that the head of our medical advisory board had trained him as a close relationship. It was secluded, I mean, because we have a project that people would love to know a lot about. It was nice to be able to shroud it a little bit in secrecy and so that was a good reason for it. Yes. As CEO, you've had to make like a lot of really difficult decisions. Like, can you talk a little bit more about how you motivate the people to like stand behind you on all these tough decisions? Yeah. You know, there's a great question. And so I think the only way to motivate people to stand behind something is if they believe in it. And so I try as much as I can to be very open about things that we're doing, why we're doing them. And if somebody doesn't believe in something, I kind of take it as a response, but I kind of want to sit down with them as much as I can and make sure that I help them understand the elements of it. I mean, every decision has some element that is maybe not great. You know, that you can't have everything perfect. And so I think the only way to do that is just with personal contact and transparency and helping people understand what's really driving it and what the outcome of it is, what the intended outcome. Yes. So your first lesson learned about achieving things in your goals. Yeah. Clearly you achieved your goal becoming CEO. I'm just curious how your career goals have changed over the years and that of how you had to change yourself around those. Yeah. So I am a, I'll say, I was a victim of one thing that I learned really quickly. And when I was a starving kid that was up to my neck and death and I didn't have anything in my wing tips recall had, they had holes in them. There was a point that, man, I was pretty focused on money. And I had this really interesting thing that like a lot of good salespeople or whatever, you know, the way salespeople are doing, I had this car that I wanted. So we're back to cars. I had this car that I wanted and I put a picture. I said, I'm going to buy that car and it is really expensive. And I said, so I put the picture on my wall and I said, when I achieve this, I'm going to go buy that car. And I achieved that and I went down to the dealership and I bought it. And I drove it home. It was a, so I'm a huge, I'm a huge domestic car supporter. This was in 1988, it was a Cadillac Alante. It was a roadster made in Italy that was on the Ferrari assembly line, but it was a Cadillac. So I'm a huge domestic car person. Anyway, so I bought the car, I drove it home and I put it in my garage. And I remember getting out of it and going, this doesn't feel good. It's like, man, I worked so hard for this and here it is. And I can take it now to the 7-Eleven and get a couple of minutes. It's not a great thing. So that really made me start turning my attention. And recognizing what I was doing and talking to patients and things. So that was a huge, that was a huge shift. And I guess the other shift was just recognizing the importance of taking a swing. I say these lessons I've learned are in chronological order. And it's because I learned them along the way. Grappling with failure and learning from it and saying, there's a point in time at which I just said, so what? I remember talking with my wife when I was making the decision to come out to California, sitting down and out-carned really to their credit. I mean, I really did a lot to get me to stay there. And I thought it was just the most respectful thing. I mean, I was just kind of appreciated very much. But I remember talking with my wife and saying, you know, we could go to California. We could lose absolutely everything. Or you know, you can stay married to me. And she said, yes, I was okay with it. And we're going. Yes. I was going to have to put in a lot of the right people in the right places. And often that is like three teams, right? The man and the team, the advisory board, the directors, as curious kind of how you want to go out and select the members and each team and then the dynamic between those three. Because you are a medical device company. And your management team has a much fewer people who are bread and butter, hard, and not going to buy a score, right? And I was wondering how the medical advisory board influenced your students. Yeah. So great, great question about the management team. I think, you know, as I think about the senior man, I've hired everybody but one person. And he was one of the founders. And he's one of the guys that I mentioned. I love working with every day. So when it came time to hire those people, you know, it's really interesting. One of the things about Silicon Valley is, I mean, you can use recruiters and you can define what you want. And also this network of people with your investors and advisors and everything. So kind of the word went out that we were looking for people and some great talent came to us. So we're a pretty high caliber company and so people would, you know, hear the opportunity at Optometica for a CFO and somebody at Client Perkins sent us somebody that they used to work with in another company. And one thing about it, because I think this is really important, is the dynamic of the team is really important. You know, you don't want clone. It's like building a football team. You want them to work well together, but you want different personalities and different points of view. And it's really incredible to me that when I sit down and interview, I kind of know in like five minutes. I mean, I know really fast if they're going to be the person. And there have been times that I've interviewed somebody and they just, we've gone through a long series of interviews and something comes out in the end. I'm like, you know, yeah, I move that. Like right up front, something wasn't right. So I think that dynamic is a critical part of it. Did I answer your question? Okay. Okay. Yes. I've seen a lot of stories about inspiring and based on that, it reminds me of the story of Edison when he first uncovered the lamp, the light bulb and the younger reporter asked him, you said, Mr. Edison, that's phenomenal. That's incredible. You finally did it after you failed a thousand times, and he just came and looked at him and said, Yom Ann, I did not fail a thousand times. I just found a thousand different ways that he did not work. It didn't work. Yeah. It's not about failure. Yeah. Just in a way, look at it. Yeah. Absolutely. I've heard that story. I've just thought about it again. Thank you. Anybody else? Questions? Yes. Obviously, I mean, you have great business talent on all of those things, I'll see when you are now. But do you think like you were born like with that skill set, you were going to go into business to become professional CEO, and you think that developed along the way? If you asked my two older brothers, they'd say absolutely not. I felt like I was born, I always felt like I was born with a desire to do something that made a difference. Maybe that's one of the things that's been a driver is there are times where I didn't feel like I was able to leave a thumbprint on something, and those times started making me get bored. It's really rewarding to be able to build or do something that can make a difference, and you can point back and say, yeah, it has accomplishment. That's pretty good. I think that's what has been a driver. I think I was born maybe with just a desire to kind of a positive outlook and a desire to do something. Maybe a certain, I don't really care that I didn't do this part well, we're still going to win somehow. Yes? As I told you before, one of the things we like to do is we like to look at the whole person and understand a little bit about your personal life. So this isn't really a fair question, but I know the students will enjoy hearing the answer. We noticed that you have a budding artist in your family here, and your daughter is a musician and a singer. We're just wondering, everything you've learned as an entrepreneur, are you helping your daughter with her career and what are you learning about that industry as opposed to this instance? Can you take lessons and apply in there? Absolutely. I feel like a lucky parent. I've got my daughter like that. I've got my son's a really kind of gifted athlete that I go watch practice football in a minute. So my daughter is a singer, because I play the guitar. I'm really interested in it. Absolutely. I mean, so the music industry is so different now. She has a website. She makes her own CDs. She writes her own songs. I'm really involved in that. She performs live. And I'm a lot of the times on her backup guitar player. She plays with something called Braden Roses. So she and I, multiple times during the year, we'll go play in drug rehab centers or unwed mother homes. So we go do that and we'll do a set. She's open at Los Gatos, me and the part. She opened for the Jonas Brothers one time. She's really excited. And she's right now auditioning for music school. I probably better not say where. And this was kind of really a big compliment for me is she went. There were 2,200 students that won again in this school and they brought a hundred down and she was one of them. She asked me to go with her and be her backup on the audition. And I thought, well, that's pretty cool. I've never been so nervous in all my life as that. Because I thought, you know, if I mess this up and she doesn't get in that music school, it can be dad, you didn't get me in. But yeah, and actually my wife is amazing with the help she gives her and kind of marketing and stuff. She's got a great agent. She's got the agent that was Smash Mouth's agent. So. What's her name? It's for everybody to check her out. Oh, Alexis4shay.com. Okay. All right. Yes. Looking through your family background and the time that you spent with your children, I was really impressed at how you're able to balance that kind of family involvement along with your personal career. And I just want to know what challenges did you face having to balance that and how you managed to do both so well? You know, I hope I do it well. I try. But so first, I think you have to make the decision to do that. So for example, when it hits, it used to be, I can't right now because they closed the practices, but it used to be when it hit football seasons, my son's football practice. Every day, I would just say, you know what, I'm going to finish up work and time to go watch his practice and go to his games. And because, you know what, I've got one son and it's going to, you know, and I'm not going to miss any minute that I can. You know, so that becomes a decision that you have to make. And you know, so that means I have to get up at five o'clock in the morning and start doing email then. You know, so you just make those choices and then try and manage your schedule around it. As much as I want to do it, as much as I try, there's still plenty that you miss. But those are, I remember there was an instance in our family where we lost one of our relatives and I remember that moment thinking that if my kids come to me and say, hey, dad, you want to toss the football? I'm saying, go put your shoes on. You know, if I'm working and I'm going to take the time because you don't get that back. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
