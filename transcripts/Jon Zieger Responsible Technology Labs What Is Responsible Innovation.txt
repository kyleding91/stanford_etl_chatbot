 Who you are defines how you build. This is the entrepreneur thought-of-the-your-series brought to you by Stanford E-Corner. Welcome everyone to the second of the three special live ETL episodes as TVP is presenting this summer before we kick off the full quarter in late September. I'm Rita Katila, professor in Stanford's Management Science and Engineering Department and Research Director of STBP. Today I'm excited to be hosting a conversation with John Ziegher. John is a co-founder and the executive director of a nonprofit called Responsible Innovation Labs. We are doing much research and teaching on Responsible Innovation at Stanford. And when I heard that John is heading Responsible Innovation Labs, I thought we need to find out more. So what Responsible Innovation Labs does? They are working to create tools and ethics-based frameworks to help technology-based startup scale in responsible ways. Before Responsible Innovation Labs, John was the General Counsel of Stripe where he built an over-sought companies legal, public, policy, and corporate security functions and helped Stripe scale from a very small startup to one of the largest Fintech companies in the world. Before Stripe, John spent almost a decade at Microsoft where he over saw the legal functions for Microsoft's certs, advertising, and other online properties. Welcome John to ETL. How's your day so far? It's good, Rita. Thanks so much. It's really good to be here with you. Thanks for joining us. So first off, since Responsible Innovation Labs is such a new organization, we wanted to ask you to spend just a few minutes talking about how the organization got started and the problem that your nonprofit is trying to solve. So Flores yours for a few minutes, John. Super. So thanks for that. And again, thanks for having me here to talk about it and you're right. It is a little hard to find information. I'm going to share a quick deck which we'll just kind of touch on. Let's see. So Responsible Innovation Labs. Let me start with Rita's detail, a little bit of the origin story here. And I won't kind of go through all of the numbers and details on the slide, but maybe start by a little bit of story or some context. So when I left Stripe in the beginning of 2020, I started the period after taking a little bit of time off. It started a series of discussions with former colleagues, friends, people that I had known and worked with in the industry around a kind of shared thesis that a number of us were kind of coming to. And it sort of goes like this. On the one hand, I think I and my kind of collaborators in these discussions were all people who benefited enormously from the technology industry. And we're really believers in the power of ambitious technology companies to change the world for the good. We think that the biggest problems that society faces, whether that is climate change or the availability of high quality education or healthcare or you name the issue, innovation and the kind of innovation driven by technology and vicious technology companies will be essential to getting good outcomes for society. It's not the only thing, but it's a critical part of that. And so in that sense, we're great believers in the technology industry. It is indeed shaping the world that we live in. By the same token, I think we all looked at where we were at the beginning of 2020. And certainly, I think not much has changed for the better. And the trend of a technology industry that kind of moved fast and broke things as paraphrase was really quite troubling. It turns out we moved very fast and we broke some things that are very hard to fix. And when you take those two things, the power of innovation and the risks attended to that innovation and the unintended consequences produced by that, it really creates a situation that calls out for us as an industry, I think, to think very hard about. And so that's sort of what motivated in the first instance, the kind of motivating spirit behind us, a believer that we need more innovation, we need more good innovation, we need fewer unintended consequences of that innovation. And whether you think about technology from the perspective of economic growth, where it is the principal driver of growth in the economy, both in the US and in many other places around the world, or whether you think about it as this force shaping our lives, how we interact with others, the kinds of work that we do or don't do, and so on and so forth. It is essential that we get it right in really fundamental ways. And so for us, we'll talk more about this in the context of the discussion, but there's a way in which you can think about these problems in a very economic or almost technocratic way, that it's about getting a growth, it's about preserving shareholder values. A lot of ways that we get very kind of sort of bloodlessness in some ways about the way that we sometimes talk about this. But I think the thing that I kind of want to communicate and that motivates us is there's a real moral force to this work. There is a sense that who we are as a society and what our world will look like over time is going to be driven by this kind of work, right, getting technology that is responsible innovation that is in the interests of society. And so that's kind of where we're coming from in this. So that sort of lead us to, okay, well what's a great fine, we sort of share that point of view, but then what's a high leverage way to drive the kind of impact to sort of them the curve toward innovation that is more responsible over time. And our thesis kind of going in was, okay, well early stage technology companies are sort of where it's at, right, well it's if we can get to early stage companies and kind of help them in a variety of ways and what's talked about some of the ways that we might do that, that we would get better outcomes over time. And that proved to be true, but also challenging. And we've talked about some of those challenges as we, as we kind of get into this. Without going into tremendous detail, I think one of the things that became apparent to us was there are already forces pushing technology companies to be somewhat responsible, or at least let's say to appear somewhat responsible because there is sometimes both are true or one or the other is true. These are some of them I will kind of go through all, there's employee pressure which is probably for many, you know, US, West Coast, US based technology companies is maybe the most salient right, there's a lot of employee activism and pressure. But there are others, you know, people are familiar with the ESG movement and impact investing. And that's an increasingly important part of pushing not just technology companies, but really all corporate actors toward a more certainly in the public markets toward a more responsible path. But I think for all of these sources of pressure, because they're very ill suited to technology companies, they have not generally contemplated the issues associated with innovation driven businesses. And particularly for private technology companies because there is so little transparency, these sources of pressure don't ladder up to really sustained change and improvement over time. They tend to be one-off interactions between whether it's the investor or the employee group that sort of melts away and don't really amount to a time. So our view was given that there is that set of diffuse pressures, there was an opportunity to really drive toward more, you know, those things pulling in the same direction, so harness that diffuse energy and get it pulling in the same direction. And you know, as you said, when you were introducing, the first thing there in the core of what we're focused on is actionable tools, information, and frameworks that are operator oriented, it really distilled the very best of what is happening in the industry that take in voices from the right kind of stakeholders outside of industry, people who are knowledgeable about these domains. And begin to create things that companies can implement that help them be both more responsible and in many cases more efficient and more focused. So that's sort of our thing. One, eventually we hope to turn those into real standards and to get those standards implemented as part of the investment process for venture capital firms and other investors and the acquisition process for acquires. And through that to create transparency that can drive a path for kind of continuous improvement in standards. So we, we broadly talk about for pillars of our responsibility. I think this is, you know, this is one cut on a lot of different ways that you could talk or think about this. I won't go through all the text here just to say, you know, one is this sort of bucket of privacy, safety, and security. It's really this idea of respecting user autonomy and building companies that think about the user as an autonomous actor whose whose whose data and person and decisions have kind of independent value and dignity and building kind of government systems that are reflective of that. Right. So that's that's kind of one. The second is this idea of openness and diversity. And as we've gone through our discussions, I think one of the things that's become clear is this is in many ways the foundational thing and will will probably talk more about it in the course of the conversation. But who is at the table? Who who gets to make decisions? You know, at every level of an organization about what matters what problems have significance, what don't. Though all of that is essential. Not just to building a diverse organization, but to building an organization that thinks about the interests of society writ large. And so that's a that's an important topic of building an open and diverse company. And then economic opportunity inclusion is in many ways is sort of the the other side of the same coin. And it's really about the question of as we innovate as we build technology products. The impacts of those who is disrupted and who is not whose jobs are lost. And who's and who's our gain. How are what problems we choose to solve all of that is is really in this bucket of economic opportunity inclusion. How do we build an industry that pulls people up and along rather than one that leaves them behind and and pulls all the chips over to one side of the table. And the last is that you know is straight forward is environment sustainability the biggest crisis facing humanity. At the moment in many ways it remains a little kind of change and it's one that on the technology industry has a unique opportunity to contribute to solutions to and potentially also to further. So those are those are for us kind of the four pillars that we're quite focused on. Our process here and I'll sort of wrap up with this we you know we very much believe that it's not for us to come down from the mountain with the tablets and say this is what good looks like right this is this is what responsible is where smart folks trust us. We believe that it has to be grounded in practice. It has to be grounded in what people are really doing. But really finding the very best one of the things that always impressed me about Patrick call us and as a founder when I was it's right for many years was when we would have hard problems. Whether those were business challenges or or you know sort of some of the issues we're talking about for others. One of the things he would do is go and have discussions with the very best people he could find in the world and they might be people that we they might be other founders. They might be authors they might be academics they might be you know government leaders and sort of distill that kind of marinade in all of that wisdom distill it down and then say okay I think this is what we should do from that right I think this is this is this is reflective very best I can I can come up with plus how we think about it and then let's do that. We're trying to in some sense recreate that process the first product that we were focused on is what we call platform governance and will maybe explain a little bit more in the conversations to why we ended up landing on that product. It's really the set of of questions around under what circumstances can can users use a product when do you prevent them from using it how do you govern that set of interactions. And that obviously became enormously salient on January 6th it has been for certain kinds of companies for a very long time. Our process has been gathering facts from people having interviews with founders this 100 number is more broadly it's not only on platform governance that's a broad set of conversations we've had with founders on a lot of topics interviewing thought leaders and kind of doing literature reviews and kind of trying to distill all of that down. To the core of the framework that we can build and use it is a useful tool for companies that we can then pilot and gain feedback from companies on. So that's sort of this is the this is sort of the team right now we are we are growing up we also have a great big intern class this summer which was awesome so if any of you or your students of academics if you have folks are interested in internships on these topics we will we will continue to do that so that's also an opportunity that I felt like social. But that's very exciting and a very big project so to get us started talk a little bit about why responsible innovations was kind of why you joined this effort yourself yeah maybe there was something your personal professional experience you mentioned the stripe founder inspirations or something else I've motivated you to focus on on these very big important issues. Yeah, no it's a good question. So I think a few things a lot of these issues whether it's privacy issues D and I sets of issues platform governance issues were ones that I had spent a lot of time on in my career both at Microsoft and at stripe and so for that reason they were they were you know I think for all of them there was a set of they were away in which they were kind of the bird the bird in the saddle. You know you kind of you know you just need to keep working it it's just not quite there yet. So there's certainly some aspect of these feeling like unsolved problems that I had an interested seeing more work done and participating more in in the work. You're right though that the stripe experience was super informative for me in the sense that you know I'll kind of give this anecdote one of the things I always loved about working at stripe and I think one of the things that I said it apart and it's reflective of both its scale and sort of significance as a company. And you know in some ways it's kind of value and the maturity that's sort of reflective of that has been the founders you know John Patrick are really extraordinary founders in a lot of ways but but one of the ways is this sense that they were building from day one a long term sustainable business right this was not a business we were trying to just grow right it was a business that we expected to be working on certainly they expected to be working on for decades. And that kind of long term and sustainable mindset really informed everything we did. And one example of that that I you know I was for sort of responsible for driving was on the regulatory side right stripe is any heavily regulated business it moves massive amounts of other people's money around the world. It you know more or less the most heavily regulated business category that we have and even before we were regulated very early in the life of that business one of the things that I did we were a two year old company in the United States which was our principal market at the time we. You know new we would eventually need a certain kind of license what's called the money transmission license and so we went to regulators we should make up a conference the money transmission regulators association they have a conference every year and we went to their conference we booked a little hospitality sweep and we said we're from this little company stripe we invited them all to come in in in little box or from this company and here's what we do here's how we do it here's who we are. And as we grow you may hear more about us you know here's how to get not sure that's right and that that sense of engagement with and respect for regulators and their role which which which you know you'll remember sort of this is this is back in 2014 when the you know the biggest show in town was Uber which was a very different for you regular right it was sort of move fast established. Now we're going to ask established presence on the ground and their different businesses so I don't want to I don't want to overgrow the parallels but I think that kind of engaged and sustainable and long term model was one that we saw work well from a business perspective but also I think just fundamentally worked better from a kind of societal perspective we were able to do things that were reflective of the intention of regulators in ways that it would have been very hard if we had sort of we kind of hit and made them kind of run. So that that's that's sort of one example I'll give you one more in a little bit of a different being and then and then move on to your next if you do because others but you know when I was still a Microsoft well actually before I get a preference and say I think there's a way in which incentives and the creation of incentives you sort of takes on this moment. Right. Early in the life of a company. There's a lot of fluidity can change you know what what are the principal business drivers et cetera but those ossify over time you begin to build businesses around them makes our representations to your investors whether that's in the private or public markets and so those those incentives begin to drive the you know there's a period in which you're driving the incentives and then there's a time in which they drive you right and and one of the things I have often thought is that there were ways in which the companies that are very responsible for our present information ecosystem could have changed the outcome right there was a time very early in the life and I'll use Facebook but it's certainly not the only example when that company could have chosen not to kind of planted flag on the engagement driven social grass engage. And then I think that's the engagement driven business model and done something else but not in an example I'll give you here is I was at conference that the AP hosted the associated press hosted in 2008 or maybe it was early 2009 and it was around the question of algorithmic news and actually the APs focus if folks who were sort of you know in the industry or thinking about it back then would remember that it was Google news that was a big issue that really focused on Google news and it was really focused on Google news and it was really good. And one of the issues that was coming up at this conference was sort of what's the future of news and sort of these algorithmically generated news sites but one of the issues it was coming up from academics in particular was filter bubbles and the ways in which filter bubbles would create you know this sort of a cabling off of people into distinct information spheres and it was talked about from the past year and we were talking about the and it was talked about from people from Google and Facebook and others and the and the thinking of time was well maybe maybe it's an issue but people don't get most of their news from the internet and so they get it from other places they get it from the newspaper they get it from pb or or other places and so it's really not a thing it's really not a thing to worry about and I often thought you know back to your question of why why I'm doing this and why why focus on this particular effort I have often thought that there was a time that was a moment in which somebody could have stood up and said yeah we're aware that there's a possible downside there's a there's an externality that is real it's serious people are thinking about we don't agree we maybe don't agree that it's going to be that big or problem but let's do what we in Silicon Valley in the tech industry do really well put a metric on it let's measure it let's watch for it. And let's manage it right and and then you in my you know my counterfactual that may or may you know this is a person we'll never know maybe you end up in a world where the current fracturing of the internet information space would have been if not avoided at least much more aggressively manage much earlier I think to the manifest benefit of the world so I think that's a great thing. Anyway, that's my those are some some reasons and there's sort of lots of those are a couple of thoughts on that's great that's great I want to come back to the news and platforms and regulation a little bit later but if I make can I step back a little bit and let's talk about responsible innovation labs and how you build a nonprofit like that so we have Steve blank talking about customer discovery process and I want to see what I'm doing. I was wondering how you validate a need for this type of an organization and you mentioned a few interviews you did or many interviews in fact talk more about the process of building a non nonprofit like that how long does it take you know what kinds of stakeholders do you involve et cetera. Yeah, it's it's really it's an interesting question and for me very much you know it's my first time they'll be a nonprofit so I'm guessing there's probably other folks on this call who have lots of great experience that I could learn from but I'll tell you a little bit of what our journey has been. You know so so one of our key partners on this you may have seen this picture on the on the slides is to Montenegro who's managing director of general catalyst. Which have been very helpful they've been a great partner of ours because I think the partners they really care about this it's a big it's a big part of how they are working to build that firm and and you know even their their investment thesis but. One of the benefits of that of having them as partners they've been graded at putting us in touch with their portfolio companies and you know so so some of this I think if you were just starting. From from you know ground zero and kind of knocking on people's orders or sending cold emails that would have been a little tougher we because we had that connection. You know we we've been able to spend a lot of time with founders at a really high quality you know of of of of our companies at one of the highest quality VC firms you know around. That's been great for us because it's given us a lot of access and so what we've done is sit down with people explain a little bit of our thesis ask them questions around what matters to them how they make what are the issues that they're facing around. And it tends to be a little listen be a little bit guided discussions in the sense that you know there's some companies who are very I focus or some companies great healthcare focused and so on. You do find that there's a set commonalities across companies so diversity is an issue just about every company and it's often the very top of mind issue but. So we would have a series of discussions with companies to sort of discover where they where they had issues. You know where they saw opportunities for us if we had materials like this would that be helpful to you know it was a little bit of that. Kind of discussion and we did a lot of those with founders and those were I think in many ways the most informative. But with lots of other folks as well a lot with investors we've had some you know we can sort of tell you a little bit about some of the various wild hairs we chase down what if we did this you know what if we did we thought well for a while we could get the LP community that that would be the way you know we would sort of leverage the LPs to kind of you know lever the VCs of course have the VCs force that turned out for a variety of reasons not to be super fruitful but I we might have to say more about that if it's an interest but But but that but so that that that interview process mostly with founders of the core was that was the main driver a lot of what we did I think what we got out of that was a real clear sense that there was a need and I think we've come to talk about it a lot is like a last mile problem right there's a way in which you know you others people who work around this space know that there's a lot of really good thinking that's happening right in in NGOs and academia in various groups of the industry not that much is making it to the founders who are the people know what they're doing. So there's a lot of work to make in the decision a lot there's a lot of drop out there and so one of the things that we're we you know that would the became really clear to us is there's some stuff that we need to invent but a lot of this is just like finding the best stuff and getting it to people right getting into a people in a way that they can consume so that that that was kind of an interesting sort of validating thing. I mean broadly that's kind of been our discovery process we spend a lot of time talking to other NGOs in the space other other kind of nonprofits working around this I think through that became convinced that while there were people working on important contiguous aspects of the problem there was really nobody attacking it from this sort of operator oriented tools frameworks you know kind of practical utility. perspective or at least not in a way we we are thinking about it and so that also kind of gave us some sense that there's really a thing there there's a real space to fill. That's great and talk a little bit more about why you pivoted from these early you said earlier you focused on early stage companies but then later you realized maybe it's these later stage startups that are in most need of your or your tools. And programs talk talk a little bit about that change and pivot. Sure yeah no it's a good it's a good point and yeah so so what we started with was is he say it was sort of the sense that in the thesis being like okay it's early stage companies and I do believe you know I continue to believe that there is this real way in which the earlier you get to companies the more impactful you are likely to be able to to be I think that's broadly true. The problem that that frankly should have been people who worked in around startups for a long time should have been apparent but you know maybe optimism you know it was was was better than our kind of knowledge but. So what was the early stage companies you know as many of folks here will know are in a mode where almost everything is an existential issue right I'm like going to get customers like going to be able to grow the team I'm like going to be able to raise capital to do those other things. You know will I get product market fit and so on and every one of those is a sort of ticking clock with a kind of immediacy. That is salient right that wakes the founder up early you know very early in the morning to get out and go do those things and so you know I we had a number of founders express a thought in various ways but very similar sentiment which is. Look I care a lot about this you know one of the one of the things you will often have this founders who are multiple time founders they have a little bit of perspective on this they care a lot they care a lot about it they even have a little bit you know they're not. You know the company is it's their whole reputation is not on this company so they really care about it but what they will say some version of if it doesn't help me grow faster if it doesn't help me. I think I'm going to be moved more quickly I don't really have a lot of time for it like I will do it I'll do a little and like I'll do the things that are closest and so this is one of the reasons why diversity often ends up being. The issue that sort of you know it's sort of pops its head up as as one that early stage founders will engage on is because it's so salient for them and it is kind of critical path for growth the team they know they grow the company to off kilter and sort of in a non diverse way that it will hurt them in significant ways and so they do want to solve that problem but for many of the other kinds of problems whether it's thinking about ethical AI and how they're going to build systems that that protects. You know their users around that whether it's privacy or security or sustainability any of those things they're much more abstract and they they will get the marginal time that those companies have for those founders have and we're my you know is you know. For early stage companies it's very often the founder or one of a few co founders they're doing this work they're they're they're hiring their raising money they're selling and then the other hat is thinking you know about how to build an ethical company and that will often you know without any ill intent get sort of short shrift. You know and the reason that matters and sort of pivot to the larger companies question here is one of the things that you know folks will know if you thought much about startups certainly it was a for me a core learning from stripe is one of the most valuable things you can have as a startup company of any kind whether you're a gone profit or a for profit is users who will. You'll give you feedback will use your product and give you feedback on it right that's how you that's how you iterate quickly that's how you improve and ultimately how you serve a real need for a broad set of customers who find you know value and what you do and so for us finding a set of users who could be. Wouldn't just care in abstract way but actually had the time and resources to be able to engage with us was essential and what we found is that someone later stage companies anywhere from once a two to three years pre IPO through. We're really stage public companies were often the better partner for us for a couple of reasons they cleared a lot of those existential hurdles right almost by definition if you're starting to think about path of liquidity it's likely because you've cleared the product market fit you've got. You know the sort of the momentum of the company doesn't just depend on the founders and so you have a little bit of space to think about things that feel less totally critical path one. To you probably have along with that people who are responsible for those functions you have ahead of people you have a you have a general counsel you have you know other you know C suite folks who have as a part of their mandate thinking about aspects of this and so you start to have a partner that you're able to kind of work with there and sometimes people were or even more specialized on aspects of this like diversity achieved in privacy officer. So that's for us that's great because those people can really be engaged counterparts they bring some amount of subject matter knowledge and it's going to be a very kind of high bandwidth you know engagement. And the last is that they often you know because of trends in the public markets and and the expectations of investors and other things those companies that are looking to the public markets or and beyond. Kind of need to have an answer on many of these things not all of them and not not to the same degree on all of them but they they're going to have something they need to say to people about what what do we do about diversity well we need some story I don't know what is to be we're going to need we will not simply be able to just kind of you know you know I think I'm behind the shutter she look at have to talk to people about these things and so that combination of people you know space people and a kind of internally driven motivation this is the thing we know we needed to make some very customers for us. Our hope remains that we can use those folks as our kind of you know kind of in a ring to help us build these products but be able to kind of move the frameworks and tools sort of slide them down and ultimately potentially even slide them up a little bit as kind of in some ways all companies become kind of the innovation companies and aspects of this will apply to the largest companies but but for now that's sort of our that's where we're sort of starting and then hoping to kind of move around from there. Right so I want to shift gears a little bit and ask about your initial focus on platform governance so I want I was curious why you thought that platform governance is the right way to do it. This is the right place to start and I guess what is platform governance and why should we be worried about it. Yeah I mean it's it's a good question and I think it's you know it's sort of maybe reflective of the prior answer in at least in the first instance in the sense that it's kind of opportunistic right this for us was a place where we had a set of motivated users who really understood that they need help and I'll you know I'll say that someone who has been responsible for well actually well I'll answer your direct question which is what is platform governance or at least how do we conceive a platform governance. So platform governance is the set of decisions one makes around who can use a platform under what circumstances when will they be deprived of the ability to use it under what you know with what sort of process will they be deprived of the ability to use it and so on right. You can certainly cast it more broadly I think there are broader aspects of it there's questions or that touch on privacy and data usage and other things but the core of it for us has been this the closer to what you might call ethical use or acceptable use right it's who it's really this question of who can use a platform and under what circumstances and that came to you know that's been an issue obviously for a long time for the information platforms. For the social media companies but what would you know particularly over the last few years and especially after the January 6th Capitol call of the insurrection I don't know what we're calling it these days but anyway capital thing that happened is a bunch of companies that were well outside of the narrative on that question found themselves right in the middle of it right and so you have Amazon Webster as you know a web service as low level of an infrastructure provider as you are going to have right all the way pretty much to the bare metal of the internet except for you know the telecoats right who have a different kind of statutory framework that applies to them. Making decision to offboard another platform right parlor and a set of other users as well and effectively kick them off of the internet right you have you have obviously have Twitter deciding independently that the president of the United States can no longer speak on its platform and so and without making any judgments about whether any of those decisions are wrong decisions. What what happened was a bunch of companies realized they had really they had sort of accept acceptable use or similar kinds of policies which often amounted to a sentence or two in terms of service but those were effectively you know what we've lawyers will call holding statements right they were not they were not they were not awesome they're not very well thought out they will they were we will get back to this at some point in the future right and and what has happened after after you know the January is I think a wide swap of companies have realized we really need to think much harder about this and builds policies frameworks and internal processes that are much better calibrated to deal with this set of issues and so that's that's that's kind of why. We had a number of those folks reach out to us partly because this is an area that I spend a lot of time on in my career and one where I talk to a lot of my general counsel colleagues and about. When they understood kind of the mission that we were embarked on you know those guys want to go hey this would be a great place if you can help us this would be a great place to do it and so that's that's sort of so that's why I say it's a little opportunistic and I think I think if we had. In November of last year with not the area where we were going to start there was another areas that this one kind of rose rose to the floor and very topic also so as I think about this and how do you think about and how does responsible innovation labs think about regulation in this context so the two options we could go with government regulation or we would go we could go with self regulation by the companies themselves. To try to tackle you know platform governance issues power of digital platforms it all of these public concerns without platforms yeah what's your take on this. I mean my take and I you know I both mostly this is you're getting you're getting me John Zeger as opposed to a reflective of any particular of our you know users are or any way else but I'll kind of give you the sense both some of the sense of that I've got talking to others and my view on it look I think most companies would be very happy to have regulation in this space it's not true of every company. But I think most companies would be very happy to see clear and fairly prescriptive regulation that makes their judgment burden lighter because one of the things that you know the problems that we find right now is that the amount of judgment that is applied to these problems and the kind of unbounded state of the problem space right means that they're very risky they've a lot of brand risks that we can't do. You know you have a lot of employee risk they have a lot of risk for companies and all dimensions right you know you look at. You know any of the ones that the very public there's really it's a complete no-win situation right it's it's it's it's a lot to risk in both directions your balance on a knife as trying to make decisions in a principle way you know sort of dragons on all sides and you know the lack of constraint makes both enhances that risk results in a great deal of inefficiencies. So a lot of internal turn on these things and then maybe worst of all because it undermines confidence in the companies and creates a kind of cynicism from other actors is a sort of flip flopping where decisions you can go from a decision that is sort of this on on you know today and that tomorrow and very little change in the facts and you're sort of wonderful what you and so you know I think if companies could get regulation that was very clear prescriptive and and alleviated a lot of that judge I think they take. Many of them are taken not all there are there I don't want to you know paint with too broad of a brush but many of the companies you don't view information services in particular as core to their mission would absolutely just take it. The problem and you know depending on your perspective problem is it's very unlikely that's going to happen right what we're going to get if we get regulation is going to be some sort of broad you know requirement to do some kind of diligence that will create additional legal risk can lie ability to be. But it's very unlikely to alleviate the kind of judgment burden and the inefficiency group and so for those reasons I think the the core of this is going to have to come from industry and there's a role for regulation I think there will be I think over time there will be there will be some amount of regulation but I don't think that regulation is going to solve the problem that is most acute for these companies. Excellent we have only a few minutes left so I want to move us to the last segment which is sort of forward looking thinking about what success might look like you started a new organization. This is the first year so if we sort of step back and think about physically healthy 21st century technology ecosystem you know what's your vision what would success like look like there yeah really to come things I mean I think so one I guess I'll just say generally I think one of the important things to kind of think through here is that you know in many ways I say it's a politically healthy technology ecosystem looks like an ethic the healthy society right it looks like the innovation ecosystem addressing the biggest problems that society has. And being really thoughtful and now not exacerbating the ones that it has that it has helped to drive like in command quality and these kinds of things but with that as kind of a maybe to broad brush statement I think for us you know we will we will you know sort of evaluate ourselves based on the number of companies that are using our framework to make decisions. We want to see a lot of companies using our frameworks and I mean we're not proprietary about them if there are other great frameworks that's that's great to but we think our frameworks will ultimately be good and useful and reflective of a high standard of behavior and so that's one one is a lot of companies using them to and maybe more importantly we want to see capital allocators venture capital firms private equity others using our standards as criteria for investment. We think that at the end of the day the gasoline in the engine of America's innovation economy the world's innovation economy to a substantial degree is venture capital and so if we can get those firms to be thoughtful about as they are in many cases already right they're very thoughtful about the you know they have they have visions about what the technology state of the world you know whether it's been invested in alternative energies or AI or other they have a lot of energy. We need to have a view of what the technology state of the world they want to see you know they come into existence is going to be we need them to also have a view about what that responsibility state of the world is going to be and to use that as a gate for their investment decisions I think those are probably the things that are most important to us they're probably others as well but that that's how we evaluate our success. By the two audience questions the first one is we have a lot of students educators in the audience what can students specifically do as they are becoming tomorrow's innovators look I think is a couple of things that are important here what is. Students will be you know the kinds of students that are involved in a program like yours many of the other folks who are attending this are going to be some of the most sought after people by these technology companies right and they're going to have a seat at the table as they go into industry that will be influential and I do think there's a way in which we collectively need to. It's sort of a responsibility of all of us in the technology ecosystem to normalize asking questions about the ethics and responsibility of what it is we do. You know that's not going to be the same for everybody at every level but I do think there's a way in which it's critical that you so we kind of normalize those questions right and that we are not merely kind of the platonic rational economic actor like we're we're we're we're we're actors in society. And and so that's kind of the thing I would I would say is sort of first at foremost I think for students and for researchers students who are in their education career researchers who are doing this over the longer term there remain I think a whole enormous set of questions that are unanswered around the intersection between practice and outcomes so we'll give you an example that we've been thinking a bunch about in the context of diversity I think that. Performance evaluation systems right which are enormous are are the driver of how income and wealth to a substantial degree are allocated a technology company is very very important. Our our our driver of how people progress in those companies who has power in those companies are I think an area that has been a kind of comparative backwater and where there is enormous opportunity when we talk about diversity and inclusion we sell them in my experience talk really hard about those systems right I think there's a ton of opportunity to really figure out what works. What makes people feel valued included how do we eliminate bias in those things is a lot of superficial stuff is very little that I think is is is very real and there's very little that's measuring the outcome so it's an example but it's one I think it's one of it's one of many. There's a ton of opportunity to research how practice and outcomes relate to one another on these responsibility issues.
