 Who you are defines how you build. This is Thought Leaders Revisited, a special summer 2020 edition of our OddPrioral Thought Leaders series. During this summer of uncertainty, we're inviting some of the most influential past ETL speakers to join us for a series of new conversations about innovation, leadership, and especially finding opportunities in the midst of a crisis. On this episode, we're joined by Joseph D. Simone, Joe co-founded Carbon in 2013. Carbon is doing groundbreaking work on 3D printing for a wide range of applications, including urgent needs during the COVID crisis. We're welcoming back, Jeff, who was here up just almost four years ago in 2016. He co-founded Carbon three years before that. Previously, he was a professor at the University of North Carolina. But while you were there, you were also doing these scientific breakthroughs, like I mentioned, co-founding several companies all before launching Carbon. So, can you share a little bit more about that path and how you balance those two? Well, sure. It's great to connect with Aduki here as a tar hill, but in fact, my first PhD student, Valerie Ashbees, now Dean of Trinity College, at Duke University. So, I'm much more tolerant of my Duke colleagues there. But, yeah, Carolina hired me when I was 25 to help start a polymer program. And I brought a utilitarian-like perspective from Virginia Tech, and a liberal arts education from our scientists college, and tried to meld all that together, and launched my program. It was a center-based research. I had great students. We really focused on fundamentals that would have an impact in the real world, I call it translational research. But I taught entrepreneurship. We had an entrepreneurship minor in a college of arts and sciences at Carolina. But, and I started several companies, but I was never on the field with any of the companies. And, and as you know, you learn so much more by doing. And when Jim Gatz and the team at Sequoia asked me to, I had already hired a CEO for Carbon. If they asked me to lead it, you know, I thought, boy, now that would be a real opportunity to learn from the inside and be on the field. And it's been an incredible run. Six years of CEO. That's a 24-7 job. And for six years, it's very intense. But, you know, there's nothing like that in academia. You know, when I walk in the parking lot at the company, you know, all I see are car payments and mortgage payments and people that left great companies to come work for our company. And there's an immense amount of responsibility that you have as a founder, CEO that is, you know, there's really nothing quite equivalent to that in the academy. Yeah. Well, car has been quite a ride. So let's, let's talk a little bit about what's going on from since four years ago. Let's do it in this context. And this has been our format this summer. As you heard about, and we're going to keep riding, rolling this, take some of the clips from that period and then fast forward to now and talk about what's happened. And then prepare, well, make sure for sure, talk about the future. So let's set this first one. And it has to do with the model that we, well, frankly, it's one of the mainstays of entrepreneurship education that's cross in the chasm. So let's play clip number one that you showed back four years ago. And a chasm is in this technology adoption curve where in the beginning of all new technology introductions, the techies drive adoption. Techies love products, in fact, ladle of products that are not complete. They like to cobble together a partial solution. And that's part of what they love to do. But to really get to the early majority or the large volume of revenue, unit and economically viable solution. People don't care about technology on the other side of the chasm. They want a solution that's economically viable. You look exactly the same as you look four years ago. I'm glad I didn't wear that. I took that sport coat off. But but all right. So this is a very important concept as I mentioned in entrepreneurship education. So where is 3D now? Yeah. The adoption curve. So, you know, up to this point, I'm commenting on it. Yeah. So up to the point when carbon launched, 3D printing has been mostly a prototyping industry, right? And that includes hardware, software, materials, even the parts. And that's about an $8 billion marketplace. I also had some dental in there. Dental has been part of this sector. And so that's probably the more most commercial of the traditional 3D printing. You know, when we figured out how to take 3D printing and go faster and make real parts, that was the beginning to go into the $300 billion manufacturing world of injection molding. And so I think, you know, what's crossing, crossing a chasm for us is what are the use cases? What are the killer apps, if you will, that drove high volume manufacturing? And, you know, a data, I don't know if I mentioned a data spec then, but you know, data is our is our partner. And, you know, that's it. And we always saw a boy, if we could scale up a consumer running shoe, you know, the world would be our oyster because we would have figured out a lot of stuff, you know, advanced materials, global scale manufacturing. And we figured that out. And now you go at the.ditas.com and buy the, you know, the alpha edges and the 4D and lots of great running shoes and over a million pair already with that. We also have liners for red Dell, football helmets, personalized helmets, over a thousand NFL D1 athletes and many other sports coming along. And so those high volume consumer, including, you know, specialized bike seats, they all happened. We've crossed the chasm. And now it's scaling to replace foam more broadly. We also have the very first parts on production vehicles that are Detroit. New cars, Ford Mustang, F-150 trucks, the very first parts on 3D printed polymeric parts on those cars and trucks. And so that sets the stage. It took us two years to get through the quality, for quality standards to make that happen. But now that opens up many billions of opportunity in electrical connectors and other sort of applications in the automotive space. And then, you know, in the healthcare space for us, you know, not only dental and dental models, but you know, we have now the first FDA approved 3D printed dentures. And you know, you could argue that we should do nothing else but dentures right now. It's a $14 billion marketplace. We have over 5,000 people now wearing the first 3D printed dentures. And so there are great examples of crossing the chasm. But they are the killer apps. And we need thousands of those. We're expecting to do thousands of those applications because that's what manufacturing is all about. And that's what we're focused on. So, we choose the lead, Jeff Moore, who developed that model. As you know, he talked about Bowling Ali, where you're not over the first pin. And it... Yeah. So, what was the first pin? Was it the shoe? It's the shoes. And the Bowling Ali, for us, there are several Bowling Ali's. We try to be disciplined, but foam replacement. Using a last-term or lattices to replace foam from adidas running shoes, specialized bike seats, redelfollow helmets, all those kinds of advanced applications. Another Bowling Ali, for us, would have been industrials. Yeah. Electrical connectors, Vitamix, Lamborghini parts, NASA parts. We have parts on the circulating space station on the first autonomous untethered vehicles circulating the space station, Becken Dickinson. So, they're Bowling Ali's. But for us, it's really a platform to make parts. Resins are the enabler of the TAM. Right? Every resin opens up new TAM, new capabilities, new properties. And that's how we think about it. My niece went berserk when she heard I was talking to you. She's a teenager back in Minnesota and a big adidas fan. So, that's all it took. Well, you know, I used to, it's neat to be a chemistry professor and have be the cool kid on the block with sneakers. So, it's unusual for me. All right. Well, also back then, you talked about four years ago, talked about future proofing, which I really loved that term. I not heard that before. And future proofing your customers through an innovative business model, which I heard those about that. In other words, innovate not only in technology, which clearly was a no brainer for you, but also the great companies also innovate in business models. So, let's play that clip number two, future proofing customers. And again, as I mentioned to you, that we're coming out with this printer as a subscription model. Right. It's a rental. What this really does is it aligns us with our customers printing. Right. This is not a transactional sale. It's a partnership. And most importantly, this future proofs are customers. Right. I know the product roadmap. I know when this product is going to be obsolete. Our customers don't have to worry about that. Right. They're not locked in. They're future proofs. And especially for a company like us, it's just coming out with a brand new technology. You know, I don't have the heart to have people buy stuff that I know is going to be obsolete. And so the subscription model for lots of reasons becomes an important way to move a new product into the marketplace. So how's this business model working? It's been the key to the whole business. In fact, I looked at the slide and I forgot to appreciate. So that was our first printer, the M1. And we only built about 100 of those. Now the commercial product at that scale is called the M2. And just as a great example, it's got twice the build area. And so it went up two X and the price went up 25% to $50,000 a year instead of 40. And so that's an example of, you know, people, you got twice the build area, you can have twice the throughput and you didn't have to be, you know, throw away the other printer, right? People can upgrade and we actually have a customer that that took back all the 100s and are using them in other markets or they're continuing to be used beyond their three years. And so that's a great example. But the key is, it's 100% smart hardware that takes over the air software upgrades. And the process is intrinsically digital. We think of as a software control chemical reaction to grow parts. And so the what's key is, we've been able to do software upgrades every six to eight weeks. And the process is getting better and better. So in many ways, it's like a network effect, right? The more people use it, the better the product's getting. And the ability of rolling out new resins. And so now in sort of hindsight, I don't know how you introduce a new physical product without doing a subscription model with it, which intrinsically future-proofed customers. And it gives us really close relationships with our customers. So they're partnerships. And we get to know who we're doing business with. And 35% of our sales are so goes to existing customers. And so it's really a land and expand marketplace. And it's an install base that's growing and growing. And the subscription model really helps us with that. Well, that is that. Well, again, another big important takeaway that we stress in all our entrepreneurship courses is, and it's, you know, especially for our STEM students, is in the lightens in that innovation is not just you know, relegated to being a technology breakthrough. It can also be a business model breakthrough. Totally right, Tom. I think the board, the company, everybody believes that the breakthrough in the business model is as significant as the technology. And it's built relationships. It's kind of what Alan Malali did when he was at Boeing and had power by the hour for the GE jet engines. And so it's really been a key part of who we are. All right. I want to talk to you about COVID because I realize you're over at the school medicine here at Stanford right now. I am not on campus. I think you might be one of the very few people on campus, but I want to talk about COVID and what's you've been doing in that. But before we do that, let's talk about sustainability. I know that's been a core value for the companies since the get go. So how do you how do you emphasize that in both the technology and the business model? Yeah, I they're actually have to be done hand in hand. You know, we now believe we know the 3D printing is going to be big. And you know, so many businesses don't think ahead about the implications of their technology. You know, when you look about, you know, think about Uber and it was going to be a company that was going to eliminate congestion in cities and now it's causing a lot of congestion or, you know, Joule was going to help people stop smoking and it started vaping and you know, encryption was going to protect our privacy and it's now the domain of criminals. I mean, just you have to think at the broad implications that for carbon, 3D printing is going to be big. We have to think ahead of schedule ahead of time about environmental stewardship. Right. So we've been able to now take that as an initiative out of the gates and think about our largest volume resins, the latest running shoes, dental models. And what can we do to make those recyclable? You know, you think about invisalign like products, right? We make a model of teeth and your thermoformer sheet of plastic on it to make an aligner. And the 3D printed model is a single use plastic. It's used for 30 minutes and it's going to be landfill for hundreds of years. Because it's a thermoset, our technical team is designed a resin that can turn that back to liquid, a reversible thermoset. And we think we can do that for, you know, a last-term relaticist too. And so if you can do that, and you have a business model that collects those and doesn't rely on the municipal waste stream, right? But you have a business model that you bring those models back, you chemically digest the turn-effect liquid and reuse it. So that's where we're going. That's a higher calling. And when every part has got a barcode on there, you can actually quantify maybe for the first time somebody's environmental footprint or recycling data driven. But you also get into lightweight parts, bio-based feed stocks, local for local production, and ultimately avoiding inventory. You know, inventory ties up a lot of capital. A lot of parts are sitting in air-conditioned buildings just waiting to be used. So you think about on-demand inventory, and there's a lot of things on the environmental side that are really enabled by having a digital transfer, a digital manufacturing platform. Well, a lot of impact there. It, well, it, it sounds like science fiction, but it's not. It's, you know, I still get goosebumps. So, you know, as a polymer person, I remember in grad school, you know, just making a, make a test specimen that looked like a dog bone was hard. And now we just print, you know, thousands of them. It's, the team's been amazing. It's really been pretty remarkable. Well, sustainability and climate is, is, is a big deal. And it's, it's a big issue for the planet. It was in 2016. It is in 2020. And we've been faced with some other big deals that have come along this year. So let's talk about COVID. The reason you're on campus this afternoon, I'm assuming is from, from what you said this morning, when you're, you're meeting with the, the dean of our school of medicine and the CEO of Stanford Hospital. So a few weeks ago, and as back in May, we had Andy Carzner of X as an ETL speaker and he about, you know, for everybody's watching, if you go back to the ETL in May with Andy Carzner, it's a fantastic ETL about speaking of climate and sustainability. That's his expertise. But about 20 minutes in, around the 20 minute mark, he goes off on you in a big way. And he's, and he's talking about this COVID thing that you did. So can you, before we play the clip, can you tell us a little bit what's going on? Well, you know, I mean, the context, you know, I was moving into my governance role at the company, Ellen and I just traded places and, and, and, and, and COVID hit. And all of a sudden, we're getting in and dated with knowledge about supply chain disruption. And we've been talking about from the very beginning, what digital manufacturing can do. And we are mostly thinking about earthquakes and storms, things that could disrupt the supply chain. Then you get this pandemic. And all of a sudden, very simple things like face shields are in massive short supply. And the hospitals, you know, they only stack a couple weeks of supplies on these things. And now all of a sudden, they're just inundated. And then, and then COVID testing swabs. You know, the biggest factory for making these testing swabs is in, was in Lombardi, Italy. And they got hammered with the coronavirus. And so here is the disruption that is actually the irony. It's disrupting the things that allow us to test for the disruption. And, and so there was this massive shortage of air force fluid in the last million swabs. And everybody was panicked. And, and I didn't know what a nasa pharyngeal swab was when I started. And, and, but we looked into it and, and we could walk you through. Yeah, let's, let's play the clip and talk some more about it. At Carbon, our purpose is to improve lives with science, technology, and creativity. When COVID-19 hit, and we saw a world confronted by medical supply shortages, we knew we needed to do something. We brought together our employees, partners, and customers to address two needs. First, protect healthcare workers. Second, increase testing capacity for COVID-19. Digital Light Synthesis, our 3D printing technology, is enabling the protection of those on the front lines by making up to 50,000 face shields a week. And more accessible testing, thanks to resolution medical lattice swabs, crafted with carbon technology. Together, we're making what the world needs now. So, I just want to solve a tick of minute here, or a second, and just recall the compressed time. Yeah, we're talking about. So, we're in June. We're still in the pandemic, but this was about four months ago. You're having an incredible run with what? Huge deals with the DEDAs and the other major companies you talked about. You could have just sat back and, you know, rode that momentum. But then you got inspired. So, how about this? What were some of the, you know, tell us a story about some of the, I hate to put in the negative, but what were some of the roadblocks you went through to make it happen in such a, you know, fast time? Well, as you know, everything was happening so fast. And then, you know, the other thing to realize is that a good chunk of carbon's business is in dental. And dental was shutting down. Right? So, there's this capacity sitting there. And a lot of our partners are sitting there. So, we had, you know, Ellen Coleman called a town hall meeting and Philip and I, my son, we hosted over 300 of our partners and team members. And we said, look, we have a lot of resin. And we have a tool that doesn't need molds to make things, right? It's using light. And remember how people make things physically, typically, by injection molding, is you have to invest a lot of time and energy to have a mold. And then you, he'd have plastic up, you fill the molds with a part, let it cool down, open up the mold and take the part out. We do things without molds. It's moldless. We use light to craft things. And so, what we did is we pivoted our capability, our machines, our team. And we said, look, we'll push face shield designs and we'll design two different ones to meet the properties of two different high volume resins that were sitting there available, our dental model resin and our data's running shoe resin. And so, working with the data's and working with all our dental customers, we pushed designs out into the field and right, we're approaching a thousand printers globally and we're at 17 different countries and we gave people that had capacity and interest, the capability of keeping, not only keeping their employees going and keeping their businesses going, but to help out in their local communities. Right? So I think we did over 350,000 face shields, 50,000 shields a week and still counting. And people are renewing and now they're going into grocery stores and dentist offices and all sorts of things. So that's pretty cool. The testing swab, we literally learned about what the conventional swab looked like and we printed new varieties the next day. One day. You're good. No, it was amazing. Hardic and our team and Marie and Steve Pollock, we figured out some early designs, went through a couple of dozen different designs and then we worked with a medical device partner resolution medical who is an FDA registered medical company because we're not and stood up a supply chain that leveraged the dental labs. Remember, there's there's 7,000 dental labs that support over 100,000 dentists and those labs are our customers that have our printers. They're the ones that make the physical things that dentists use and we pivoted one of our dental resins that was used for making night guards. It was already FDA approved for night guards, it's approved from eucosal contact, it's a soft plastic and we created a very soft lattice structure and we brought a medical device to life and resolution medical launched a device in 20 days, a Class 1 exempt device and then 50 days later, and that's why I'm over here at Stanford, 50 days later we completed over a 400 patient clinical evaluation of two different lattice designs and compared them to a standard swab for performance. Performance on comfort, collection efficiency, the PCR compatibility, it was a non-afferiority trial, it's more than equivalent, and there actually is a hint that we have a lower false negative rate for low viral loads and so we need to go study and quantify that but it's pretty remarkable that in 20 days you can bring a medical device product to life and complete a 400 patient trial 50 days later. Well, you are helping the heroes and you're helping us, just humans that as well, I think you're up the supply chain of heroes as well, you and your company and I hats off to you. I want to talk more about that but maybe we'll do that during Q&A, I just don't want to miss this opportunity to play a couple more clips having you do with another phrase that I remember well from four years ago, the drivers of innovation. And you're talking about this notion of convergence, so can we play a couple of clips, first clip is about connecting with the humanities which is another big theme of ours nowadays at Stanford and the entrepreneurship center. So let's play clip number four. You know, historically the word convergence and its meaning has often implied the convergence of the physical sciences engineering and medicine. In fact, that's the way MIT has classically referred to convergence. But I think what it really means is bringing together disciplines in maybe not so obvious ways and thinking about what emerges from that. But I think more broadly and what Apple has done is I think you have to think about extending this to the social sciences, the humanities and perhaps even the performing arts. And thinking about tech and the humanities and the liberal arts is an important aspect. And as part of that, I think a lot of people believe that convergence itself is actually a blueprint for innovation. If one can get convergence right, I can be real driver for new ideas. Can you give us some interesting examples of convergence? Well, you know, I think in the beginning, especially back then, I was building upon what we were talking about with hardware, software and chemistry all coming together. You know, those are disciplines that are spread out and there's a lot of good stuff in between those disciplines. So there's that level that is very tangible and I think it's easy for people to understand. Software control, chemical reaction to grow parts. You know, that is very tangible and that's a foundation. But then you think about that in context of a business approach. The idea of rolling in a subscription model, which has never been done in a physical world. Certainly, this is the very first piece of manufacturing hardware ever to go out with a subscription model. Right. And then 100% hardware and what that means from a context of inventory replacement and the like. And so, you know, now you roll it up and you think about, again, back to the liberal arts, you think about everything in context, right. You think about what it takes to make an impact. What are the economics? What are the history of all that? And, you know, understanding all the business aspects and supply chain dynamics. And to me, it's all the convergence coming together that enable you have to think about the business model, societal implications, helping our customers where to make impact to think about recycling now as opposed to waiting after the fact. And realize you've caused a problem like I alluded to with with Joule and other companies and, you know, and it's really the contextualization of what it is you're doing that really brings all that together. And, you know, we're now working on, you know, meeting folks here in pediatrics. We're working with folks, neonatal babies that have cleft pallets and they can't, they're too young to have surgery and working with amazing doctors here to seal the pallet and maybe work with pallet expanders as the babies grow. And, you know, it's having, you know, the wherewithal, the understanding of context and impact and being open. It's a big part of it. Well, I was interested in yesterday. I had the opportunity to attend an urgent or important academic council meeting, you know, in other words, it's gathering all the the number of professors at Stanford and it was a mix of humanities professors and engineering and physical sciences professors. And I was, it was just there was an issue on the table. That's not so as important as it was, I heard over and over how the engineering professors loved being part of a liberal arts university. And I know that that's the way professors feel it for at UNC and Duke. That's why it's very comfortable for me to be a visitor because that's the, especially since I'm an entrepreneurship professor, my counterparts at UNC and Duke feel the same way that it engineers are learned about the humanities and of course humanities majors are learned, you know, enough to about technology to be renaissance people. Everybody can learn to be a renaissance person. It doesn't have to, it's not something you necessarily born with. I just play another clip that, because this is also, you know, a very, very important topic this year and this is the advantage of diversity. It's play clip number five. You know, you know, recognizing early on that we learn the most from those that we have the least in common with. Right? And you think about that. If you're part, if you're getting part of a design team and you're fortunate to be part of a design team, you recognize that these different experiences drive the innovation process. I can tell you more times than not at different design teams I've been associated with, what's, if somebody grew up with not much money, they think about problem solving fundamentally different than somebody that grew up with a lot of money. Not that one is better than the other. They're just different. And if your goal was to broaden the perspectives around the table, then you have to think about this diversity, this element of diversity to drive innovation. That was four years ago. Yeah. How about four weeks ago? So how do you think about diversity now and what's going on in America in particular? And what does that have to do with carbon? You know, it's not a lot's changed, frankly. And when you look back, in the late 1990s, my group, a very diverse group of Carolina, I graduated over 80 PhD students and half were women and others underrepresented in sciences. And I had a very large number of African Americans in my group. And I was given a talk in South Carolina in 1990s and the NAACP had a boycott on the state of South Carolina because of the Confederate flag. And I was a keynote lecturer and we decided we weren't going to go as a group. And what happened was they ended up moving the meeting to another state. And now we hear about NASCAR finally addressing the Confederate flag. I mean, it's just, a lot has happened, but a lot hasn't changed. And you know, our faculties don't represent the diversity of our student population. And there's so many things that we need to keep working on. And again, back to the importance of this, this is where the richness of innovation is, right? The diversity of perspectives, the thinking and cultural values, all that comes together. If we don't get this right, we're holding back innovation. And it takes a relentless, unfortunately, it takes relentless leadership to keep making this front and center because I'll tell you, I see it so many times that if you don't keep it front and center, it's easy not to do. And it's got to be relentless. And people fall back to not thinking about it. And and you know, it's uncomfortable being with people that are different than you. And that comfort has got to be harnessed, right? That's where all the richness is, right? It's and early in my academic career, I'd invited to an innovation group. And not only was it all white guys around the table, but they all graduated from the same research group. And they all knew the same stuff. And they were at a structural disadvantage for driving innovation, right? Your community is, you've got to think about your community, your groups at the onset, or you're not going to be as innovative as you possibly could be. And that's something you've got to be relentless. It's great Ellen Colman. This has been a big passion of hers too. And one of the great reasons why she's part of the team at Carbon. And she's been a strong advocate. And it's a really important thing for us. Well, take a moment to talk a little bit about Ellen. Please, I wanted to do that earlier as well. I think this is important because she has a great reputation in terms of the DEI. Yeah, no, Ellen is amazing. You know, so we got Ellen Malale on our board at Carbon. You know, he was the iconic CEO Ford Motor Company. And we needed chemical acumen on our board. And I asked if anybody knew Ellen, she just stepped down a CEO at DuPont. And I didn't think I could get to her, but Ellen could get to her and maybe invited her to play golf somewhere or something. But she came and she checked us out. And I knew their technical team at DuPont. They knew me. I think she did a little due diligence there. And she joined our board about four years ago. And brought a lot of perspective. And she's been my partner in crime as I've been leading the company as CEO for four years. She then became our lead director. And, you know, lo and behold, she is, you know, she's having a great life. I thought being a board member. She's a board of Goldman Sachs and M. Jen, United Technologies, Dell and Carbon. And she's fairly young and wanted to get back at it and to be CEO somewhere. And I had been CEO for six years. And, you know, my heart and soul is in academia and doing after 24 seven. And we ended up switching roles. And so she's she's CEO. She switched in November. Her timing is not great right before COVID. And, you know, when she joined DuPont, it's right before the financial crisis. So other than that, it's been really great. And what great leadership as we scale our business, you know, she really understands global dynamics and how to build businesses and scale them overseas. And, you know, we're in 17 countries now. And she just brings, you know, that kind of scalability, the processes. And it's carbon continues its trajectory. Having that kind of leadership has been awesome. Thanks, Joe, for that whirlwind. We can come back to some of the important topics that we were covering just in DEI, for example, and some of the future proofing convergence in anything's game. But I want to give our students and others a chance to to participate. Now, I see a question here. It's a little bit long, but let me just let me do the punchline and backup. How does carbon select its clients? And does the company take into account long term impacts of the client's company? This has to do with, you know, itself may allow waste reduction and capital optimization for its clients, clients activities may still be significantly contributing to climate change. And speedy 3D printing may just accelerate their activities. So how do you balance that sort of competing values, I guess? Well, you know, a subscription model is a partnership and it allows you to assess your customers and also allows you to understand your values and your value align. We, with a subscription model, because we technically own the hardware, we have terms and conditions for its use. So along those lines, we actually say not for weapons, right? Because we have advanced materials and we don't want to usher in a new era of security issues. And so we get to say those things. And that allows us to work with the kinds of customers we want. And this is the environmental stewardship opportunities allow us to hear the feedback from customers and understand the technological challenges to enable their aspirations, right? So designing new resins and new business models help drive their aspirations. So that's how we think about that. All right, here's another one related to somebody building on that. When would you suggest a subscription model? Many people complained about software subscription models because costs add up. Well, you know, I think the compelling reason for us is this future proofing. I actually think that subscription model is more compelling in the physical world than it is in the saw into its, how else could I say, the more it's as compelling as you can get? Because the last C U 1 is to have legacy hardware. And a transactional sale where your provider is not aligned with your business goals. You know, we get to limitry for the printers. You know, they have 80% use time. Many are working over 100 hours per week. You know, we could watch a dip on the coronavirus. We watch to come back. All those things allow us to work closely with our customers. And I think if you've got a hardware business, you've got to think about this. Unless it's a hardware business that's one and done. When you launch a platform and we're staring at 30 years of innovation, I cannot imagine a more compelling reason to not have a subscription model. It's really enables one to work closely with your customers and really drive innovation. Imagine if you were inhibited to innovate because customers would get mad at you because they just bought your hardware. Right? This now, like gets rid of that hesitation and you're just driving innovation the whole time. We've got another question here and I'm really glad to see this one because I wanted to come back to this topic and this is around DTI. It says, how do you track and measure your efforts on diversity and inclusion? How do you make this a relentless pursuit? Where are the pitfalls? How do you go beyond just the optics? This is something that's going on in the leadership of pretty much every enterprise you can think of whether it's a startup, whether it's a rocket shift like yours, whether it's an established company. Yeah, no, that's a great question. Something that I think I learned early on is that you've got to be clear about your values. Early in my academic career, as Boycott is one example, if you're clear about your values on your website and your promotional materials, what happens is you become a destination for excellence wherever it's at. People want to align themselves with who you are because their purpose driven many times. If you're also clear about your values, it's almost self-fulfilling because there are some people that realize maybe they shouldn't be part of your organization. It can be really self-fulfilling about that. Being clear about what's important to you becoming a destination for excellence is a key part of that. And then it's actually measuring and quantifying that. You look at carbon as we get ready for the next phase of carbon. We've been very intentional about our hiring and our General Council Meg Dibi, our CFO, Alisa Day Martell, our CHRO, Barb Cardigan, our CMO, Dara Tracita, now our CEO. This is a manufacturing company that's led mostly by women and a great team. But it's not at a board level. We've got two women on our board. I really like the new laws in California about the number of women on board because it allows us to go back to the investors and say, look guys, I meant guys. It wasn't the Philadelphia guys. It was the literal guys. It's like, look, we need to be compliant. There's too many people occupying precious seats. The investors who are often not very diverse have got to give us latitude and companies to be able to allow our company's boards to be reflective of our values. It takes the leadership of the investors to realize that we've got to create seats. Even if those regulations help drive it, I'm really grateful for that because it gives us a strong argument to have the boards reflective of our companies' values. There's a question here about the COVID work. I'd like to share that with you. After COVID is waned and we don't know when that will be, could be this year, could be next year, could be a while, could be a while. Yeah, I think so. Do you see carbon continuing to make medical devices? That's a great potential market already, but is this going to, is this a big bollion alley for you? Yeah, I think it's TBD. There's over 100, the nasa fair and geol swab was invented in like 1922 right after the Spanish flu. And there's over 100 different swabs out there. It's going to be performance driven. There's a mid-terbanist swab for the naries and an oral swab. We were just on a great call with the Jan Zuckerberg Center here with Steve Quake and his team. There's a need to integrate designs for high-throughput analysis instead of humans breaking off the current stem of the swab. To me, I think there's actually going to be multiple products in this space that are going to be new products that no one's ever redesigned a swab in 100 years. And so there was no reason to. And so now, the Sun you realize that there's capabilities to improve performance, improve function, improve comfort, opening up new high-throughput opportunities for sequencing and or testing. So I think it's here to stay. And what's going to be interesting too, there's some really important dialogues out there now about supply chain disruption for our nation. And I think I would rank order things like pharmaceuticals and biologics and making sure that we're able to have these available in the country. You see a lot of work on integrated circuits and chips on ensuring of that capability. And then physical goods, what we do in the ejection molded world and having reshoring manufacturing and having the flexibility of pushing files in different directions in different locations in order to have agility in the supply chain. Those things are here to stay. And the COVID was our moment to shine of what digital transformation, digital manufacturing enables. Joe, we've got more questions here, but I'm watching the time and I'm realizing that this is a special moment. And you're a special person. I mean, just what you've accomplished in your contributions to the planet and it's well-being so far in your life. But put yourself back in being an undergrad. And that's our sweet spot with this speaker series. It was in 2016. It was 10 years before that and it still is. This is an amazing time to be a college student. If you think, you know, stop for a month, you know, and think about all the same goes with me. So, what do you say to this current generation of college students and how they might be feeling this summer with all these things firing at one time? Yeah, that's a great question. But, you know, these are going to be badges of honor this time, right? I mean, it was in 9-11, you know, it was in the financial crisis, you know, this is going to be a time that it's going to be remembered. The stories are going to be told. And what I think really magical about this time, and you know, that's the word I'm going to use magical, is there's so many things happening now, right? It's not just the coronavirus. It's the economic impact from the coronavirus. And it's the racial disparities all coming together. And this apparent chaos is going to give, you know, this is the moment to fix a lot of stuff that needs fixing that has been taking too long. In my lifetime, it's taken too long on a lot of racial diversity, inclusive issues. And all of a sudden, now it's time. And you could do it through the cover of chaos. I heard someone explain it the other way the other day that way. And it may have been a coach K leadership thing that I was on. I hate to hate to admit that, but it may have been on that. But nonetheless, this is the moment. And I think everyone is going to be able to reflect back on this moment what they did to help make a difference because this is a tipping point on so many really important things. And to me, this is an inspirational time, especially we make at this moment, the fixed stuff that taking decades and hasn't been fixed. And that's they're going to be able to tell these stories. This is going to be their badge of honor. This is going to be their moment. And when they deal with other issues in the future, they're going to be, we're going to be okay because we lived through this time and we came out better for it. And that's that's what I would tell the undergrad. The entrepreneurial thought leader series is a Stanford E Corner original production.
