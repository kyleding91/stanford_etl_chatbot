 Hello ETL fans and happy new year! I'm Ravi Balani, a lecturer at Stanford University and managing director of Alchemist Accelerator, and I'm here for our final special ETL episode to offer my take on Entrepreneurial Lessons from 2020. Last year, defied all our expectations and disrupted our personal and professional lives. From the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic to the economic whiplash many have experienced, it was difficult to find focus during this incredibly challenging year. But the Entrepreneurs and innovators who visited ETL this year brought us weekly lessons in how to find agency in times of crisis and uncertainty. If Entrepreneurs take away one lesson from this year, it's to start with just one thing. Most companies start with good ideas. Your company won't fail because the idea itself is bad. Your company will fail because you will hit the end of your runway without having taken off. The end of that runway is running out of energy as founders or cash from customers or investors. And you will not have taken off because your attention was spread across too many things. When overwhelmed by forces that disrupt and distract when starting or running a venture, take steps one at a time and execute each one with extreme focus. When creating products, block out the extraneous pressures and start with the problem you want to solve for customers. Let that be your North Star. During our fall quarter, Play vs. founder and CEO Delane Parnell put this insight front and center. So did Zoom founder and CEO Eric Yuan. Let's start with Delane. Here he is at ETL in October 2020, talking about his first year building Play vs. into an esports phenomenon that since raised more than $100 million in venture capital. I don't think I've ever been more focused than that first year. Truthfully, I moved to LA basically knowing not many people. All I did was go to work and go home. And even when I went home, I had a mattress and then my entire living room was a replica of what my office looked like at the science building. So desk, chair, same desk, same chair, same monitor, whiteboard. And it was basically all work, no play for me. So I was extremely focused on learning the industry, developing a product, talking to players, talking to educators, talking to publishers, talking to state associations, talking to people who would become future employees. Just trying to figure out how we could fit into the space and build a business. And during that time, by the way, at first year, I guess the first eight or nine months, I never talked to investors. Most people sort of come up with an idea. They do some initial work and then they immediately try to start talking to investors to quote unquote build relationships for a potential future race. I spent zero time thinking about raising capital or talking to investors. I was super focused on putting the core of the business together and building from the near, not raising the around. Delain brings up a great point. While an early VC race can supercharge a business, pursuing that funding also requires a lot of time and energy. If entrepreneurs can afford to bootstrap for a period of time and focus on nailing product market fit, they can go to investors with compelling evidence of a scalable success. With play versus, Delain built a new solution in a new market. CEO Eric Guan on the other hand launched a new product into an already crowded video conferencing market. How did he succeed against established and better funded corporate competitors? Like Delain, he too emphasizes the power of focus. Here's Eric. When Google and the started already have a job, I think you started from listening to the user plus, I think sometimes in terms of opportunity, when you start, you do not know how big it is. However, in the future might be bigger and bigger. I think as long as you can have a solution and plus you have a vision, you can build something better that others can essentially deliver a unique value for some of the users. I think it's the why. Don't always think about, hey, I have to enter into a market. It's a huge market. It's not like that. I have for every business, I think. Don't look at the score, you know, focus on the game. So don't look at the big, position market. Think about how you can survive, keep serving your customers. A long way, you might have an other opportunity to start with, always start from very, very small. When you send your news, I always talk about you, I'm talking about how we can survive as a company, how we can survive. We never say anything about it, the bigger things. Delane and Eric found focus in their own ways by starting with just one thing. For Delane, it was nailing the right partnerships with schools and game developers, which were essential to the play versus business plan. Eric began Zoom with a vision for delivering better value to his end users and stuck to his conviction that as long as Zoom could survive, it would eventually thrive. To learn more about these two extraordinary entrepreneurs, I recommend listening to their full talks. We will include those links in the show notes on E-Corner. This episode wraps up our series of 2020 takeaways. Check out the amazing speakers we hosted in 2020 on eCorner.stanford.edu or wherever you get your podcasts. And join us this winter for a brand new season of the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series. We'll kick off with HipCamp co-founder and CEO, Alyssa Ravazio, on January 27th. The Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders is a Stanford E-Corner original series, produced by the Stanford Technology Ventures program in Stanford's Department of Management Science and Engineering.
