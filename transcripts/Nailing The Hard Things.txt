 You were listening to the DFJ entrepreneurial thought leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Oh my goodness, Ben Horowitz. Have you ever heard of this guy? Have you read something by him? Is he funny or what? So if you haven't, then go up on the web. You don't mind if they surf a little bit, whatever. I mean, you work at Netscape. You started this with the first browser. Get on your browsers and devices and go up and read something by him. Either during this or even later and it will be hard to put down because as I was prepping for this, my goodness, you just ruined my Sunday. I got word. I had this opportunity to interview you and I said, well, I've been reading this stuff and I've been assigned this stuff for a long time in my courses. But I never really met you before. Or if it's so, it's been a passing. So wow, I'm going to really take a look at it. And it is super informative and super interesting but also funny. So how did this happen? Where did this all come from? Let's start with college. College. College. Where did you go up, Ben? Well, I grew up in the People's Republic of Berkeley. I had a question right there. Beach never. You're Berkeley. Oh, no. I ain't. Oh. Oh. I did Berkeley. That really about sports anyway. It's more about communism and weed. So what peace call me communism and weed? But now, how else did Berkeley influence your entrepreneurial bent, do you think? Well, you know, Berkeley, when you're a teenager, you tend to be rebellious and not want to do kind of what your parents do or what the establishment does. And if establishment in Berkeley was hippies. So that kind of caused me to want to be the opposite of a hippie. And so I joined the football team and I was kind of just oriented around like what was going on in the world and wanting to be part of the society that I was definitely counseled to stay away from. So it was kind of good in that way. Although I have a great feeling for Berkeley now that I'm no longer rebelling against it. I see more value in some of the hippie culture and all these kinds of things. But you know, the rebelling has kind of drove me from being a communist to being a venture capitalist. Well, let's take the journey on that, that transformation. You went to college at Columbia and UCLA. Would you study in what you're going to read to that? Yeah, well, I studied computer science. And in those days, well, when I got to Columbia, computer science was a little bit of a kind of frowned upon major, if you can believe it, you know, given what's going on today, in that there was a big debate in academia at that time that computer science wasn't really science. That electrical engineering, that was like real. And that computer software was just like the tools you used to program the computer. Like it wasn't like there was nothing to it. It was kind of a thin layer and it didn't warrant its own major. Like it may be a class, but not a major. And so, you know, everybody in the major was like, what are these guys idiots? You know, they ought to actually try and understand like how a compiler works and so forth and then make that claim, but that was kind of the beginning for me. Is a funny sort of question perhaps, but what do you wish you had learned? Or spent more time in? I've just been thinking about that myself. I went to Berkeley and first time I've ever admitted it here. But three times. But I was an undergraduate engineer and I avoided sociology and psychology classes. Of course, now being an entrepreneurship professor over 20 years, that's exactly the roots of entrepreneurship. So what do you, what are your grats if any about what you study? Well, it's funny because when I was in college, the thing that I thought I was doing that was a huge waste of time was I was completely obsessed with rap music. And, you know, I would listen to it constantly. And to the point where in those days there was actually no, there were no rap radio stations and there was no and UMTV rap set and come out yet or any of that stuff. And so there were only two rap shows and they were only on one day a week on Saturday night. So I would never go out on Saturday night. I would sit at home because I had to record them. And then in those days, it wasn't like these fancy like record to disc. You had a like tape. You would press record. And then when it got to the end of the tape, you had to be there to flip it around and do it. And then if you were smart, you would be there to pause on all the commercials so that you could get more life out of your tape. So I missed like all that college life and I was like, wow, I probably wasted a lot of time. But now like my whole career is kind of based on my affiliation with rap music. So that's what I'm best known best for. So that turned out to be good. You know, I kind of wish I had studied more biology. I was very interested in it and I did not realize at the time that kind of information science and biology would connect when they did or in the way they did. I studied a little neurology in graduate school as part of AI, which was also seemed like a complete waste of time because AI didn't work for like 25 years. But now it's working. So you never know. I guess I would say, you know, anything that you learn is a good, you see your time probably. What skills can these students learn? You think while in college, in addition to perhaps a technical, we're in the engineering school. So let's assume they're getting a great, great dive into technical matters and science. But what about the rest of the skills that will serve them well, no matter what they do? Yeah. So, you know, in the world of entrepreneurship, the big skills are kind of programming skills and people skills like those are the big two. And I think people skills tend to be highly underestimated in terms of kind of just ability to run a company and so forth. And what I mean by people skills is the ability to understand other people's motivation and other people's motivation so you're talking to and then who you're also not talking to and how they're going to think about something and where they're coming from and relate to that in a way that gets you to the right conclusion about how you build an organization or build a company or make a deal or any of these kinds of things is incredibly valuable. And that's what I would say most of the kind of good entrepreneurs end up lacking more than the technical skills that we've seen now like being like a boss level engineer like that's extremely valuable. I'm not discounting that but that's really the other big, big skill that you can learn. And in school. And we've seen that in engineering education and curriculum it's added a great deal of those kinds of skills and behaviors and techniques since we were in school. The other thing I want to talk to you about when I think back is you came out of school and then the internet came upon us as an opportunity and it's defined your professional career. I was a little ahead of you in a lot of years before that was software. It was software on a personal computer and I got so lucky that we, you know, the being software you always thought in my early days you thought you had to go work at a mini computer or a mainframe company which was really boring. So package software was just this big change I fell into with a lot of luck at Symantec and so on. So for you, how did you, were you brilliant to see that opportunity or was it just so obvious that it just drew you in and it's been your life? Well, yes. So in the beginning, because I ran into the internet long before I kind of moved my career that way. But in the early days, so when I kind of first interacted with the internet it was, you know, it was slightly after DNS was invented. For those of you guys, I don't even know like it may be too low level plumbing. But DNS is a system where you map the name of the computer to the IP address and like how that gets licked up, you know, get host by address, get address by host whenever. But, you know, but DHCP which is basically the protocol that gets you your IP address. So like when you connect into whatever your Wi-Fi hotspot and so forth, then you like get the address like that had not been invented yet. So the way you got on the internet, when I got started as you'd like call a guy and you would say, can I have an IP address? You remember. And you'd be like, okay, like here's a four octet number and you'd go in, you'd edit your file, it's a host and you'd put in your four octet number and there was depending on your version of Unix or be some other file you had to edit. And so like and that was and then it was all text-based and you know there was, we had email on it at that point. And like it was obvious that like the plumbing was going to get standardized because there were these other kinds of you know rival plumbing systems like, you know, NET BIOS or NET Buie or Landman or SNA that were just like they were vendor specific. So it was like yeah, there's going to be one network. But the internet like the way we think of the internet today was not at all obvious at that point. But then when actually my partner Mark built Mosaic and I saw that for the first time and there wasn't that much on it. You know, there's like a guy who was monitoring his coffee maker to know when it ran out so he could go get coffee and then there was some guy in the and London put his restaurant menu and he had an Indian restaurant, they put that on the internet and those were like the things that were up there. And it was like, oh wow, like this is going to be everything because I had enough of a basis and understanding to go, you know, and I called my wife who's sitting here for leisure. I was like get the kids, we're moving to Netscape, that's it. You know, this is definitely a future no question. But I had a big like if I had just seen Mosaic, it might not have been so obvious but I kind of had seen all the other stuff and I hadn't quite gotten there yet. And you were working for a big company initially out of school. So I was kind of graphic. So I wanted to talk, can we talk a little bit about that because I was talking to my undergraduate class this morning and a number of them are seniors and they're thinking about life after Stanford and it made me, in getting ready to chat with you, I thought about what's happened in this room the last month. Many of these folks were there. Matt Rogers from Nets went to Apple right out of, I think CMU, I think I'm going to get that right. Louis Cerney came out of Dartmouth and went right to Apple as well. And you did Silicon Valley or Afics, but those are, you know, is that just old school? I mean, is that just old bad pun? But is that just last decade or decade before or is there value now to work for an established company out of school? You know, there's definitely value. It's kind of the same value that there was when I did it. So when you come out of school, you know some things and there's a whole lot that you don't know and there's kind of advantage and disadvantage in building a company at that point in your life. But the big disadvantages in the things that you get from a big company are one. You really have no idea how to run a company or manage a company and going to a big company, that's where I learned how to manage and it wasn't so much that there were like great managers who managed me or something like that. But the way you learn how to run a big organization is to work in a big organization because it's the frustrations you have trying to get something done that basically become the basis for the design of the organization when you're on the other side because you're like, okay, if I was an engineer and it was taking me, you know, an hour to like check something into the source coach and then like 12 hours to build it, like that would be a nightmare. So now I'm back, you know, running the company, I know that that's going to be an issue or if like it took me a week to get a decision made like how frustrated would I be, whereas like you talked to a CEO right out of Stanford who's never been through that and they've got guys sitting there like not being able to get a decision made and they're like, what's the problem? That's like a lot like that's why you've got like all the attrition nobody wants to work for you but it's harder to figure out like if you've never worked in a company like why that would be such a big problem to like not be able to work for a week on anything because you're waiting for somebody to make a decision who does some think it's important enough to give it the time of day. And so these are the kinds of things that you learn and there's like a million details around that which you just can't learn like you just, it is not intuitive. I guarantee you nobody figures out how to do that on their own. So and that is the best way to learn it. So that's the first thing and then the second thing is you have, you meet people who like people at Apple, like Facebook, Google, like smart people and you kind of build a reputation so that if you go to build a company like those are people who's skills and who you can draw upon and who you can hire and work with and build something really excellent. And then the third thing is you kind of learn about the world and the basis of a good company is to basically figure out something about the world that nobody else knows and then that secret becomes the company. And if you've not been in the world like then your basis for the secret is you just have a more limited scope of what you might have learned. Now there are people who learn stuff in school that is a big enough secret like you know Mark Zuckerberg figured out Facebook while he was at Harvard like absolutely. If you have an idea that big then by all means go for it but like if you don't and you try and go build a company with zero management skill and no network that's hard bro. That's going to be hard. And you have to think like who would want to work for you? It's like, unless it's like well everybody smart will want to work for me because I've got the breakthrough idea of all times and it's running away like a freight train and it's growing like nothing else ever then yeah definitely start a company but if you don't have that and you try and do it and you're competing with like Tony Fidel who like invented the iPod and is also starting a company for engineers like where would you work? Would you work for you? Would you work for Tony and that's the kind of thing you have to figure out. I've got so many questions asking different directions that we can go in. How many of you have heard about his book? Yeah I mean it's so it's there's been a few really cool books come out this year Peter Teals book came out Waldor Eises and has done a really cool book about history of Silicon Valley and so on and it's look at the hard thing about hard things which is just the where that title come from? Yeah. Because that's just a it's just a way cool title. The hard thing about hard things. Well actually wrote that title myself which I understand is like actually pretty rare in the book business that they let you keep your own title. But where it came from was you know when I was a CEO it was easy time I slept like a baby. Woke up every two hours and cried. And you're trying to roll it. And you know when I would be up and this is not a joke it's actually true you can ask my wife I'd be up at three o'clock in the morning just sitting there going why are none of the management books that I'm reading helping me like they're they are no help at all and I read literally every management book and you know I realized that you know management books are generally written for like how here's how you to not screw up your company. But if you start a company that lasts like a week and then you've screwed it up and then like where's the book for that you know and that's what was missing. So I would think about it I'd be like okay so like all the VCs and everybody tells me you know bending you know what the key to a great company is you know hire eight players. And I'd be sitting there like oh great because I was going to hire a bunch of fucking idiots and now you've unlocked the secret for me thank you but you know like that wasn't like that way and I was like that what the hard thing is not to like hire the best people right like the hard thing is when your company is going like this and the great best people don't want to work for you and then like who do you hire and like how does that work and like you know do you hire the person who's like okay across the board or do you hire the person that's got something like horribly wrong with them but like super great about them and like how do you think about that and like what do you do with that horribly wrong stuff once you get them you know that's a hard thing and then there's like in a day where this Jim Collins books which I hate but some of you like them I know it doesn't mean you're not smart if you like them because a lot of people smart people like them but the thing that he does is he makes you feel good about yourself like but then when you get into it you realize cause and effect is all like swung around and all these things but he's like big what great companies have is a big heriodacious goal and I like that's great but that's not hard like it's pretty easy to write a big heriodacious like we're going to go to the moon you know we're going to build the biggest company in the world we're going to have software on every desktop it's all going to be ours like that's our goal okay so now you've missed your goal and like Natalie did you miss your goal but you build up your whole company to achieve your goal and you have a cost structure that's designed to hit your goal and you missed your goal and you're running out of cash and the company's burning to the ground and all of the company everybody works for you thinks you're a moron because you missed your goal okay that's hard like that's a hard thing like what do you do there well that's not in Jim's book like you need to talk about that it's like nobody ever misses their goal who's a great company so like why would you miss your goal like you must that be great it's like okay okay so anyway that's that's for the hard thing about that thanks this some of you are already entrepreneurs I can tell I just want you to translate the F word for a friend's from your wife yeah sorry does that translate yeah I'm going to CEO Tourette syndrome oh my goodness what that was a bit of a wartime CEO rant just then talk about this piece time versus wartime CEO in the context I mean since we're on the book and and it is a lot from your you opened up and talked about what it was like to run the company let's let's talk about that difference yeah so and it really is a difference in wartime and peacetime it's really a difference in the decision making process and the reason that I kind of wrote that that piece wartime CEO peacetime CEO is that if you read the in the management literature it's almost entirely written for peacetime CEOs so like everything you learn about decision making you know in in delegation and don't micromanage and all these things are very peacetime oriented in the sense that in peacetime you're much more focused on the development of the people and the development of the organization over the long term and the ability for the organization outside of yourself to make higher quality decisions and and then also kind of be creative outside of the mission and that's kind of all affordable if like you've got say you know like you've got Google search and you're just like running steamrolling through the industry then you can do a lot more kind of peacetime sort of things on the other hand right if you're running out of cash or if you're like Apple when Steve Jobs first took over and they had three weeks of cash left and so forth like you can't actually like that's not affordable in the decision making process you've got to get to the very accurate decision extremely quickly and that's when you kind of have like a that's when the wartime techniques come into play and you know sometimes in wartime you end up doing things that actually do undermine the development of the organization because there's more burden on the CEO to make a much larger number of decisions because accuracy is so important and that's CEO by virtue of her position has got more knowledge to make those decisions and and more authority too to make them definitive and fast and high quality so that is a lot about what that was about and I thought you know a lot of it came from Andy Grove has a great book called Only the Paranoid Survive which a lot of you probably have read here but there's a part of it where he talks about when he turned Intel from the memory business into the CPU business which is like a real wartime story like it's like okay like I walked into the room and I was like okay what would we do if we were if I was fired tomorrow and then like somebody came in to replace me and then all my whole staff was fired and replaced all of them what would they do with the business and then like I walked out to the car like I had a cigarette I looked out into the distance that was like all right we got to lay off 80% of the people and you know those kinds of things are they're just not things that you kind of normally encounter in the business education but in the real business world that's like most of it most of it ends up being wartime particularly in startup world like a huge amount of it ends up being wartime so that's that's kind of the basic on a related post and I don't want to miss this opportunity especially for the students in the room and thinking in particular the undergrads to hear it directly from you these leadership and entrepreneurial traits that we talk about in terms of starting a company you were here a couple weeks ago with Sam's course talking about you know how to starting a startup or something like something is the name of the course so there's a lot of emphasis on starting the company but the real hard stuff comes after some success and so the skills and the behaviors it takes to start a company is is that the same as it takes the scale it and grow it or which ones are similar well so like startups get really hard when the product gets into market and those those if you have done it know this right like when you're building the product it's all good you know how is you start it's doing fantastic you know we're building the product it's going to be great it's so genius like everybody tell about it kisses me on the lips and says wonderful but then you get in market and nobody wants it like then it gets real hard real fast so that's like kind of the first psychological trauma but the the the initial skill is can you build a great product can you build a product that you know a lot of people really want for whatever reason and that is different then kind of building a great company and but if you can't build a great product that matter if you can build a great company because you don't belong in a startup because if you can't build a great product and they were get to the great company and that was actually a big error in the 90s and a lot of the lean startup methodology and so forth came out of the mistakes that were made in the 90s where they'd bring in a professional CEO really early on who didn't know how to build a great product and would you know build a company to a giant size and burn up all the cash but the skills are different but you know like management skill as management is a learned skill it's not like nobody was born a great manager and I think that's one of the things people run into is you feel like oh well you know like that person over there just seems like such a natural manager but like it's not nobody's really that natural at it it's an unnatural what you know now oh yeah it's a very unnatural job like you know like so I'm having this conversation with you and if I you know like if I stopped you and it's like time you know like the way you ask me that question like it was okay but like you didn't really have any the right emphasis at the end and go back and practice and come back tomorrow and do it again like if I said that to you you would be like that guy's an asshole and so like anthropologically like you don't want to do that because if everybody doesn't like you then they're going to feed you to the lion or whatever so like it's not natural but like as as CEO as a manager that's what you have to do you have to evaluate people's performance you have to correct them you have to make sure they're on task and those kinds of motions or you have to learn how to do them and you have to learn how to do them in a way that you know everybody doesn't hate you all the time you know they're going to hate you some of the time you just screw up my night because now I'm going to go home and my perfectionist it's going to take over and I'm going to say I really didn't ask that question so I'm a lay I'm a lay awake at night oh can we talk about a 16z first of all where who came up with that for the first time I mean in the and recent where it was so was it you and recent horror it's our a 16z yeah I didn't which one oh a 16z so I came up with a 16z that was mine that's me baby and then so let's back up why did you and Mark start a firm and what now 2009 for five years ago why did you start a DC firm so it's really a simple idea which that you know kind of started on a thing that that he got like really fired up about which is he's like Ben you know it's so crazy that when we look at the companies that you and I really like you look at like Amazon Hula Packard Microsoft Oracle you know any kind of great technology company Google and so they're either like run by their founders or their founders are like right at the top of the company like the founder is like essential to every long lasting tech company IBM but the Silicon Valley way the way of venture capital is to replace it the technical founder with a professional CEO so like are we just like focused on building like mediocre companies here like why is that and so you know I was like you know that's that's that's kind of right having been like technical founder CEO like that was like the very first meeting with my venture capital firm was like when are you going to get a real CEO and so we thought there ought to be a firm that is designed for the technical founder to to enable the technical founder to run basically her own company and with the basic idea of being it's we came to the conclusion that it's easier to teach the innovator how to be a CEO than to teach a CEO how to be an innovator particularly in a domain that you've transplanted them into where they you know it wasn't their invention it was somebody else's that you're kind of trying to advance and that was kind of that that was basically the idea for the firm and we thought that was you know like I was you know startup type stuff you thought it was a good idea so you go ahead and try it and you know it did turn out you know we refine the idea a lot we said okay well what do you need to be a CEO if you're just like an inventor and it's like well first you know it'd be great to have somebody on your board who's actually like started a company in Bones CEO and so our first thing was like our motto with some experience required you know to go on your board which is very unusual like if you most venture capitalists have not like run companies or and certainly not founded and run companies and then the next part was you know we felt like the network like that was the really thing that like made the VCs eyes pop out of their head it's like oh that guy's network he knows all these customers he knows all these executives he can build the team like really fast and it's going to be awesome and so we thought well like what if the firm like was that network like what if we just built the firm into a giant network where we knew like every important customer and every great executive and every great engineer what would that look like and that's why we have 100 people at Andreessen Horowitz you know and eight investing partners and like most other firms are kind of the opposite kinds of ratio and much fewer people because we wanted to build the professional CEO network for the inventor CEO. Yeah it's fascinating I went on the web and I you know look at your site and and I'd suggest you do that as well look at a 16z site and look under the people or the about the team or what have you and you'll see these 100 employees in different categories some in marketing some in business development some in well board members I forget the other categories finance technical talent yeah across the board and then look at the sites of the other firms it's it's quite remarkable so in the fight let's just also since we're a bit on metrics of the firm and then let's talk philosophy the first fund was how much 300 million 300 million so you raise it from other folks and then you go out to invest it and that was five years ago now how how much total capital are you managing 4.7 billion wait a minute that's a lot of squilla I got excited but was that in your mind when you started five years ago or that happened organically or I mean it was it I wouldn't say accidentally but did you imagine you'd be managing almost five billion so like one of the things we knew from being entrepreneurs and this is this is a very very key point in entrepreneurship is that it is just as much work and just a traumatic to build a company that's trivial and nobody cares about then it is to build like a really significant important thing like it's the same amount of work so you might as well try to do something important and so that was our always our thought with the firm we were like we are going to like our goal is to be the most important venture capital firm in the world you know like it's a completely megalomaniacal and arrogant and idiotic but that's like if you don't have that attitude as an entrepreneur like you should not be an entrepreneur so yeah we were always going to be the biggest we were always going to be the best and that that was the goal and there was no reason to exist if we weren't going to do that now did we expect to get there that fast now of course that that that would be ridiculous we thought it was going to take much much longer but we always thought like if we can get there like a big thing in venture capital is size because you know one for an entrepreneur to know that you've got a firm who's not just going to give you you know five hundred thousand dollar for your seed round but then when you need the next round it's still got money like that so that's actually a big deal but then in our model the other thing that was important is in order to build the network we needed to be like one of the bigger more important funds because building the network costs money and the bigger the fund the more fees you have the the more money you have and so we could direct direct those fees right we didn't pay the general partners much money but we pay the everybody else in the firm and so that was all part of the theory of that well I'm trying to think of some questions that might not be asked you know too often of you the six I mean that just the success that in terms of headcount and fund size is remarkable what about the conventional VC firms that you admire there must have been a set you say you know they're really good for that you kept you know in other words the core principles that you brought for because the brand you've built in five years is just in you know it's it's over the top in terms of impact and but what have and you've been very disruptive but what was the conventional pieces that you kept yes so we actually a lot we spent a lot of time with Andy Racklef who was on my board and actually teaches here at Stanford often and he had a bunch of philosophies that were that we adopted and you know we we still he was a benchmark in yeah he's a benchmark and you know one of them was just like 90 I've you know he had done various studies but somewhere between like 90 and kind of 97% of the returns for like any given year of all the companies that get venture funded is concentrated into like 15 of them and you know Peter Tiel talks about that a lot in his book and so forth but that's a that's a really I would say counterintuitive principle and very important a lot of the design of the firm is around this that like if you can get into make investments in some significant percentage of those top 15 and you're going to be a good fund and if not you're going to basically lose all your investors money that's the easy principle which is kind of why the all the returns go to like five firms every year like the if you study venture capital there's when we started there were I think 800 venture capital firms is a lot less now but all the returns went to not only like five firms every year but the same five firms for like 30 years and the reason is or the reason was that the best entrepreneurs would only take money from the best venture capital firms and the best venture capital firms up until kind of you know I would say like up until really yes we're mainly determined by their results like so you know what companies had you funded in the past so it was an awesome business model because of self perpetuating like as long as you're at the top you are very likely to stay at the top we were able to kind of crack that open by doing something that was really unconventional at the time which is not unconventional at all anymore which was marketing so we were sort of the first venture capital firm to super aggressively market itself and we had so we had a unique position in a very aggressive marketing idea and that sort of opened it up to say well like they may have a much longer track record than us but we will tell you exactly exactly how we think about building a company like everything from like how you hire how you conduct a layoff like how you think about capital raising like everything we were going to lay it all out in great detail and up to that point the industry was just super opaque like you didn't know it was all like the man behind the curtain which was actually a very good strategy for the people who were winning it was just a bad strategy for new firms but new firms tended to just adopt what the old firms were doing so that was the big breakthrough you know it's not a breakthrough and you couldn't break through that way now because everybody markets their venture capital firm but we got through in time so yeah I'm going to open it up here in a couple of minutes for questions from the audience but oh I can't help it what are some companies that excite you now you know we know the big winners have been best in but it's always fun to think about the potential game changers at least in your view yeah well everything's exciting we love them all the same we love all of our children so well one company that's really exciting is a company called Databricks which is a guy's out of Berkeley and they invented this technology called Spark and so those of us who kind of like are in the industry there's been this thing called MapReduce and Hadoop which some of you are probably familiar with and the thing about and Hadoop has got like crazy momentum in the world in the market and so forth but anybody who's kind of gone in and tried to program MapReduce or dealt with it knows like technology's a little left up and in multiple ways why it's just like hard to deal with it's hard to program it's hard to use but it's also has technological assumptions that are already starting to get out of date for example like you know the big one big assumption in MapReduce is like things are on disks and network speeds are slow so that you've got to farm out the work to a lot of nodes have it computed and then like sent back up but you don't want to be doing computations across the network because that's going to kill you so that is kind of fading and these guys have come up with basically a much better programming model and a much faster kind of solution than MapReduce and it's got great momentum in their geniuses and I think it's going to kind of take over big data so I'm like really fired up about that one another company so here there's this a funny story of kind of how adventure capital works so there's a company that we invested in called T-spring and inside the company so T-spring on the surface basically makes T-shirts it's much more than that but like it's you know this is the thing about venture capital like we invest in things that look like bad ideas but are really good ideas and this one really did look like a bad idea when we first thought it's like T-shirts like like how big could that be but what it really is is a platform for converting your social capital into actual money and it works like unbelievably and in the conversation about whether we should invest or not like most people were saying like we cannot invest in this it's T-shirts like you're out of your mind like what are you doing and it wasn't even me who was the one who was out of his mind it was somebody else another partner and then one of our partners said well this is one that doesn't work in theory it only works in practice and it has continued to work in practice amazingly well so those are both. Thanks for sharing that so let's open it up to questions we've got a few minutes here how about right here on the aisle. Hi thanks for being here Ben I wanted to ask you you mentioned wishing that you would take in more courses in biology and the intersection between biology and information science and I'm wondering I mean specifically related to job-own how would you see that space converging and what do you think job-own needs to do to really differentiate themselves from their competitors in that industry? Yeah so and job-owns actually a whole another dimension on it too so job-own makes devices that monitor your health from you know slate to steps to heart rate and so forth and a lot of it is you know they you know so part of it is how do you collect the data in a way that's not like obnoxious you know we're at like look school and like it's you know it's fun to wear and those kinds of things but then the other thing is what kind of insights do you get from it and and I think they're doing actually quite a good job of building a data platform for not only a data platform but a team of people who are really deriving insights from across the population like what's the normal amount of sleep that people get and I think they've already conducted like the largest sleep study of all times and things like that but these kinds of things if you know okay people like you know and then you start to segment that like okay people my age you know from with my genetics what kind of sleep do they get and then my blower under on that so I think you got to the next thing is to get like the 23 and me data into the job-own platform and you start to you know put that together and you really start to understand where you are in terms of your actual health against where it should be with people who are kind of like you and what you should be eating and all that kind of thing let me check in the back of the room oh bow let me see I'm looking for some uh wait wait in the back next to the camera let's say that you are the technical founder and your simultaneously trying to juggle between that uh building being a product meet and also being the chief evangelist is that guy as the company grows obviously all free back to those vectors you've had pulling which of those would you say is first to be delegated away and how would you think about that decision can you repeat the question just in case yeah so it's okay what if you're the technical founder you're like the head engineer the chief evangelist the the number one designer um and like you can't do them all indefinitely so which one do you delegate first uh so I don't actually think that's probably you know it's probably less of a functional question and more of uh like when do you find somebody that you trust that can replace you and those things because um you only get leverage and this is something that is really tricky for founding CEOs to get to but you only get leverage um if the person that you hire uh can do it better than you can um because as long as you feel like you're better than the then there's not you're just going to keep second guessing them and and you're not going to get any leverage and a lot of times like I'll be talking to CEOs and they'll have an executive and they'll be like no this person's like really good and they're working really hard and I'm like well but like you're always like frustrated about like you know you always feel like you have to do that yourself and it's like yeah because they don't understand how to do this and that and I'm like well then like they're not an executive um because the whole point of an executive is to get you leverage uh and so on a question like that it's like okay where can you find the right person and make the hire to get you leverage and wherever that is that's what you should give up first um and you want leverage in all spots because as CEO you can be um the keeper of the vision the quality control over the top you can but you can't be the lead engineer forever like that there is no like and it doesn't matter how good an engineer like Larry Page is great an engineer as he was is not an engineer at Google he just isn't um and he cannot work on production products it's a full time job even for like somebody who can do as many things as Larry it's he cannot do that and nobody can't like if Larry can't do it you can't do it either I guarantee you um and so you're gonna have to give him all up uh and so it's just a matter of like where do you get the leverage thanks how about right here so if you you mentioned that you were um interested bitcoin and you guys are investing coinbase for for um the asset or money that has fluctuated so cracy value of the last couple of years yeah um what what really makes you so enthusiastic about cryptocurrency in general yes that's great question so the the question is so like your investors in bitcoin your investors in coinbase um like but it's gone up and it's gone down and then it's gone way up and way down and like in panic and mount oxy didn't say all that but uh you know that's kind of in the book why do you have any confidence in like cryptocurrency why is it going to be a thing it's fake money like you're an idiot um he didn't say he wasn't meeting that he was actually prompting me to say something good about bitcoin to shut all you naysayers up uh so the thing about bitcoin um so let me kind of break down what cryptocurrency is and why it's important the the first thing to understand is it's a legit computer science breakthrough so it solves a problem that was first specified i think in 1983 called the Byzantine generals problem uh and without going into the exact Byzantine generals problem which is um interesting and complicated think of it like kind of like the dining philosophers problem for those of you who take computer science uh but the big thing that it solved was like the ability to transfer a piece transfer not copy a piece of digital property from one person to another or one machine to another so um and in order to do that you have to uh basically solve the double spending problem so nnaiv version of a of a kind of uh electronic money would be you just make up a big set of serial numbers and then you give them out and so then i give uh you a dollar um but the problem with that is you don't know that i didn't give that exact same dollar with that exact same serial number um at the same time deflation like you have no idea that i didn't do that and that's a hard problem to solve the double spending problem so bitcoin uh you know the the original bitcoin paper and the blockchain um kind of uh technology solves the double spending problem and lets you transfer a piece of digital property from one person to another so what does this mean it means that kind of for the first time and then the way that's been solved through history like is like with visa or something right where they run a ledger that keeps track of all the money that is kind of transferred from one person to another but the problem with visa is several fold one is that um it's a proprietary system and then they uh you know it's a reversible system so there's a large fee associated with it um with bitcoin that solved there is no person in the middle so it's the first time that there's a ledger um that everybody can use that nobody owns and the reason that that's important is if you think about what was really powerful in my youth about the internet was it was a network that everybody could use but nobody owned and what that ends up meaning or what it ended up meaning on the internet and why everybody the reason that everybody underestimated the internet is when they first out it's like it's got no functionality you got to plug a yellow cable into the back that get it to you know and you've got to call the guy and he's got to send you a four octet number and you've got to and oh by the way there's no security at all built into TCP IP and it'll never be secured and blah blah blah blah blah blah but it was a network that nobody owned so even though like the IBM networks they TNT's network and Deutsche Telekom's network were like radically more functional every new entrepreneur developed on the internet because whatever they built they got all the value for because nobody owned the network and so the internet over time became way more functional than any of those guys networks and in the same way we have a very strong belief in the firm that the ledger that nobody owns is going to be the thing that draws all of the developers and the best payment functionality you know wire transfer foreign currency exchange and all kinds of other functionality that you can't even imagine now just like you know when people thought of the as the internet is like oh it's the electronic post office or whatever well it's not just a post office right like that metaphor is too weak you know electronic money is actually too or money is too weak a metaphor for Bitcoin but we think that you know having financial services platform that nobody owns that everybody can benefit from is going to be a very very big thing as time goes on and I could give you like a million zillion examples of the kinds of things that might be built if something like that existed so yes it's going to fluctuate up and down yes we're in the very early days of it but if I was there are two things like if I was at Stanford the two things I would probably be working on would be their cryptocurrency or biohacking because that that seems to be the two most exciting areas that will develop in a huge ways over the next 20 30 years oh that was good wasn't that was good it reminds me I just had a flashback so mark your partner came when we first did this series in the night I think you and and market just started loud cloud so we were in a building that doesn't even exist anymore oh wow the trial and the day is now is a pond or you know it's not even a pond because there's no water but then he came back a last decade when we were in another building called skilling and was super excited about what you were up to at the time and it then the have you here now in 2000 for today so we have to have you both back sometime that would be something else you know I don't think we've done much together over all the years so that would be exciting would you like to see both of them together sometime we're going to close the deal it's called public come back now we have a deal all right we get time for a couple more let's come up more right here thanks again Ben for coming a lot of students travel into San Francisco Bay Area for school for work for exciting opportunities and it's really an epicenter of technology but we're starting to see like Boris were something Vancouver or other VCs kind of spreading out do you see that changing or is San Francisco the place to be well you show my decode systems can you repeat yeah so the question is a lot of people come to San Francisco now to build companies but there's you know they're kind of mini centers popping up all over and Boris words is like a great VC and Vancouver and then there's you know there's Fred Wilson and the Union Square Guys in New York and so forth so do I see kind of Silicon Valley's importance changing over time so I guess my observation has is that people have been saying that for a while and Silicon Valley seems to keep getting more and more important like it's important seems to have been increasing over the last 10 years when all this kind of activity started not decreasing and the reason really is the network effect so if you if you're the N plus one engineer I was just talking to some very excited entrepreneurs before the talk where are you going to go like if you want to be the best in the world where are you going to go to Vancouver are you going to go to Austin are you going to go to Silicon Valley and most people go to Silicon Valley when they ask themselves that question and so as a result Silicon Valley is still by far the easiest place to build a really important technology and it's you know it's a technology company is not a standalone thing right like you have to understand everything that's going on in Android and iOS and with Bitcoin and you know what's going on in cloud computing and so forth to be competitive it's it's an ecosystem thing and there's certainly nowhere in the world where the ecosystem like you have this kind of ecosystem awareness and then as you go to build a company where are the people who have built companies that are somewhat like it in the past well like most of them are here so like the ability to accelerate the trajectory of your company by bringing talent so not that other people other places won't do it but it is a very strong network effect and the way I was saying like like you could build a move you can make a movie outside of Hollywood you know you can make one in South Dakota but you're not going to get the best director you're not going to get the best actresses you're not going to get the best key grip because they're all in Hollywood and it's a lot easier to make a movie than it is to build a technology company so you just have to kind of consider these things as you think about it now it's not to say that no like I was on the board of Skype which is built in Estonia and like there is some like amazing engineers in Estonia and they built you know and more good companies will come out of Estonia mark my words but whereas like the repeatable like 10 billion dollar market cap like mega companies like most of them I think will continue to come out of Silicon Valley and he looking and then you look at what's going on in China it's quite amazing as well so I'm not saying this is the only place that you can build things but I don't think it's going to lose its importance I know there's a lot more questions but we're winding down what question did I forget to ask or we didn't get to ask you can ask yourself sometimes I ask where we try we're flipping we're flipping this right now what do we forget to ask we cover it all yeah I think we covered most of it was it take to be married for 25 years man you come up here to answer that let's thank Felicia and Ben for being here you have been listening to the draper Fisher-Jurvis and entrepreneurial thought leader series brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technologies Entries Program you can find additional podcasts and videos of these lectures online at ecorner.stanford.edu
