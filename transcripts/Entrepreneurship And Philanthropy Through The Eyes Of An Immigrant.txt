 You are listening to the Draper Fisher-Jurvenson, entrepreneurial thought-leader seminar, brought to you weekly by Stanford Technology Ventures program at Stanford University School of Engineering. I have an incredible pleasure of introducing someone very, very special to me personally today. I'm going to be introducing Mr. Chung Moon Lee. And all of you have his bio in front of you, so I'm not going to tell you what you already know. And he is going to also tell you a remarkable story over the next hour that I think is going to be completely and totally inspiring. In fact, Mr. Lee gave this talk. He came with me to China last summer and gave this talk. And right after what I said, I hope you'll come to Stanford and share this story with our students because it's extremely powerful and inspiring. But the reason Mr. Lee is so special to me is that not only is he a very successful entrepreneur, he's also a remarkable philanthropist. And he is so excited about entrepreneurship education that he endowed my position. So I am the Chung Moon Lee Executive Director of the Stanford Technology Ventures program. And it is my very, very special pleasure to invite him to talk to us today. So the format of today is going to go as father, follows. Mr. Lee is going to give a talk that he prepared. And then we're going to come and sit down in our little living room here. And I'm going to ask him some questions. We'll of course leave some time for all of you to ask some questions to be in. So without further ado, Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee. Thank you very much. Well, thank you very much, Dr. Slig. Good afternoon. My name is Chung Moon Lee. And I like to share with you today that how miserable life I went through. And how hard should I have been in Silicon Valley for 35 years, 36 years now? I'm pleased to share my story of entrepreneurship with you. When I was your age, I never introduced, I intended to become an entrepreneur. I started my career as a school teacher. And I went to the bend of it, National Tinosha, I had a message in library science because I've been grown up in very poor family. And we had tough time having three meters a day. And then in my mind, the only thing I can learn and improve myself is to read a book. I love to read a book. I don't have money to buy it, so I aimed my professionalism forward being a librarian so that I can read the books and the library has. I had a message degree in library science. I thought it's very, very important to country like Korea, those days, to teach young people to read why to read. And you know, we had the slogan of book week in Korea. Problems, answers in the book. Read the book. So I started as a library professor at the college. And then I had a family of just pharmaceuticals, which is half-fri, Chinese, a herbal business. And they asked me to join, which I didn't like it, because as a family of just I had no choice. Thank God all the pharmaceutical industry in Korea. There's a no-one-hat overseas education. I was the only one. Being a library student, I know what to find original source. In the library expensive, I mean extensively, no-one library can afford to buy the books being published. No-one library has enough budget and a facility to store. The no-one library has to buy every book being published. You have to select the book, write author, write topic, and the right subject in the book. With that background, I tried to find original source of the work with the pharmaceutical application causing to the human body. I contacted 11 American European manufacturers. We started producing antibiotics. In 1960, antibiotic is high-tech product in human life. We started to manufacture antibiotic products in Korea. And we explored with the only one in entire Asia including Japan had food and drug administration, Washington, approved our quality and the manufacturing process. We were able to export anywhere in the world. Good price, unlimited market. And then as you know, being a part of family business, I've been running business as a CEO. So I have my brother, he's a CEO. When it comes to important business decision making, even you run your show, you cannot make a decision of your own. You have to consult with the people, people are in the family members. There's elders and all the people and some younger ones. You cannot make a decision without consulting them. And they are not as well as informed the guy like you running show every day. He says, it's very frustrating. So I decided I'll leave this company. I know where to go. So I ended up in Silicon Valley. I started my life exporting American goods exporting into Japan because I had no money being here. So exporting as a broker, I made a pretty good money. I have two kids. I have three kids but two. They're good example. Elder ones are daughter. Young ones are son. So in 1980, I bought my daughter, Apple II machine. You know, Apple, Apple C, Apple II, Apple II II, and then Macintosh. So I bought Apple II II for my daughter. And the younger one is son. The 1981 IBM introduced IBM PC. I bought him for IBM PC because he would be getting into the business. So IBM PC has a more business application than education. And there was the Apple machine or elementary and the secondary education in this country equipped with Apple machine. Apple, Apple C, Apple II, Apple II II. IBM came up the PC in 1981. I went to school, look how does a wonderful machine do. Compil the Apple. And the school district, see Point and their office, they watch the IBM PC does. Well, we do with Apple sitting on here. That's a problem of the entire education of this country. I didn't know this problem. Well, I realized this problem in my family. My son, having IBM PC, always spend until one o'clock and a two o'clock in the morning, a sister's room, what do you do there? Oh, we enjoy the computer. You got a better computer. IBM PC is a better, you know, twice expensive than Apple II. A dad. IBM has great business applications, but not as many as softwares. Apple about us. All really. As a non-engineer, I only knew one thing. That Apple was an 8-bit machine and IBM PC is 16-bit machine. Because I'm not an engineer, just like, you know, just came the idea that, hey, I don't think we can put the 16-bit machine into 8-bit, but I think we can put the 8-bit machine into 16-bit. Plus, IBM PC, if anyone of you recall, first version, earlier version, always had 8 slots in the motherboard. So I realized this might be a great idea getting to business. Running Apple II software on IBM PC. I thought I can save America's education. I started. I was excited. I stopped my exporting videos. I looked around the engineer to hire. I ran into one very bright Korean engineer, like in Korea. I brought him in. I teamed up the team to start with around him. We estimated that hardware can be done within 12 months. Save a half million, the maximum 1 million investment. I think I can afford it. We started. It took six years. Why there are over 100 copyright patents on Apple machine and the software. There were about almost 20,000 software by vendors. Because the food sales app was so popular, we have to circumvent all this copyright patent took six years. I can't tell you now I'm not a smart guy. If I were smart guy, I would have given it up earlier. I'm stubborn enough. I sticked on this. And my family life rattled. My wife telling me you should stop it. You're a good business guy. I know. You ran into a wrong area. You don't know. So I ended up divorced. I had to share half of what I had. My bank account dried up. Credit company took my credit card away. I ended up collecting cabbages. Cabbages are cabbages that are from the grocery store. That freshness is overdue that they have to throw it away. I picked it up. I steamed it. I ate it. No money. No money at all. I had one engineer, a Korean guy, I brought. Everybody left me. My family, my wife, and everybody left me except this guy. Why did you stick with me? He was applying for a green card with my company name. So he cannot live. I promised him. I owed employee tax $480,000. Employee tax. That is not my money. That's government money. Iars came. They showed me a head cup. We came here to arrest you. And what I did, I made a big space. I am trying to save America's edge piece. That's what I do. That's how I spent all my money. I am still stick with it. When this product comes, you will save elementary and secondary education. Always, I do. Our PC clone manufacturer, those days, a radio set, a 10. It was number two, or number one clone manufacturer, and the number two PC manufacturer after IBM. When they make a PC, it goes to school, they show up. The school cannot buy. Finally, after six years of my struggle, radio set came to me. I want to buy your product. Radio set. Number two PC manufacturer, those days. And then eight months later, IBM came to me. I won. You'll product to distribute. By that time, we all went through copyright and patent. I had to hire lawyer with engineer, communicate with the Apple. That's what we have. So we are legally free. We notified the Apple that IBM came to us. We like to distribute your product. So that is how six years of miserable life, loss of fanries, and then being paid off. Thank God, I was just stupid enough to stick with this stupid program. Now, I have to share with you how the young entrepreneurs like you people getting into the business. When I started, the business was showing venture capitalists. The venture capitalists didn't even look at me. You're not an engineer. You don't understand high tech. You don't understand correct or restrictive high tech business. Silicon Valley is a place where monkeys, monkeys, running around the jumping round the tree to tree, monkeys, follow from tree. You're not monkey. You're pocket. You try to climb the tree. You'll never have that. So I said, you know, I see traffic accidents. People being killed by the automobile. We see the statistic all the time, but I don't see any blind. It can be killed by the car. They are very careful. They walk very carefully. I can get all the information I need. I'll tell you about this book later. I know a little about how the Silicon Valley functions. I can't benefit out of this. So I had no venture capital done. I ended up thank God when I had went through the IPO. I raised 126 million with a 30% of my company. I owned a 70%. I gave 30% my employee. I produce a 34 million years out of IPO. And the San Jose Mulkary reported largest IPO in two years. And this came from on October of 1995. There was a larger than us, much larger than us. So working this six years, I served time on, original I started with IBM and the Apple Compatible Computer System. I wanted it. I changed it my cost and then started at own card. So I named I'm on computer systems. From the co-process aboard, after we moved to a graphic window acceleration in 1991. We got into that area, 89, where MS-TOS operating system 5VMPC. In the 1991 Microsoft introduced window. I got into graphic business from co-process card into graphic. There were 18 people there. 18 companies competing each other. I was 18th one got into market. In five years I became number one. I DC international data corporation, even today, they are the center of collecting all this high-tech market intelligence numbers. I DC, this is us as a high-end wind-lexelerator number one brand. Biker understands. Number one brand. I stepped down to five as a CEO. We were number one brand. The IC magazine reported us. We are 17th fastest growing private company in America. And San Jose Virginia reported we are 8th fastest growing company in Silicon Valley. As a non-engineer, I mobilized engineers. I stick with it. They will give up. I saw the end of that tunnel. That probably. Good example for you. I'll mention that. Don't ever give it up. And so I pulled in about four million. But I ended up as I said. 30% of the company could I raise 126 million. So that is good. I'm not going to reward for me. This poor guy cannot leave from Korea. I promised a 10% of the company. First initial IPO, he ended up $12 million cash in his pocket. Exactly 10th year he arrived here from Korea with suitcase. He had $12 million cash. He is still owned. But 6% was 7%. Okay. I have a limited time to go. And if I may, I like to mention about the interprosive education. Excuse me. Today I want to tell you that in many cases, an interprosive should be ready to go through all kind of challenges. To be ready to fight for what he or she believes. And to never give up. The spirit as your as perseverance to overcome these hodars. As a recent church is said, never give up. Never, never. For the 14 years I had the company as a CEO and the three more years as a chairman of the board. The company reached $580 million annual revenue with the 1500 employees. When I was a CEO at Diamond, I walked literally from 7 o'clock to 11 o'clock. I was a automation, countless, sleepless night. People call me 7-eleven. Ten years after that, I was still working with many talented young interprosers. This time as a venture capitalist, which gives me renewed fun and the youthful energy. I love coaching these young interprosers and the sharing, the lessons I have learned about the kind of the problems they might face during their uncharted journey. The focus of interprosive education. Based on my experience, I believe the successful interprosers must be able to look forward with a crystal clear vision. They must be able to make a decision based on their strategic judgment. They must be able to collect and analyze information on the competition and market. They must have great communication skills with customers, investors and stakeholders. This communication in TIEM because the business, there's no guarantee, the communication skills trust among the TIEM with customers, investors, stakeholders. Communication skills. Many young interprosers lacking communication skills. I strongly recommend to read a few books on how to communicate and on how to work with very difficult personality people. The one skill on interprosive education must have is leadership. The second key to success is a dynamic manager style. It ought to be a strong leader and a quick manager. Here are the things I believe you need to do. One, you should be right, optimistic and cheerful in nature. As a French philosopher, Alain says, pessimism is from your sentiment, but optimism is based on your volition, which means willpower. When it comes to the business or athletic game, you should be a tough fighter with a hungry appetite for the success, never yielding in front of any difficulties and any challenges. You also need to have highly strategic approach to every issue in business. If you do not have a strong conviction, you better stay away from running your own business because there's an entrepreneur, there's no comfort zone, safety net security, no guarantee. Two, regardless of the level of your education, you should honestly animate when you are lacking certain skills and try to improve yourself to the extent the level demanded by business. You should consider having a seasoned mentor or outside consultant for specific topics. Three, these can only be evaluated by profit, it generates, in the competitive marketplace. Same as athletic games are counted by the scores. You need to constantly pursue technological innovation with your product as well as the quality of the service, and the position yourself always or head-wavu competition, which is easy to say for many companies to fail to do so. Four, business is there to compete. Just like athletic in a competition for a member. In order to survive a competition, you need to create and create the strategy and the tactics constantly. That means you should always be strategically prepared. You can strike back at the competitor offense with a superior product or service, and by having much better game plan, it should not be guessing game. When I got into the PC Multimedia industry in 1988, there were 17 companies competing with one another in the market, including IBM. I was the number 18 entry member in the already crowded market. Five years later, 93, 94, 95, my product was not my one player in the market. Fine, you will realize that there are various gaps or problems that need to be addressed between the strategic thinking and the daily business realities. That is why the essence of entrepreneurship is a problem solving, including problem analysis, pinpointing solutions and action. Many smart people love to talk, but they always want summoners, grabs, hand-grain, and they sneak into the enemies of bunker and throw at it. Remember, people troubleshoot, techers, current problems, and also deals with a problem. Possibly problems that will show up on the horizon in the very near future. It is like a preventive medicine where you treat the problems before they become visible. It is also very important to detect the optimum way of problem solving in the shortest possible time frame. The truth is, however, in this world where there is no problem, there is no profit. You, only way to produce a profit is to productively solve the biggest problems better and faster than your competition. Sixth, an entrepreneur should have the obligation to produce the best performance every month, every quota, and every year as measured by financial statement. That is why you have to keep changing your strategies and tactics constantly. When you are through the changes, you are through. When you are through the changes, you are through. Also, you should have good relationship with the nurses, customers, employees, and other stakeholders through organizing as well as personal communication. It is also advisable to build up good human network by actively participating in the industry and the community activities and the even. In human life or human race, winning and losing is a matter of a very little difference. For example, take the horse race. The difference between winner and loser is a speed of no-sure head unfinished life, which is razor thin. The other day, I happened to watch the Winter Olympic Games going on in Torino. The American scale won the 5,000 meter speed skating, which is about 2.1 miles, with 6 minutes, 14 seconds. Loser, 60 minutes, 16 seconds. There is a winner, there is a loser, out of 3.1 miles. So, winning and losing is a razor thin. Suppose those athletes to aim the matter. Day and night, you in year-on, see how their physical, mental, exercise, they put their heart and soul for this. If we as our British people, we cannot do like athletes do, but we can do similar to our British lifestyle. Success and the failure is based on your work style and your lifestyle. Again, as I mentioned earlier, if looking for comfort life, don't ever try to get into business. Business may ruin you. I took the similar approach as athletes did. Day and night, struggling to deliver the best product to the market at the best price. There was a how we could deliver the world, the best producing, best product during 1994 and 1995 until I stepped down as a CEO. Despite the fact that building a business is enormous challenge that can take years to a conference, it is an incredible journey. I have learned so much along the way and have benefited greatly from experience. I am so thankful that I went through such a difficult life, not only with money, but humiliating life path with the pains. Which taught me what human life is really about and how to cope with it. You know again, if the weather continues to be fine all the time with no rain for 365 days, then the nature would become what would turn into desert like a Sahara. Heavy rains, snowstorms, gusty winds, all kinds of hardship help you to be a better person. I am sure you will know Frank Snutter's song My Way. What I am trying to say to you today is, I do not do the Silicon Valley way, but I did it in my own way. Thank you very much. Now this is the book I like to introduce you. You may not find the bookshop, but you will find it at Stanford Library. I was a editor with three other qualities. They are all faculty members at the Stanford Silicon Valley age. There are lots of books on Silicon Valley, but this was the book aimed to show how Silicon Valley habitat, the world habitat was called Editor William Miller created this world into habitat, into high tech industry. How the Silicon Valley habitat and the clusters interwoven walk together. There are 26 contributors into this book. They are all expertise in each area. So this is the book. It is the only book I should say. I will tell you how Silicon Valley interacts. I hope it benefits. You can find this book from the library or I do not think you can find this from the bookshop. Thank you very much. I have a few questions for you. As you can all imagine, Mr. Lee is an amazing inspiration and a role model for me. I am so thrilled you could tell the story. I also want to mention, so I do not forget, that Mr. Lee is the chairman of the board of a bank that is in Southern California. He changed the board meeting so that he could be here today and talk to you all today. I know he is taking off and just after this talk to go tend to his other big responsibilities. I want to mention something that you did not talk about. That is your philanthropy. If you do not know, Mr. Lee is one of the most generous people in Silicon Valley. The Asian Art Museum in San Francisco is the Chungmun Lee Asian Art Museum. I know that every time I go to the Palo Clinic, I see the Chungmun Lee Travel Medicine Department and the Urgent Care Department. I know that there are many other things, including myself and my own position, that is named after you because of your incredible generosity. Maybe you could tell us how that spirit of generosity has come to you after all of these years of success. Thank you. I told you I am from Buripua family. We did the pharmaceutical business after World War II ended. World War II ended 18 years old on the Japanese occupation. We had a tough life. I came to the world with empty hands. I struggled. I have been fortunate that when I was in Korea, pharmaceutical business was a very successful. After I arrived here with my ideas, I went to, I had no money, so I went, I had to have a broken and exporting American goods to Japan and Indonesia. I made reasonable very good money, so I went to this high tech business. You know, I have three kids and they all do well in their own area. Even they don't do well, I have no intention to get in her way because I don't know how many Asian students here. Asia, such as China and Korea. In historically, we had no government. Japan, yes, last 300 years Japan had a government to take your people. China and Korea, we had an emperor, we had a king. They don't take care of people. They had no government. That's what Asian people, anything they grab in hand, it has to give to own children. I don't want my children to go through with the same way I struggled. But you know, I rather want to go the other way. I want my children to go through the same way I did. Boy, excited man? More reward. So rather than giving to children, you know, this society here, this is a participatory society. We have to participate. How you made money? Who helped you make money? In this book, last chapter I had, in my chapter, I had a four different interponorship in this book. And then one page I mentioned, why you want to be business people? Why you want to be successful? Rich and famous? I know many people, they ruined their life because they had money and they are rich. And they are famous. Is a rich and famous people can be respected? I don't think so. What is a respectful? So I think we are getting into first verse, what am I going to do with if I'm successful? My suggestion is return it to the society and you will be respected and you will be recognized. So that's what I'm trying to do. And I help people. I like to help people struggling like I did in the past. I like to help people. And so they are not taking six years, if we shorten up in four years and five years, if we put my out. And that's a whole idea. Why you want to be successful? What are you going to do with money if you make? I love that idea that even at this stage in one's life when you're a student you should have an image of once you're successful what are you going to do? And how are you going to give back? So let me ask you a question. As we look around at these students here, what do you wish that you had learned in school? What would have helped you shorten that period of time from six years to four or three or two to be successful? What do you wish you had known? What? You know, I experienced this when I invest, when I invest young engineers, they don't know how to use this money. In other words, they must be priority. For example, I was to buy 150 woke station. When we create the program, we have to test it, 150 machines. They were survived. No, you can rent it. Or you can go to company like Oracle, big place. If you're walkable with it, Oracle product, you can use their lab to test it. There are many ways you can save initial stage. I'll show you my interesting story. After I PO, I received one phone call from somebody named Stan Valentine. I don't know anyone of you understand that name. He was a very big man in venture capital. He was about eight people in Silicon Valley. He was one of eight. He was a cool venture capital. He was number one man there. He called me. I said, who's calling for a Dan? Dan? Dan what? Dan Valentine? Which company are you working with? Is it cool venture capital? Oh no! Yes, you, Mr. Dan, my entire time calling John Moonleek? Yes. Can you have a lunch? Of course. Of course. Of course. You asked me what are you going to do with them? I don't know. Are you going to take a six month vacation? Hell no. I have an idea. Yes sir. You know the SQL basically. Of course. We invest into company. There are more agents Chinese Indians come and roll. We invest. We cannot sit on the board with these companies. You made his words such a loud technology. You built a very good business. He said. So you join me. You don't have to do to the religion. We evaluate technology. You know we are successful venture capital. Of course you are number one number two. We invest ten. In that case we invest eight. You invest two. Sitting on the board. Teach them how to spend money, how to go. I told them at the lunch. I have another idea for you. What is it? So as you said, Asian guys come in very well. There are some successful people. Why don't we all want to be one fund for Asian people? Invest in fund. I will invest in and making and these Asian successful guys will bring more investment opportunity to you because it is a sequer. Great idea. What you did. We did and we were very successful. Make a long story short. They asked me to sit on. As I said today. I am 7-11 type of guy. Once I really want to compete, I compete. I don't give you. I want to see you. I really lose. I really lose. So that I like to work with young entrepreneurs. Let me ask you a question. You are speaking about venture capital. You didn't get these money. You tried. You tried and tried. They basically made fun of you. Now you are a big venture capitalist. How do you do things differently so that you don't make the same mistakes and missing opportunities that they missed? First, I want to understand the fellow who come asking me to invest. Personality. What size of a timbre it is? How this man can grow? When every stage of life people had 100,000, one personality, one of the 5 million out of 100,000 personality changes. 10 million different guy. This guy has a well-rounded personality. This guy has a guts to make things happen. This guy can be one of the stage. He can be turned around as a scared dog. What technology? Technology is what team? Everyone cares that I invest it. Or money ran out. Both directors decided to shut it down. I say no. Because assembling this talent to the people is not easy today. We turned this company around using same engineers with a different product. We made the success work. We sold it to Intel. We see this personality for us. Technology and the team. We see a lot of faces from students around the world. I know you and I have had a lot of discussions about globalization. What do you see as changing now as the world is getting smaller related to entrepreneurship? It's a tough question. Globalization used to be when I was young, when you want to study, you have to go to Germany. The mechanical engineering you have to go to Germany. Literature and then art. You have to go to France. After World War II, 1945, all these engineering studies, medical science, whatever, you have to go to America. Today, those days, from German universe, graduate, or literature, France, or the top nut first class. Today has changed. Even America has changed. So, the name of the game is individual, who that person is. It's not nationality. It doesn't matter what country you come from. For example, there are almost 200 million population countries struggling daily life. 200 million population. But there are countries, 10 million, shining country. You know, there are countries. There's a Belgium, Finland, Norway, Denmark, 7 million, 6 million. But they are shining stars. They are averaging 30,000, 40,000. Their population over billion and award 300 million, 400, 500 million. You make a decision to the level as much as you know. When you have more knowledge, you see further. For example, when you walk in top night, you need a flashlight. When you ride the bike in the dark night, you probably need a candle or flashlight. When you drive automobile, you have to see at least 1,000 feet out, light up. When it comes to airplane, 4 miles from light, top light, the engine size, lighting up the distance. It's exactly come to you. How much you know the world? How much you know how this world functions? You can make a better decision. So, it's a constantly try to improve yourself. If I tell you one of my secret today, I read 15 daily newspaper today. If you see my car, I said junk. I cannot read all day. So, I read it over the weekend. You can imagine how much you journal I read. I had, as she said, you know, I've been borrowing bank. I'm a chairman of the one bank. We are restructurizing this. Somebody wants to be executive VP. I say no. I know the bank. I've been with this bank for 14 years. I know the bank. There's nobody else in the world better than me. No, I agree. You know the bank. You know the bank process. You know the bank of people have worked. How the paper work was? You know better than anybody else. That's not enough. Simply I cannot promote you. You don't read the business journal. I went to your office many times. You don't read the works you journal, financial time, investment, the day business, the healing news and economists. You don't read this. How can you be VP? The president shut mouth up and walked away. You know what? On that note, we will add. I have to tell you, I hope that you have been as inspired by Mr. Lee as I am every single time I get to spend time with him. Thank you so much. Thank you. Really a pleasure. And I want to hand over to Kimber who has a presentation from Bayesian. I would be happy if you could come in and speak today.
