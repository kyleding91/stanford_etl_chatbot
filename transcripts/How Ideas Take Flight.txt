 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader's series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. It is my great pleasure to introduce our guest today. Jennifer Akker is a professor at the Business School and is completely fitting that I met her on Twitter. We both love using Twitter and we found that we were following each other and we tweeting all the same stories and found that we were almost sinking in sink. And so I sent her a message that I think we actually need to meet in person. And I got to meet Jennifer and found that I had discovered one of the true gems on campus. And I think you'll agree at the end of this talk. Jennifer is an award-winning professor focusing on marketing, social networks, and happiness. And I think you'll be as delighted as I've been when I've seen her speak before. Without further ado, Jennifer. Thank you, Tina. So Tina's right. I kind of feel like there's some weird odd soul maintenance. It turns out that I know that's not a word but go with me for a second. So oddly enough, Tina names the same, our names her courses, the same thing. I name my courses even though we don't even know each other. And we find each other's research so interesting and so it's really such a pleasure to be here. Partly because of Tina and partly because I'm such a fan of what we've created here, what you've created with DFJ. I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how ideas build momentum and take off. And that topic is particularly, I don't know, personally meaningful for me right now because my husband and I Andy Smith and my co-author created a book recently that helps unpackage some of our research on happiness and how ideas spread and how to create infectious action, particularly by harnessing social media. So it was really a perfect moment for me to be able to come over here and meet you. So thank you for having me. I wanted to start off by mentioning the dragonfly is the only insect that can fly in any direction when all four wings are operating in sync. So I can go any direction. I believe it's as 50 times faster than a butterfly or any other sort of similarly sized insect. It's a symbol of happiness and transition. And we refer to the dragonfly effect as this idea that small acts can create big change and just create momentum, infectious action. When the meaning of that small act or the body of the dragonfly is incredibly important to you, that the mere thought of what that small act might be would bring happiness at some level and all impact some of these ideas in a few examples. But let me first start with a few of our studies on happiness. We've been doing research in the area of what drives happiness versus what people think drives happiness. For about, I don't know, five, ten years now. This is with a host of collaborators at the GSB and other schools. And I wanted to foreshadow some of the stories that I'll be telling you about today with this research. If you remember anything about this talk and why some ideas can build momentum and why other ideas sort of don't ever build momentum, it would be these three things. Happiness, meaning, and stories. So let me try and back that up. So first, the research on happiness. Happiness drives many of us and yet oftentimes down the wrong road. And it's not till later on in our life or in experience that we realize, you know, sort of how misdirected we actually were based on our own true beliefs. So let me give you a couple of examples. There's three happiness paradoxes that I wanted to see with you. The first most commonly, commonly held belief is that happiness is a single construct. So if I ask you, Jeff, Jeff, are you happy and you say, good. And then I ask you what's your name? Eva? Eva, are you happy? And what would you say? I mean, something to say. You think so? A more contemplative person. I'm not saying that you are not, Jeff. You seem like a very contemplative person. But the idea there is that when you're thinking of happiness and you're saying, maybe yes versus definitely yes, that at some level, we think we're kind of talking the same language that I know what you mean and it's probably something similar or comparable to what Jeff means. And yet we find in some recent research with SEPCOMBAR and KASS in McGilner. And there's work by Jeanne Zai and others that have focused on these two types. There's really two types of happiness. And one is this happiness where if you ask people, what are the first associations that come to mind with happy? You might say excited and pleasurable, feels good and I want something desirable, energizing. And then the second type, so let's call that exciting happiness for a second. The second type of happiness is associated with a very different set of associations. I ask Jeff what's happiness and he says it's actually meaningful and peaceful and content fulfilling. It's simple, maybe even small but fundamental. And let's call that peaceful happiness for a second. And our contention is that when depending on the gender, depending on the age, depending on the culture, that when you ask, are you happy? People are fundamentally giving you the same response, yes and yes, but having two very different conceptions in their heads. Now the second paradox is that we often assume happiness to be stable. So you're making a decision, what's your name? Yeah, yeah. Compana? Compana? And how will do you? Go for it. We won't tell anyone in this, not at all on video. Go ahead. Go ahead. 27. All right, so and you're making decisions, right? You're thinking about jobs or grad schools or houses you might live in, who you might marry or not. And it's based on, this is a little too personal, right? Is this too personal? We'll move away from you shortly. It's, oh, you can hang on. You can do this. So the basic idea there is that you're making decisions based on your current definition of happiness. That's excitement. Excitement happiness. You're going to make decisions based on that. If it's peaceful happiness, you're going to make decisions based on that. And there are very different decisions. What's important in this research, though, is that happiness is moving. So what you're feeling right now at age 27, even though you presume that's the same type of happiness, you'll feel at age 35 and 40. We show that it systematically changes. And there's more nuance ways to think about it. It doesn't just move from excitement at age 20 or 15 or 17 to peaceful, which is age 50 or 60. It's also more nuance than this. This is research by Seb Cavaar and Jonathan Harris in there. We feel fine data set, which is a gorgeous data set. I highly recommend you go to wefeelfin.org or check out their book. It's just an amazing, amazing data set around the world of blogs. What they've done is they've combed the blogosphere and grabbed all mentions of I feel and I am feeling in the blogosphere. So we have 12 million data points to play with what you're feeling, when you're feeling it, how it changes and incoming data is coming in every 10 minutes. So the crawler updates the blogosphere. So now what we can do is we can start to see when you are 27 versus 14 versus 50. What are you saying you feel? As you correlate the I feel happy or I am feeling happy with the other kinds of words, what are those other kinds of words? What are the other kinds of words co-vari with happiness over the course of time? So the first big finding is that for teenagers and young 20-year-olds, happiness really does mean excited. For 40-year-olds, 50-year-olds, happy really means peaceful. Those are the, and it's not peaceful as like a boring way. We've got, you know, a lot to look forward to. There's a lot of exciting things. But it does mean something fundamentally different. Now it's not stable. It does change over the life course. What this is is a depiction of five-year increments over the course of time that shed light on the emotional landscape of 14 to 17-year-olds. What are these people blogging about and when they say they're happy, what do they mean? These 14 to 17-year-olds start out simple. So this is your 14-year-old. You say, how are you feeling? And he says, fine. And what you do today, nothing. There's not a rich emotional vocabulary, you know, behind there. And then you start to creep up into the 15 to 18-year-olds. And then the amount of angst I feel unloved, unnot understood, alone, angsty. Just a tremendous amount of angst perpetuates the blogosphere in that age frame. By the time you hit 23 to 26, 27, you want to conquer the world. So there's a lot of mentions of feeling powerful or where money or the possibility of getting money actually does co-vari with happiness. So you hear that money doesn't always co-vari with happiness. That's not true. For a certain time of life, money or status or possibilities of those things as you move along the trajectory, very much do co-vari with happiness. The problem is you make your decisions around who you might marry or what house you might have or the job you might have. And then boom, your meaning of happiness and your emotional state changes to where you start valuing balance. And then people start blogging about their bodies in the young 30s, perhaps, because it's the first time that they've gone downhill in a big red. And then talking about children and family and connectedness and gratefulness and then happy and calm, one thing we find to be very robust, echoing Laura Carson's work and others, is that in general there is a decrease in angst and unhappiness and therefore an increase in happiness as one ages. And some of you might know that research is done here at Stanford, but the meaning of happiness does fundamentally change. But it's not just a sort of a path along the life cycle. We also show that these meanings of happiness or types of happiness change across conditions. So I'm just going to ask you guys to breathe normally, you're off the hook, just breathe normally. Keep breathing. So that's what you're going to do. For you, I'd like you to start, and ideally for the rest of this presentation, breathe incredibly deeply. So let's all do it together. I'm not even good at this. I'm actually a quick breather. It's not healthy. So you guys keep deep breathing as long as you can, ideally through this entire presentation, deep breathing. Up, down. And what we do is in this particular study is we give those two conditions to two discrete experimental groups. And what we find is the young individuals that were in the control group. We ask what are the first words that come to mind when you think of happiness or how do you define happiness? And they will again say, it's excitement. That's what it means. It's exciting and energizing the fun. For you, even though you're the same age as these individuals, we say what is happiness for you and you define happiness like an older person. You believe happiness is peaceful, contentment, meaning something grounded. So controlling for age, these individuals start to look at life in a very different lens or different way. Not only that, but they start to make decisions in very different ways. So we'll give you guys a choice of two teas. One is both are herbal teas, keeping that control. But yours is a chamomile that's going to be relaxing and yours is a peppermint that's going to be refreshing. And we'll say which one do you want and you consistently ask for the refreshing peppermint tea and you consistently ask for the peaceful chamomile tea that's relaxing. So it has a fundamental impact on the music you pick or the teas you choose or how you make decisions in life. The third paradox is that we think we can build meaning through short-term happiness. We need a mix of short and long-term happiness. And so one thing I often do is I'll run surveys based on the data that comes in from my audience. So I didn't have an opportunity to ask you what is one thing you could do to improve your happiness? But this is a very representative qualitative state of the answers that you tend to get. So I'm just going to let you read it for a few minutes. This is one single thing people could do to improve their happiness. Now, there's two things I'd like to draw your attention to. Beyond the last one, which I love. One is that they're actually all kind of untenable, right? I mean, to some degree, right? I'm going to fix my employer. I'm going to increase free time and the rest time. I'm going to spend more time in Sedona. I'm going to spend more time with good friends. No one says I'm going to spend less time. They're just going to shove more stuff into their life. So there's not this very realistic sense of how they might potentially get happier. But the second thing I wanted to draw your attention to is that in some ways, these small sort of pleasures are populated, just having a little bit more free time or a little bit more time in Sedona. And other times, these more deeply meaningful, long-hard slogs we call them tend to be co-vary with happiness, like actually get a new job. That wouldn't do something. So the answer isn't always that it's something that's short-term fix or long-term fix. It's really having a sense of both of those things and knowing when to pursue one versus the other. So this is work by Leif and Boven and Gillovich. It's a framework that they pull together. I believe it's Leif and Boven and this colleagues. That pulls apart the shallow type of meaning that's fleeting, like for chocolates, versus that's long-lasting, like a nice house. With happiness that has deep meaning, such as giving to a charity or a meditation, versus happiness that's both deep meaning and is long-lasting, potentially having a family or even self-improvement or education. So the answer here there is not again that one type is necessarily always better than the other. It's that you need a mix between these, but you need to be aware of what things you're chasing are deeply meaningful versus short-term meaningful. So based on these three paradoxes I wanted to argue, how might we rethink happiness? And the idea I'd like to put forth is rather than finding happiness, could we create environments that enable that happiness? And what would that look like? And there's a lot of research that starts to show that if we unplug from this goal of finding happiness, that to what is an environment that would allow for happiness, not only to become less self-oriented, but that you actually make decisions and create environments that do correlate with sustainable happiness for you as well as others. So what would that environment look like? There's significant amount of research to show that finding a way to enable people in that environment to find meaning is incredibly important, to fundamentally find connections, and to feel that they're a part of something bigger. There's other factors as well, but these three are sometimes lacking in environments which we're trying to find jobs right now, or even the startups that you're trying to build here at Stanford and outside of Stanford. Now the question is, is this really possible when this is what we're finding ourselves working at? You see the technology, you see the computer, you see the two cell phones, you see the headphones, and here I'm telling you go find meaning and be connected and be a part of something bigger. And this is the environment you find yourself. And in fact, ironically, there's evidence to suggest that we're even further apart than ever before, even though we have technology to bring us closer. Indeed, the paradox of technology is that Twitter and Facebook, even though we have this lovely story about how I now know Tina, because of Twitter, enhanced by Twitter, Twitter, you know, made possible by Twitter. At an aggregate level, we're also seeing a lot of findings that suggest that the more time we spend on technology, even though it was created to connect us, that we're feeling even less connected to especially close others, that we're feeling not in here and now. So are you guys still deep breathing? Yeah? So what you guys are feeling right now, and one reason I like to do this experiment is that this group is always like, they are enraptured by the talk. Not to say that you guys aren't, you lovely talk to. I'm sure you like it very much, but these guys are really liking it. So I like doing the experiment with my audience. And you're present in the here and now, and yet, ironically, we're giving all of this technology to all of us, and we're less in the here and now at an aggregate level. Is technology making us less communal, less patient, less connected? And there is some evidence to suggest that there are conditions under which these trends are indeed happening. Our connections are more electronic, but they need it be less human. We're used to communicate by post, and we can still communicate by post, but something seems lacking. The question I'd like to pose today, and then build on these ideas to talk about ideas that have momentum, that create infectious action, that you can take for your own companies, for your own ideas. Is a simple question, can we build meaning, connections, and being a part of something bigger through technology? So I'd like you to sit without question for a few minutes while I tell you a story about my own self. This was before Tina said we both loved Twitter. Like one year before that, I hated Twitter. I thought it was ridiculous waste of time. My husband, who loves technology, would spend time on Twitter or blogging or playing around with video or trying to understand Google Analytics. And we would have this very perplexing conversation at family dinners. What did you do today? Well, I tweeted, and I played around a little bit with some blogs, and then I'd be like, you're kidding me, really? Honestly? And he would similarly be perplexed by me. You're a marketing professor, what you do today? Well, I tell marketing, do you know anything about social media? No, why would I need to know something about technology? And he would go, you're a marketing professor? Really? Honestly, you have to learn something. And so these were the kinds of conversations we were having. And I would tell him, listen, this is what I see as being the reality of social media. I do not, I think, the more time you spend on these things, the more you go to send to QR, the more we get crazy stalkers hunting us down, and the more that we're experiencing ADHD. And it all changed for me two and a half years ago, right before I met Tina. I was actually a Berkeley teaching at Creativity and Innovation course, and they were just the same women that you teach, right? And crazy. And what I learned over the course of now, 15 years of teaching is that no one remembers my lectures. And I have empirical data to support the fact that people don't remember my content. I email my students one to two years after my classes, and I say, what do you remember for my classes? And they'll be back and say, yeah, nothing. You are a very nice person. And I remember enjoying your classes. They were great. Don't remember anything. And then you go, really, honestly, nothing? And they'll say, oh, I remember. You made us turn on your cell phones, and then work in a learning into the phone conversation when people would embarrassingly leave on their cell phones. If you think you're embarrassed now, you should see how embarrassed my students get when I make them pick up the cell phone. It's horrible. Or I remember, like, chickens don't have lenses. And you taught a case that said, chickens do have lenses. You knew that chicken and lens is ridiculous, innocuous stuff. And so during this class, I said instead of me trying to think, what should you remember for my class, let me crowdsource this and say, what do you remember for my class? And most people sent me one or two bullets, Robert Chauwani sent me a PowerPoint deck. And I just wanted to share with you that deck, one of the basic premises of the course is this idea of reversing the rules. So if you are in a brainstorming session, and you guys all brainstorm an idea, what you'll get is a bell shaped curve of ideas, right? So some of them are really crappy. Some of them are really good. Most of them are mediocre. And if you simply reverse the rules, take every idea that's populated out in the brainstorm session and just reverse it. So let's say you're doing a brainstorm session for Coke and someone says, let's come up with a giant red Coke can and you say, let's make it blue and shrink it. You know, you just take every idea and you literally just reverse it without even thinking. What ends up happening is now you've expanded the bell shaped curve. Now you have a whole lot of really crappy, crappy ideas, like a lot of bad, bad ideas. But so do you have a lot more excellent ideas? And if the idea of brainstorming is to defer judgment and slice off at a later point in time, excellent ideas, now you've got a larger sample size of excellent ideas. And he took this and he thought about how it integrated into his life. Before my class, his best friend, Sumir, was diagnosed with leukemia. Sumir, Stanford undergraduate, started a DOSTY project here for those of you who know DOSTY, a social entrepreneurship minded club here. And brilliant. I mean, he was, you know, I believe an engineer here studying at Stanford went on to all these startups, monkey bin and others. And then he found someone he loved and he married her named Reina. She's right there. And he was diagnosed with leukemia about six months or so before my class in 2007. When they found out that Sumir was diagnosed with leukemia, they reached around, just figured out how they could do it. And they found out a friend of a friend of theirs, Vene, was also diagnosed with leukemia. So it was in East Bay, a red individual who was a Boston doctor at the time, also incredibly young. And this is the PowerPoint deck that Robert shared with me and I'm just going to go through it silently with you. This is Sumir on the lower left and that's Vene on the upper left. They built out two essentially organizations. If you're going to reverse the rules and not find this to be an acceptable situation and said, instead say, we're going to treat this like any organizational endeavor. One single goal, 20,000 individuals. And we'll run that instead of a revenue model. With that being the goal, we'll have 20,000 individuals. They had team, Vene and Sumir. They had marketing leads. They had operation leads. Education. They had local leads. Not dissimilar to the Obama campaign. They built out instant brands. And they didn't have the luxury that many of us do. What is our brand and how are we going to distribute it? They had to put these up immediately and it was so clear what the call to action on these websites were. And they executed like crazy. Every single link here is live. It's a strategy that they created. So if you hear the story and you want to act and you feel like you could, but you don't know how to make a video, you go over here and you click on, how do you make a video and you have a dummy's guide to video creation. Or let's say you work at Cisco and you want to be able to run a drive in Cisco this Friday. But it seems hard and painful and you don't even know where to start. Well, you go click on the donor drives and you find out the dummy's guide to holding a donor's drive. And everything here is cut and paste. So you replace the text and red and now you have your letter to John Chambers. Dear John Chambers, I want to run a drive this Friday. This is what I need to do. Cut, paste, send. Thank you, John Chambers. We ran a drive last Friday. This is how many people we got. This is what we need to do next. Yes, cut, paste, send. Social change in a box, the ability to provide tools and templates for anyone who wants to act, making it abundantly clear and easy and even fun to be able to act. People may widgets, people that never even knew Samir Vene made widgets, people may videos, Indian celebrities that heard this story that wanted to do something with video, a plea or call for action and funny and humorous ways off and times and pop them up on YouTube. The results. The United States. 450 people were emailed, the single email from Robert and it went out to all of these people who ended up forwarding that email on and all of these are bone marrow drives that happened in 11 short weeks. 470 of them spraying up. 24,611 individuals registered in the bone marrow registry in 11 short weeks. A perfect match for Samir was found in that time. Vene had a good match. Samir shared his story from the hospital and he blogged prolifically. He felt so lucky. He found this match, you know, how to live life to the fullest. He talked about happiness. He talked about happiness both in terms of excitement but also in terms of meaning and gratefulness and connectedness and being a part of something bigger. He showed his bone marrow transplant on YouTube so that anyone in the future who is scared of what a bone marrow transplant might actually look like could go and see on YouTube what is it look like. The lessons they learned were fundamental. The power of a clear specific, simple goal. The power of the ability to reverse the rules and instead of what I would have done which is like can I bring you a lasagna? Can I take care of your kids or something like that? They said no we're running this like a corporation. We're going to get 20,000 individuals in the bone marrow registry telling a good and truthful story. The power of stories is what makes people act even well argued arguments are not nearly as persuasive and the opportunity to design for collaboration enabling others to take on the school, Robert and Samir's friends and family, couldn't have gotten 24,611 individuals in the bone marrow registry themselves. You have to design campaigns so your single focus goal is connected to the story which is resounds and resonates with others that hear this within three short months of his bone transplant though. Samir passed on. He fought hard but sadly passed away and that's a picture of Samir and Reina and they celebrated his life by sharing his memorial service with the world and 6000 people saw his memorial and then they had a successful transplant that relaxed and he went through alternative treatment and passed away a few months after Samir. The reason I'm telling you this story and the reason why I was so fundamentally impacted by this story is that the purpose revealed from the 24,611 donors that were registered 266 people were matched just in one year based on the 24,611 registered. That's 266 people who had hope that had an immediate match. As many of you know the power of a match is not so much this just whether it's perfect match. It also depends very much on how quickly you get the match and that will also have a significant impact on whether you survive. The chances go up to 75% survival rates on average if you can get an immediate perfect match versus you have to take a long period of time it can drop to 40%, 40%, 50%. It's a world of difference if you can get it immediately. As I was listening to this presentation all I could think about was what do I do now? Could I water this with this story grow and how would that make me feel and all I could think about was happy? We took that story and when we came back to Stanford we wrote a case on it so anyone can download it freely and figure out how they can do social change in a box and then we taught a class where we teach MBAs and design students and non-GSP students how to use this type of model to grow their own ideas and we encourage those ideas to be not based just on profit models but based on social good in the world in part because of Samir and Vene and the first words out of Samir and Vene's mouth actually what after they got the 25,000 was let's get another 25,000 and you can imagine Robert going like you're kidding me like we just got 25,000 people and a perfect match for you and you're saying go get another 25,000 to save other lives so what we did with that legacy of both of them is double it and say can we get 100 and 1000 sheiks swabbed in the next year and students here at Stanford and corporations are participating at it and I think it's just incredibly powerful to think about how you take legacy something that would truly make someone happy and how do you design for the ripple effect. I wanted to back out the four wings of this Dragonfly model which came from this core story which I think shed light on what ideas build and have momentum which ideas don't. The first is focus. Team Samir did not try and get everyone in the registry. What they did was they took 20,000 South Asians. They focused on well-connected families, people that were parents those who could easily relate to the story. I mentioned you that Robert sent out a well-crafted email telling the story and what people could do to help to 450 people just 450 people and that is the email that when extended to other people who were connected to these original 450 people could spread it. The design principles associated with focus is it has to be humanistic so these people that are focused on brand or product or competitor that's where the goal doesn't get as much traction but when you have a human centered goal like what would Samir want, what would be good for Samir that's when goals actually create life and it has to be actionable and testable and clear and happy. The mere thought of achieving that goal would bring you a peaceful kind of happiness is incredibly powerful. There's a lot of research on emotional contagion. So if you're chasing a goal that you believe would make you fundamentally happy there's actual energy not dissimilar to time and money as a resource. The mere thought of actually achieving that goal that would bring you happiness or meaning is a resource that's oftentimes not unleashed in many campaigns. The second wing is you have to grab attention. This is designed to get some of the attention essentially a hammer. In the case of Samir and Venei they made it so that people turned and looked because they felt like they might know Venei. Robert this is Venei's wife and these are Venei's friends and you could see if you are a social Stanford entrepreneur. You could see yourself in those pictures and Robert gave Samir a baby at the moment and said here hold the baby I'm going to take a picture that's the only not truthful part of this story. But the idea is that you can see yourself in every one of these pictures so it makes you look and the design principles here is that it has to be personal and makes you feel like it's speaking to you and unexpected and visceral makes you feel something and visual makes you look Lance Armstrong owns yellow and coke owns red and breast cancer owns pink and these colors aren't just simple branding campaigns that are throw away they make people look and then after people look then they decide do I want to get engaged and that is the third wing engagement. Humans are not set up to understand logic they are set up to understand stories in the case of Samir and Venei the stories were told not just on the website which is less emotional but through video and through word of mouth. The design principles here are what are the stories that why you created your idea why you were here at Stanford why are you building up this startup what are those stories and those stories as assets is an under leveraged tool authenticity this idea of empathizing and being authentic is increasingly important you're seeing people distrust for profits they're distrusting nonprofits they're distrusting corporations and governments right now what people trust right now are their friends and that's one reason why social media has taken off so much so what is an authentic message and the last thing is enable others to take action. Here this idea is how are you designing campaigns so that others can act in the case of Samir you know it was social change in a box it was tools and templates that made it so easy if you wanted to do something you could a good litmus test of whether you nailed this is do others do other things that you don't expect but are absolutely helpful for you. I wanted to do the design principles are just whether it's easy and fun and tailored and open the psychology behind ideas that create infectious action is twofold one theory is the ripple effect that small acts can create big change Malcolm Gladwell recently wrote that there's times in which social media is potentially a distraction that actual revolutions and actual infectious action happen on the ground and that is absolutely true in this case people maddening the back with a bone marriage cheap swab table and she is on the ground rather than oh I'm going to have to I'm going to have to do it I'm sorry you have to answer the phone work in some learning into the phone conversation you can do this you can totally do this really so close and yet so far all right you're off easy this time but the next time it rings you're working in learning one thing that's kind of interesting is that Anglo-Americans have a heart they have an easier time believing that something that you do could have spread and in fact they believe it should have spread in other Asian countries to a greater degree they don't believe that as much but they do believe that small acts right now might have a big impact later so if you recycle this water bottle right now it might not improve the environment right now but later it might and I think long-term decision-making and one reason why individuals especially in individualistic cultures have a harder time with thinking about that as basic ideas around what you believe is possible with small acts the second theoretical paradigm that helps underlie these infectious actions and movements is emotional contagion fowler and kastakas and jankas yopo and others talk a lot about emotional contagion it refers to the tendency to catch or feel emotions not to similar to viruses in fact people who are happy boost the chances that someone they know will be happy with their friends friend is happy has more influence than a five thousand dollar raise one person's happiness can affect another's for as long as one year and by the way negative emotions are also contagious and there's evidence to suggest there even more viral which has implications for cultures and which you're cultivating your startup idea what kind of environment are you trying to enable what environment are you allowing for happiness so these are the four wings of the dragonfly and it's not cute here you go I wanted to share a story that's a little bit lighter than just some year and then I'm going to close with some thoughts around happiness and around technology and around stories this is coca cola so let's say you're out there in the world and you say I get how this works for smear I get how it works for Robert I know where to go for resources but you know I've got a brand or I've got an idea and I want to spread it I want it to go viral I just wanted to tell you a small case study about coca-cola which had an idea and they had a single focus goal they really wanted to connect with teenagers globally with the flagship brand with coca-cola and they wanted to do so through digital media that was our hypothesis is that we're not going to be able to connect with individuals globally unless we do it through digital media now most companies at this point would say okay we've got our $350,000 marketing budget go give it to our marketing team go make your viral campaign but instead of doing that what they did was they divided the world up into seven teams and we said we're giving you $50,000 each and so you guys are all going to get the single focus goal and try and make you know an an authentic an organic viral campaign you're not going to engineer you're not going to SEO this thing you're going to have it authentic an organic now what's interesting is that six out of the seven groups failed in the sense that nothing really took off and that's a very healthy normal statistic that's why rapid prototyping and and you know feeling faster is oftentimes sort of an MO that many people here in the valley and other places are taking on because it allows you to start experimenting the winner though of this was the co-capiness machine and I'm just going to show it to you let's see so I tell you this story because um let's see um forest why you come put it up thanks um I tell you this story because um even though they only spent $50,000 on that video um and you know they hid it in college campuses not just somewhere to Stanford at finals time thank you and um when people were really depressed and they had these hidden cameras and everything came out and it was all very authentic it was authentic it was a surprise um but they designed it with a large part of the dragonfly model uh in mind the result in two weeks and it was a organic search just one tweet out share the hot pinnest spread the video no engineering the virality it was all organic and they wanted that they wanted not to they know they can engineer it they know that they can figure out how to push things out they wanted it to be natural and so it was two million views on YouTube in two weeks um uh it was global 50% of viewers were outside the US and 70% of the blogs were not English 95% of the blog posts were positive comments which as you know is unheard of uh I'm a pepsi-duaker I might make this switch and there's some evidence to even suggest that it was tied to actual choice and preference um what's so interesting I think about this story is that you know they had a lot of footage like 12 hours of footage and they sliced out the personal smiles like you smiling they would have cut that right they took it when the four of you were smiling together and that you were sharing the coke and so this emotional contagion the shared emotion um that spreads I mean you guys should have seen your faces you were all laughing and you weren't even there um and this idea of a single focus goal and being able to grab attention through unexpectedness and um feeling like oh I could be there uh and telling a story and an aboling story to be told they didn't architect it for the last wing that well which is enable action not as much as like you know uh the old spice guy or whatever yes those of you had answering machines or phone mates or whatever voice messages with a old spice guy you made it your own there's a lot of campaigns that allow you to make it really honestly all right I'm letting you off the hook this time but if I hear one ring I'm diving in somewhere over there you guys are a notice are you still deep breathing yeah okay um so this idea of how do you enable action it's led to a big campaign around open coke or open happiness I believe and you know there's a lot of companies right now that are doing a great job in making things open including open idea which is I think a beautiful initiative um so what I wanted to do is just give you a few thoughts and closing um stories connect us and if you remember one thing from this talk it might very well be um ideas build momentum when you have a story and you share that story and that story resonates with others and then they come along for the ride um or they build their own stories on top of yours uh often more than we expect humans are not ideally set up to understand logic they're uh set up to understand stories um but stories and connections are everywhere even here um but connections are often not made by maximizing profits and there's wonderful research by Kathleen Boss and her um colleagues to show that people when prime to think about money step away from others we need to foster environments that enable us to build meaning to make connections to be a part of something bigger um by leveraging technology and I would argue to you that your ideas that build momentum to the degree that their technology oriented or leveraging technology if your core story and your single focus goal has meaning and that meaning resonates with others such that they can easily act with you those are the conditions where social technology and media can in fact enhance meaning and connections and being part of something bigger and you're not tweeting about what you ate for breakfast in the morning but you're doing something that has meaning and even asking yourself right before you go you know tweet or you go use the cell phone or you go pop on email is what I'm doing have meaning and that being um a decision criterion before you choose the tea or what to do right now I think is very powerful because I do think and I am a big fan as Tina said of social media and then the context in which these things can be used for cultivating meaning a connections and being part of something bigger I am absolutely amazed by and I feel it enriches my mind I think all we need to do is design for these ripple effects that one small meaningful act taken when connected to others can drive massive change um I mentioned that we took the story of Robertson made it into a class then a book and a hundred thousand cheek swabs in honor of Bo Samir and Vene who wanted to double their 25,000 we said how beautiful would it be to get a hundred thousand people into the bone marrow registry and potentially even go to India in December and try and help the efforts there to actually create a national bone marrow registry to build and design an uh an effect that perhaps just perhaps and even one or two years could actually save the lives of potentially or get more than a million people in that bone marrow registry so with that I just wanted to conclude and if you are inspired by the way to do a quick cheek swab in true dragonfly and Samir and Vene fashion we have a table outside it takes five minutes and if you're 18 to 20 or 50 or 60 you can do it and it it um it gives hope immediate hope but it's not just the possibility of saving a life and the technology to do bone marrow transfers surprisingly is so much easier than we think but it gives you the gift gives people the gift of time so on that note I wanted to say happiness um and transition and I hope your ideas all have momentum thank you very much that was terrific then first so we have time for about ten minutes of questions ready to do that great great so who has a first question over here well here this afternoon I received a forwarded email there's a son of a woman and he did look before one marrow yeah so son jonna is a 41 year old woman I'm about that age too she is eight year old twins I have eight year old twins and she has been finding trying to find a bone marrow match for two years and it's coming it's it's not good right now and so we've been working with team son jonna intensely for the next last two months and in fact that's one reason we're going to India to find her a match she's on compassionate care treatment as of this week and we need to find a match in the next couple months if if that so thank you for bringing that up it's a problem right now and we need to solve this problem it's it's not a hard problem to solve and we need to do it not just for her but for her eight year old twin another question so yes over here a question when when you talked about coat one of the things she said was they wanted it to go viral organically and simplistically and they even though they could engineer it they found that they they wanted to do it the other way what was the reasoning behind that yeah so when they had that 350 thousand they gave the team the 50 grand to go do something they wanted to learn from it and even though they only spent 50 thousand dollars for that video these spent I think it was like a quarter million or half million the market research to understand why that went viral the irony right and and you see this too Google y'all who everyone's trying to understand why it who are the influencers and you know what goes viral and there's all these hypotheses and it's amazing how difficult it is to predict these things but they wanted to understand what was organic for us and we can always amplify things but what was organic to us and that means and for those of you who are doing startups right now what do you stand for what resonates what is going to both make people look but also potentially in their case spread happiness and so they just really wanted to they didn't they didn't want to spend their money on something that they know I don't want to say it's artificial but it was engineered and the money that they can make and the money that they could save by doing something that was totally organic and then watching you know where it went and why it happened was so much more powerful of an exercise for them by the way I just want to PS all of these individuals chasing the influencers one thing you see in social psychology research is the people that persuade it's not so much that you know you're sitting around like you know you you send out one tweet and everyone listens right I mean there is some heterogeneity and individuals there but it's that you have influence within a domain so like let's say you're a cancer expert or you know a Koch expert or an athlete or you know influencers are domain specific and I think individuals need to start thinking much more about the domains of influence and the power of potential weak ties especially with these meaningful campaigns so you said like we don't trust companies we don't trust governments right now we trust our friends but then the way things are going is like with companies trying to figure out who are the influencers or the friends who are going to be well trust our friends yeah yeah no no you cannot for there's a few or a few or a number I know so so yeah and that's another reason why they wanted to do something Jeff organically because what's happening right now and in fact I even think I have a graph I just like to show you is that oh by the way this is kind of fun research this is with Kathleen Boss and Cassie McGillner we show that if you tell people this is a you know messenger bag from Mozilla.org and I tell you it's from Mozilla.com you think Mozilla is really competent and you think it's warm and inspiring but completely incompetent and needy and you think it's competent and effective Mozilla.com but greedy and not trustworthy so there's these incredible stereotypes that are coloring the ways where and by the way they only want to buy the bag from the competent company but they've got this distrust toward the competent company and the question is kind of how do you bridge the gap what what you're seeing right now is more and more brands that have that have a strong brand a strong idea for employees so these companies are building brands inside out when the company is founding principle and beliefs in the story of why you exist is sound and employees are so excited about the brand with social media which makes it more and more transparent how are you marketing this what do you really stand for you know if yeah as these things become more easier to find out what the real goal is you're finding that the stronger brands are those that are not just customer facing and haven't just built up a brand identity and a set of assets and touch points with all their customers that are disengaged from their internal employees and why they were founded you're finding stronger brands are built inside out where the the in the brand inside is so powerful and then eventually that is disseminated to customers such that they when customers hear about some brand action it's easier to trust that brand so I didn't do a great job of head-on answering your question but I will say that companies that have their head around this can start to cultivate trust and when they do engage a potential friend or one a friend does potentially tell others I really believe and leave eyes or whatever it is they're more likely to resound so it's kind of an indirect answer another question well let me ask you a question yeah I always think of Twitter's a wonderful way to do lots of little experiments right you put things out and you quickly can see what things get picked up and propagated I'm going to guess you have the same experience what have you found in your experiments as you have been using Twitter and other social media over the last year yeah so we found that the brand well I don't do too much experimentation yet because of a lot of different reasons but I follow brands that do like Dell or JetBlue or Starbucks and you know there's different reasons to be using it one is you know you got your discounts to Starbucks right and if you listen then you get cheaper Starbucks but then it's really interesting to see like Zappos start talking about you know interesting tidbits or kind of surprising insights or something that makes you laugh or something that brings happiness so Tony Shea has a very different philosophy I'm not going to just like tell you you get 10% off at Zappos I'm going to create benefits that are not just price focused and what I think you're seeing is that's really fun is that companies that do allow experimentation by personal individuals the personal brands are being built so people are having their own little brand following and then they tweet out and they have their own personality and that kind of adds and amplifies and increases authenticity and trust and so I think that's so interesting is when companies allow personal individuals within the company or customers JetBlue let the terminal man have you guys heard this JetBlue did a 599 thing last year and I guess again this year all you can jet you buy 599 you can go anywhere so terminal man he's self branded himself terminal man bought this 599 thing and he decided he was going to spend one month never leaving terminal so he flew all over the United States never leaving a terminal and he would blog and video and he became this celebrity and these you know media's would follow him and then he started commenting on JetBlue service like sitting in the first class right now not too shabby you know and then the pilots would come talk to him and then JetBlue actually didn't just like sort of try and you know silence him to some degree they talked him like you didn't like this why didn't you like this they brought him to his leadership conference and he spoke and said you people are doing it all wrong let me tell you we should do they there's some companies that are hiring these types of people so I think that honestly it's crazy and so I think companies that experiment and allow personal voice to bubble up and experiment there are going to be so far ahead of companies that don't allow experimentation that is well I want to end by saying first of all for anyone who's interested the Stanford bookstore is outside with copies of your book and also you can get your cheeks swabed and I want to end by saying you know what this talk may be really happy thank you so much
