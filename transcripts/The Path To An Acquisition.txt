 You were listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at edcorner.stanford.edu. I'm really excited today to be able to introduce somebody whose work as an entrepreneur has actually changed my life and changed the life of a lot of us who are always wondering how our favorite websites are doing on the web. His name is Brett Crosby. He's an entrepreneur who actually started life as a surfer. He says he learned to surf in Southern California, Orange County, in San Diego. I'm not going to tell you anything more about him because he's a guy who I'd really like to have you learn about through his own discussion of his exploits. So Brett, welcome to Stanford. We're delighted to have you here. Thank you for your trust, Bing. Wonderful. Thank you, Tom. And thank you, everyone. My dad went to Stanford. My grandma went to Stanford, so I didn't go to Stanford. But they would be very happy to see me here. And I'm sure they're looking down somewhere and being very happy about this. So speaking to Stanford students. So I'm Brett Crosby. I'm currently the group product marketing manager for Google Analytics. And this is what Google Analytics looks like. We do all kinds of wacky things. This is a map, although you can't see it very well. We tell you where your visitor has come from. I'm just giving you an idea of what analytics is because it's kind of key to the talk. I'm not trying to pitch you on the product here. So anyhow, it tells you how people got to your site, kind of what they did on your site. This is showing some funnels of how traffic goes through your site. And if they then convert on one of your goals. And then we also overlay it over your site and all kinds of other great things. But again, this is this talk today is one of the few ideas that isn't about Google Analytics. Usually all my talks at trade shows and other places are about this. Today my talks about Urchin. And how we went from this small company in San Diego, Urchin to Urchin from Google. And then now Google Analytics. And these four characters are key to the story. Two of them are here today. I'm over there in the light blue and this over there. And then my brother, who's over on the far corner, is in the far corner of the room. That's Scott Crosby. He also works at Google because we were all acquired together. And so I'll answer some of those questions about that. But I'll also answer the question about why. About half an hour before I walked down the aisle at my wedding, I was signing the papers to sell Urchin to Google. What fully in my texito, the Pacifico on one hand, cold feet on the other. Trying to warm up. And why one year after we were acquired, I was doing this surfing on a surf trip in Indonesia. With a bunch of my buddies on a boat for two weeks. That's definitely worthwhile if you haven't done it. But this is the Urchin story. So I'm going to focus on that a little bit. It all started here. This is a photo from when we were kids. Who can guess which one I am? Anyone? This guy here? No, I'm the guy in the cardinal. Come on, this is Stanford presentation. This is me. It's really USC colors. See that? That's actually where I went. Anyhow, but this is my brother Scott. You can see the whole Urchin and Fish theme. It was early on in our childhood here. And this guy over here, it turns out, was one of our other co-founders. And CEO at the time. This guy here. His name is Paul Murey. We're standing on our driveway as kids. Paul literally lived right here across the street. So the reason I want to point this out is, you know, this is our kind of founding story. But, you know, your founding story may be very similar. You might start the company with some of your friends, some of your family members. Very possibly some people that are in this class here today. One of the other guys we added, if I back up a slide, this guy here, Jack Ancon. He was a fraternity brother of mine in college at SC. And a great guy, a very smart guy he was doing. I don't know, real estate finance for these huge corporate deals and stuff that we pulled him into the company. So, in the beginning, what happened with Urchin? Well, before there was Urchin, we started out doing a company called Web Depot. And actually, Scott and Paul had started this company before I ever got on board. I was up in LA doing some other stuff in the web space. And they were building websites. And I was disenfranchised with LA and I moved down there and said, all right, let's do some websites. And I already sent them some business. So, we started working together. And we built Urchin as an internal tool to monitor bandwidth. Because back then, bandwidth was really expensive, right? And now bandwidth is pretty cheap and you can get it everywhere. But, back then, that's how Urchin started. We were doing site design and hosting out of a closet. This is about 95, 96. When you could do that, before all the huge data centers kind of came out and that whole thing. And then we became quantified web systems. We sold off the other parts of the business and focused on Urchin. We had built this tool and really how we made the transition is that a lot of our customers attended to be some fairly big sophisticated customers in San Diego. Other agencies in LA and stuff had heard about us, like Rubenpuster, Interactive who does all the Honda advertising. They had heard about the scalability of this product. And they were doing things like, you know, Honda was spending, I think it was like $6 million a year online at the time. And they had no idea what the return was. In fact, they were using other log file analysis products that would read the logs, take over 24 hours of data process and provide information. And there were six months behind. So they were spending all this money, had zero visibility, even how much traffic they were getting to the site. They heard that we had this product that was super fast. And we said, yeah, try it out. We haven't tried it commercially yet. Just for our own use with our customers. And they said, you know, the log story short with that is that it worked very well within two weeks. We had them fully caught up and it took about an hour, a data process. So we knew we had something. We said, wow, of all the other kind of analytics, analytics products in the space, and it was called, there was no real term for the space at the time. But all these other products were very, very slow. And we had something very, very fast. And a large part of that is that this guy back here, Paul. You know, when we were all in like elementary school, Chuckling around, taking some math courses, learning our multiplication tables, he's going to junior high already doing math. And junior high is going to high school, high school. He's going to the local community colleges doing math or UCI, I think, maybe at the time. By the time we got to UCI, he was doing like work for NASA grants and that sort of thing. So very, very bright guy. He did the foundational engineering on the project. Another thing to think about if you're an entrepreneur on the business side, get some smart people on the engineering side. It helps. So that's sort of the beginning and how we became quantified. And then later we decided to change the name to Urchin Software Corporation. We thought quantified would be good because we might have, you know, or the people we're looking at at the time were like a macro media and Adobe and software companies had multiple suites of products. Nowadays, you look around, everyone's got one product, it doesn't matter. But back then it seemed like everyone had these suites of products. We experiment with a suite of products and we found that we could barely focus on one wall enough to do a really good job with it. So we dropped those other ones and just focused on that. And this is where we office down in San Diego. We did our own tenant improvements. There's a photo of that and then sunset. I think Scott took these photos a long time ago. I don't recommend doing your own tenant improvements. We spent about, I don't know, three months. We pretty much shut down the business and just at night we would do a few emails. And we were doing drywall and the whole thing. Breathe in dust. You know, we had these brick walls that we wanted. There's paint on them. We wanted the brick look. We sanded down the brick and, you know, I'm sure we've got pink lung from doing that. I don't recommend doing that. But the way we really started to succeed as a company, we first actually started to have something. We focused on Urchin and we started selling. Actually our first kind of big customer was this thing called NetTaxi and I'll show you that a little bit later. But then it was Earthlink. And this is back in like 97, 98 when Earthlink was huge. Everyone thought Earthlink was like, can be just huge then. Their stock price was skyrocketing. They were kind of like AOL on Earthlink. You know, we're kind of comparable on, it's funny where things are now. But nevertheless, I got Earthlink by literally typing on their web form. Hey, we have a product we think you should take a look at, blah, blah. I wrote up this great email. I thought it was really well crafted. Put it in the web form. No response. A week later, copying and pasting it back in the web form. No response. My third time I did it. Exactly the right guy on the company I needed to talk to. He emailed me back and said, send me a demo and a white paper. That's it. And so we didn't have a demo and we didn't have a white paper. But pretty quickly, within a few, you know, a day or two we did. And so then we got it to him. And then we set up some meetings and, you know, that deal probably took about six months to finally ink. And that was our first really big deal. And what it proved is the scalability of the product. They had something like a quarter million or so at the time customers doing hosting. And we were able to process all those customers within a day. And then they had like a million customers on a free farm. So they paid us for the paid customers, the installation is there. And we tried to do a banner ad model on the other ones, which was kind of our early business model. I was going to touch on it later, but I'm going to talk about it now. And you know, who would have thought like banner ads or, you know, advertising could support a software company. Obviously, it's a ridiculous notion. But we finally perfected it at Google, I guess. I don't know. But anyhow, so at that point, we actually when we had Earthlink, then we shifted. And we had a fully paid for product. And we didn't do any more banner ads in the product. And then we were working with cable and wireless right about the same time that Earthlink closed. The interesting thing there is that they were hosting massive sites and the other, or massive amounts of data. But instead of like a ton of small sites, they were hosting extremely large individual sites and a lot of them. Guys like, you know, American Airlines, Coke, the Gap, really big sites. And we proved our scalability there as well. And the cable and wireless deal was our first huge revenue deal for our company. It was a, for us, it was a huge revenue deal. It was a seven figure deal, it was a million dollar deal. And that, for us, became the model for how we would do deals. We would go to these really large data centers. And we would say to them, hey, we've got this great product. Your customers needed. The more savvy your customers are, the better they're, you know, they're going to do online. And that they're going to be upsold from your copper package, your silver package, just here. You know, our bronze, silver gold package, right? And so the host really liked this idea. And so they would provide these services to them. One other incidental thing is that, I don't know if you saw it. This is one of our ads that we're looking at right now, showing off who some of our customers were. Does anyone recognize this artwork here? Well, no, yeah, well, it's sort of like a take off on that. But I'm talking about the artist to kind of do this. It's a very particular style. It's definitely more kind of like a college thing. But the same guy who did this poster, Shepard Ferry. It's not Obama. It's a Shepard Ferry. The artist who did this. And incidentally, the way we got him to do our ads is, first of all, I build his first website for him. He didn't have a website at the time. And then we hosted it, and we did it in trade. And this guy's gone on to, I don't know, he's the guy that does the obey giant stuff. No one? Anyone? Help people? You guys are hip. The rest of you. Come on. Get with it. Yeah. No, but, you know, he was a really good guy. He's a friend of ours still. And, you know, obviously, he's gone in place. He's done ads for, you know, all these major companies. A lot of things happen in our history. Before the .com crash, we have kind of an interesting story. What we have here is a photo of the Winstor blimp. And to me, this epitomizes the .com bubble. And there's a reason for this. Not only was it because, you know, people are out there buying blimp's. But when we were negotiating a deal with Winstor, we had this multi-million dollar deal over multiple years. And it was a contract that took us probably eight months to negotiate. We were into the very fine points of the deal. And they were trying to rewrite the contract in the final hour. The guy he was negotiating at Jack on our team was literally, it was like two days before Christmas. He was trying to fly home. He was in tears trying to get this deal done. It took two days. And of just like negotiating over like, you know, what does is mean or something like that. Meanwhile, the blimp is circling our houses the entire two days. I can't imagine it was anything but coincidence. But like, you know, we would walk outside and there's the blimp. And he's on the phone with their deal guys. And there's an . . . who knows. Maybe they had . . . it's Telco. Maybe they had the phone information. I don't think so. I just think it was a total coincidence. But to me, it was like one of those things that were like, you know, one day we'll look back at this and laugh. But what happened shortly thereafter was actually very tragic. Of course, 9-11 happened. And we, you know, the thing about 9-11 for us is that we were in the middle of a . . . a funding round. And so Nali was obviously super tragic and everything else. The guy that was going to . . . our deal was inked. It was papered, completely done. The guy was flying out to sign and finish the deal. We moved the meeting up one day. He flew out on September 10th from Boston. And he, you know, woke up in the morning when we went to go have the meeting. And he's like, we're done. And so, like, deal over. We were like in the red. All of the senior people in our company had focused on getting the deal done. Not focused on, you know, the revenue of the company. Because we're like, yeah, we got all this money coming in. What do we care about that for now? Right? Because we're going to burn into the red anyway. So what, obviously, what happened for the entire country, but definitely for us, it was a pretty dark time, right? So we, we had layoffs in our company. We had a Japanese office of like 20 people. We had to cut that office. And we retooled all of our business models. We, Scott and I both took salary cuts down to, I think, about $40,000 a year or something like that. For about a year. Yeah, it was rough. It was rough times. But what came out of it was actually pretty positive because two things are interesting. We retooled all of our business models and we took what used to be like six months of negotiations per data center deal and chopped it down to, and it was about like a 30-page agreement with all kinds of clauses. And this and that and all this crap. We, we chopped the whole thing down to two page, like a one sheet of paper, front and back, sign done. No negotiation. We gave on all the points that people were negotiating us on. It was $5,000 per physical data center per month. You have as much urgent as you want. So our goal was not to get every dime out of every customer. It was to be the most dominant Web Analytics product on the market. And to do that, we had to make it really scalable. Not only from the backend technology, but also from a front end perspective. We had to make it so that the user using the product could get in there and actually understand what they were doing rather than, you know, having to call us every 10 minutes and say, what does this mean? How come, you know, whatever? So we built in all kinds of help into the product and, you know, tried to make the product really intuitive and, you know, something you could just run yourself. We also came out with, after several meetings with people up here in the valley, it became pretty clear that installed software was not necessarily the way to go. And that's, that had been our model for a long time. So we switched, you know, these seemed like really dumb and obvious ideas, but at the time it wasn't quite so obvious. But we switched. It started to become very obvious to an ASP model. And that's where we needed to go. So that's what we did. And we became pretty dominant. We had all the major hosting companies using, using urgent and many of them still do. My name is still provided today. I'd say it's still the most dominant on the market. The other thing we did is we started to mature our brand. And the important thing about maturing the brand for us is that we started to use the things that we had at our disposal. And this is something that would definitely suggest anyone. Get a good copywriter and get a good graphics guy. You want a graphics guy who can do website stuff, who can do print ads, who can do collateral and stuff like that. You need to have, you know, if you can get someone who's really good and you can elevate the look of your company and get a decent trade show booth and get out there and start speaking, getting on the circuits, you can start looking a lot bigger than you are. And it's just important because people take you a lot more seriously. I'm sure there's a lot to talk about with that. Anyhow, here we, moving on. I should point out the reason I have this slide about the trade show booth is this is actually how we got acquired by Google. We were at search engine strategies in San Jose in 04. And this guy walked up to the booth with this other guy whose age was very hard to pinpoint. Turns out the guy was 24 years old at the time. They walked up to the booth and they said, hey, we're from Google. We're kind of interested in what you guys are doing. Can you show us some of this stuff? And I happen to be working at the booth at the time. And so I said, sure, let me show you this stuff. I said, you know, by the way, I know Google has a competing service called AdWords Conversion Tracking. You guys don't work on that right? Oh, no, no, we don't work on that. Well, it turns out this guy was the PM for that product. And the other guy was a corp dev guy and they're like, no, we're just, you know, kind of doing some business development. We're just interested in what you're doing. So I told him exactly what we were doing and give him all kinds of secrets, which had I known what they were really doing. I wouldn't have told him anything. But that wouldn't have worked out so well either. So what ended up happening is that we went to Google later that afternoon right before what is called the Google Dance, which is this party that we host every year at Search Engine Strategies, which I had attended a couple years before and was trying to tell people, hey, you guys should acquire us. No one will think, yeah, whatever. And then it turns out this guy came along, Westy Chan, and he actually had the vision in the foresight that Google should be in the Web Analytics business. So we went to Google for this meeting. I was so, you know, I was, I had been presenting in meetings for several years. You know, we've been doing this for, but at this point up until about eight or nine years been doing this type of thing. I got that meeting, I couldn't say a word. I was just so nervous because of the possibility of what this could turn into. And this for us was like, you know, grand slam home run. We had family investment in the company. We had almost done a full VC round, which we ended up just doing Angel and kind of friends and family rounds. And you know, the company for a while was teetering on bankruptcy at the time of this deal. The acquisition coming along. We had a million dollars banked. And no one does that anymore. But within like two years, we'd completed two or three years. We'd completely turn the company around. And we had within like three days we were covered, you know, the three days in, in do every month. We were covering the bottom line of the business. It was a very profitable business. So we were like, you know, thrilled about it, but at the same time we were running the business fairly conservatively. I would also suggest maybe on hindsight, probably not be that conservative with your capital. But, you know, it's easy to say now, you know, we're in like another very, well fairly optimistic time in the, at least in the valley. And, you know, it seemed very wise at the time. And we'd been through it. We'd seen a lot of companies go under and we didn't want to suffer that same fate. And if you've ever done layoffs, which no one even knows what that is, although, probably shouldn't mention that one. But anyway, so the, some people do now. But we didn't want to have to do that again. You never want to go through laying people off. Probably worse laying people off than being laid off. So trying to avoid that one. But, you know, so the deal was finally getting done. This was August, 04. We thought, oh sure, by Christmas time, this deal will be inked. This deal dragged out just like our old hosting deals until April of 2005. Meanwhile, I was getting married April 16th, right? And so, you know, part of the deal was we were going to, and we weren't allowed to tell anyone. The deal, part of the deal with Google was, if the deal gets out that we're trying to acquire you, if people know about it, we're going to walk. About 10 days before the deal was inked, or supposed to be inked. John Batel calls me on my cell phone and sends me an email. I happened to be in the shower, fortunately. And so I was listening to the voicemail and checking my email before I was going to work. And at the same time, hearing and seeing, hey, we understand you're getting acquired by Google. I'm going to write about it today, wondering if you wanted to comment. So, I was like, this is not good. So I called up some people at Google that we've been working with. The deal is going to leak. So it's kind of due or die time. They circled up. Several people said it's die time. Don't do the deal. Fortunately, guys like Wesley prevailed and got the deal done. And the deal actually closed on April 20th of 2005. April 16th is when I told you I get back to this. I was getting married. And so that's why I was at my wedding four days before inking the thing. The interesting thing about it though is that four days before that was the first time we could tell anyone. By the way, we're going to be acquired by Google. It's going to be a fun wedding. I'm going on my honeymoon. And as soon as I get back, I'm out of here, moving to San Francisco. Oh, by the way, it's so is the entire company. So that was a surprise to many people. But I think some people were suspicious because we did register for craft that we already had. And so people were wondering like, what are you getting another toaster? You have a toaster. And then they realized, oh, I see. They're moving to San Francisco. Our plan was to keep our heads in San Diego, which we ended up doing. But we moved everything out of there. But we did end up getting a lot of double stuff because of that. So anyway, and then we moved up to Google, which was, you know, it's been an incredible journey. It's been an awesome thing. This is a lot of the team. Some people aren't here. I'm not in the picture. Does anyone know? Can anyone say why I'm not in the photo? I knew some people were going to guess that. Who else? Someone said it? No, that was a year after. That's right. I was on my honeymoon. You went a prize. I'll show you in a minute. Waves garter. No, not my Waves garter. And so there we are. And so then a year later, I'm doing this. And the reason I wanted to show this photo again of surfing in Indonesia and being on this boat is that this, someone asked me one of our sales guys once said, you know, so what makes Brett Crasby tick? What motivates you to go and like do all this stuff? As I can only say, I always get out of that. But all I answer it nonetheless. You know, I want to build this company and then go surf the world, right? Get rich and surf the world. It was kind of my, I don't know, youthful answer, I guess. And he said, I said, how about you Ben? You know, and he said, oh, I want to, you know, I'm just doing this for my daughters. I was like, damn, I'm shallow. But, you know, of course it did turn out whatever I was getting married. So I wasn't able to go surf the world for good, but for a little while anyway. And the reason I pointed out also is to say that, look, it's like, it doesn't matter what your motivation is. It's good to have something that you're trying to get done, right? You want to have a goal in mind when you're doing this stuff because you're going to miss, you know, you guys are presumably in this because you want to go become entrepreneurs, right? You want to go out there and build a company and get bought by Google or whomever or just build it up and be the next Google. Sorry, that's probably exactly why you're here. And, you know, buy Google or something. So that would be great. Hopefully I can work for you then, too. But this was my goal, you know, and this is something that, of course as soon as you achieve your goal, things change. And life throws you curve balls and you end up doing different things. And now I'm expecting a daughter of my own this coming April. Actually, right around the time when the deal went through, everything happens right there in April and in a while. But, yeah, so it's interesting to see how this whole thing comes full circle. Now that we're at Google, this is one of the graphs that someone had what I'm showing here for people on the audio side of things is that, let's see, who did this? Someone, a Jupyter Research Analyst showed this at SCS Chicago 2004. This is a search engine strategy show. It's a kind of regional conference thing or not regional. It's all over the place now, but about search engines, obviously. And what they were showing is like, as you, this is a spend on search engine marketing and this is sophistication over time. You go from being unsfiscated as sophisticated right after you adopt analytics and you're spend on. When to adopt analytics, you're spend on the search engines on search engine marketing goes up significantly. There's an S curve. This was the theoretical model of what would happen if people just got analytics. And so we said, when we got to Google, we said, well, maybe we should test this theory. If we push it out there for free and a lot more people adopt analytics than were before, maybe it'll actually impact revenue a little bit. Turns out it was true. It worked. It's working extremely well. We give it away for free. It's something that's very beneficial to everyone. And the benefit that Google gets out of it aside from doing good things. So the non altruistic benefit is that search spend does increase if people use analytics. The altruistic benefit is actually really good for the entire ecosystem, right? Because if you're a site owner and you can understand what people are doing in your site, you're going to say, wow, okay, these ads aren't working. These ones are. And these ones work really well. People are falling off of my site here. Let me improve that. You can optimize that entire process. You're going to get a much happier, happier visitor. And they're going to turn into a customer. So that's your reward as a site owner. Google's reward, of course, is that people end up spending more. Plus you get happier people happier and users because they come and do a search. They find something. You know, they click on an ad and the ad ad is exactly what they were looking for and then the buying. So the whole ecosystem is improved by this. And I think pretty drastically actually. So. So here we are at Google. This is what it looks like. Life of Google is good. You guys probably know everyone knows about the food. I'm going to talk about that. I mean, you guys all follow Google. Do you? I'm a figure of being a Stanford. It's got to be like the thing. Right. I mean, I'm not saying that because I'm a Google person. I'm just saying, you know, you guys are Stanford people. So I gotta assume that's the. Anyway, maybe I'm wrong. Okay. So. The food's good. Parties are good. They take us on ski trips. This is me. Nice. And I want to do. I'm actually kind of at a breaking point. But I have a few lessons learned. I'll walk through, but I wanted to show you guys something I think is kind of cool. There's something at earth and we never actually used. But a friend of ours did this animation for us. And so I want to use it now. We don't have the rights of that song, which is why we never use it. Pretty sweet though. That was Jim Bradbury. He's off. He built a separate company after this. Sold it. He's doing great. But he did that for us the long time ago. Not that it was cool. Okay. So I can do questions now. Or look at that right on the half hour. Pretty good. Or I can go into my lessons learned. Maybe I'll, I don't know what you guys want to do. Anyone have questions immediately or should I do lessons learned? Lessons learned then. By the way, while I'm doing this part, feel free to throw something out there. I'm like interrupt driven. I always interrupt. So feel free to do it to me. So one of my lessons learned was I thought this might be useful to you guys is why I'm doing the lessons learned. It's not you guys all wanted to start companies right. That's why we're here. Go big. You know, Urchin wasn't that big, but it was reasonable. And now we've done even bigger with Google Analytics and we we did okay. And I would say from a business model standpoint, go big. And I also have acquisition that's a note to myself to talk about that for the second point. Business models. You know, we could have done the other direction where instead of trying to scale something to a lot of sites. We could have focused on individual sites and sold the product for like a hundred thousand dollars per installation. And there are certainly companies that do that in our space and the web analytics space. And they do very, very well. So that's definitely way to go. But a company company like that it's unlikely would be acquired by Google. We started a company before Google ever existed. So it's not as though we created this model to get acquired by Google right with this kind of incredible foresight. Turns out we just thought it was a good way to go. And we had this competitive advantage with the speed of the technology, right. So that's the reason we did this. But it actually tended it once Google did come along. It worked extremely well to kind of bolt on to their other offerings. We didn't have to retool Google's models or own models too much when we rolled out for free because we'd worked on making the product, you know, available in multiple languages and then also as easy to use as possible. That's one of the things we really tried to do. The other thing from an acquisition standpoint when we were looking at our potential suitors or acquires. It was Google. There was a company called website story that was very interested in us and there was a handful of others. RCEO at the time who was Paul, they get the red-haired kid in the back that I was showing earlier. He didn't even want to talk to Google. He wouldn't even respond to their emails because he's like, there's no way that deals are going to happen. Let's focus on this other one over here. Scott and Jack and I got Paul on the room and we said, Paul, listen. I understand where we're coming from and we kind of got burned on that funding round and there's some other things that make us want to focus on the conservative thing. But the Google deal, we had, you know, that's the deal we're going to do. And we're going to chase that one down until it's dead before we focus on these other ones. And Paul kind of said, okay, and he saw the light and saw that we were very serious about that. And he relented and said, okay, great. So then we did focus on Google and sure enough, it worked out. But sometimes going, good. Guess you in trouble. As I mentioned about our Japanese office, we thought, let's do it. We had to cut that and that was unfortunate. But nevertheless, I think it's better to try and go bigger than not to. That said, also keep it legal. Back in the, in a bubble days, and we'd meet with these big telcos and stuff. I don't really understand what they were asking about at the time. I was kind of naive, I have to say. And they would get us in the room and say, you know, I think we're going to do this deal. It sounds good. Aren't there services you need to buy from us? Like, don't you need to buy some hosting and some servers and stuff like that? Well, like, no, it doesn't, not only we need any. Thanks, though. And maybe there's something. And, you know, after all these scandals came out about what was happening, there was all this vendor financing, right? Where they would buy our products for like, you know, I'll just make up a number but say like 21 million. And really the deal would have been a million dollar deal. And then they say, but you buy 20 million dollars with its servers from us and hosting space to host all your applications within our data center. We're very fortunate we didn't take those sorts of deals. How do we not been naive enough to not, you know, see what was going on or too naive to see what was going on. We may very well been tempted. I hope we would not have taken those deals. But, you know, the benefit of doing those things is it looks like, you know, then you go out for funding and all these public markets. And you look like you have a balance sheet doing, you know, $500 million a year or something. Well, when these guys all went belly up, you know, you can imagine what would happen. There are collections departments would say, like, give us that 21 million and we'd say, well, you give us that 20 so we can pay you the, you know, or whatever they'd ask for the 20. We say, give us the 21 so we can give you the 20 and they're like, oh, we don't have that money. We're in bankruptcy, but go ahead and pay us. And that definitely would have put us out of business. So I definitely recommend not doing that. The other one is to build a good team. I already mentioned some of the folks we're working with really very smart people. Jack's a great negotiator. Scott's got a great head for business. Paul. Very technically savvy. We had a member on our team when we were doing the cable wireless deal. Again, one of our first really big deals we thought at the time. Everything was down to the final last minute and they said, oh, by the way, we need a Windows version of your product for this deal to work. So we don't have a Windows version of the product. So a unique space stuff. All right. Well, if you wanted to get this deal done, we need a Windows base. So we came back and told the engineers, hey, we need a Windows version. Our lead engineer says, that's impossible. We said, well, we have a million dollar check waiting on the other end of this. Not for you for the company. I don't know if we even mentioned that last part because what happened was that was a Friday afternoon. We got back in my name warning. He had the Windows version of the product done. Very solid engineer. Maybe that's when we broke it to him that the million wasn't for him. Yeah, he's still with us at Google. His name's Nathan. Great engineer. Great guy. A legend in our group for doing this. The other one as I mentioned, you know, get some good graphics guys and good copywriters. I think it helps a lot. It really helps you build your brand. It gives you that professional edge. You don't have to do it if you're like an edgy startup coming out. But as your company matures a little bit, you know, it's very handy to have. And, you know, we had that sort of thing was our login pages. This is like our trade show booth here. And they're all kinds of other things. I'll show you in a second. Okay. Another lesson learned. Act big, but stay humble. So here's a photo of me acting big and our little teeny booth. Often the corner at some trade show. Everyone else, you know, they ship their booth. Some truck pulls up some guys in the union get out and set up their booth. We carried it on the plane. We're like, we're the guy setting it up and tearing it down. And, you know, the three of us are like sharing a room at the Ramada or something like that. But meanwhile, we're like at these shows and we have to have this big presence and act like we're the biggest company in the place. And I think that's part of it is to try and look professional at least and put on that professional persona. Get out there and do the speaking gigs in the space you're in. It's very important for us. We wouldn't if we weren't at the SES San Jose show. I think that was about the extent of the shopping Google was doing when they were looking in the space. Who's at the show? Let's go look around. We can drive down the street and see who it is. Great. That day we were meeting with them and from then we were doing a deal. So, you know, how do we not been at the show? Who knows. Another lesson learned is to try new business models. Here's a picture of our, this is when we first did a deal with net taxi for what a urchin look like. And you can see at the top, usually this would all be blue by the way, all the yellow space. But at the top, we had this banner ad. And that was our first business model was to do and ad supported Web Analytics product. And interestingly enough, lots of them are starting up right now. All ad supported. Not necessarily everyone that's starting up, but there's several that are ad supported starting now. Which I find, I don't know, I guess it's, I don't know, maybe it's ironic. I don't know what it is exactly, but it's interesting nonetheless. The other thing actually that I should point out with this thing is that, you know, try and stay creative. This thing here, we would do an urchin of the day. Well, before Google started playing with their logo on their homepage, we were, we were doing it up here. And you could do an urchin of the day and have that change. And I'll show you an example of that in a minute. But back on the business model points and staying, you know, switching it around and stuff like that. This was a business model actually worked very, very well for us. We had tried to sell, we tried the ad supported, we tried to selling the software outright. But what we realized that there were all these different kind of installations that people could do. And we didn't want to limit people that had just like a site, you know, small server with a site they wanted to put it on. We wanted to make it inexpensive for them. But then, you know, when some big company would come to us, they were like, what do you mean it's 895 bucks? I want the robust version. So it's okay. Well, you can buy this campaign track module for another 4,000. And then e-commerce module on that and then load balancing. So for every server log that you pipe in, it's another 695 bucks. And then if you want an additional 100 sites, that's another 695 bucks. We came up with this whole model for scaling out pricing, depending. And it made the software extremely flexible and scalable for all these different environments. Without leaving a ton of money on the table, but we could also scale it to the small guys as well. And I think that that really helped as well as the simplification of our hosting deals. So here's one of the versions of the days, by the way. Celebrate the crazy moments. This is another lesson learned. And I'd say this is one of those things where we were just laughing. You know, Jack was so sad and he was crying so frustrated, trying to get this deal done. And he probably won't like the fact that I keep saying that he was crying. But I mean, he cried like one sort of frustration. It's not as though he was. He wasn't. Yeah. He's not the most emotional guy usually, but this was like, this is a tough deal. There are a lot of crazy moments that I could go into, but I should wrap up here. And the other lesson learned is don't give up, right? Plenty of chances for us to give up. And I'm personally happy we didn't. Tom's happy we didn't. There's a lot there. Another one is be flexible. There's a the emith. Has anyone ever read that book? So I forget the author's name. Great author. Read him a long time ago. I still see his work out there. He says work on your business, not in your business. One of the key things to being an entrepreneur is, I mean, you have to do the job in your business, right? Like I've done just about every role in the business other than, you know, coding, but I did used to build websites and stuff like that early on. But at the same time that you're working in your business, the reason I did so many things is that as soon as you understand one job, you need to hire someone else to do it and move on. So you can be focusing on the systems in your business and make sure everything's working. The sales are working. The support system is working. The business development opportunities and the licensing and all the little aspects that need to be thought through. A lot of people think they're very product focused. It's just about the product. It's the wrong way to approach business and you need to be thinking about all, you know, scale. And as soon as you understand something, according to the guy who wrote that book, move on and let the other guy do that job so you can manage him because you know how to do his job now. The other one is use what you've got, right? So what we had at the time at Urchin were strangely we had all these musicians using our software. So we got the idea of like, you know, Urchin rocks. It's a great product. And a lot of people would say that. Yeah, it's a great product. Rocks, you know, whatever. It was a popular thing to say that, I don't know. But, you know, Faith Hill was using it. So we got, you know, I think these were mockups that I'm showing you now and it would say things like Urchin rocks as used in Faith Hill.com. And we had Faith Hill and Tim McGraw and we had like all these country singers for some reason, I don't know why. But also Queen's Reich, don't ask. We had the offspring and you know, Gwen Stefani and all these people. So we had all them endorsing the product on our website. That's what we used what we had to work with. And that was kind of like, you know, kind of early 2000s and then some of our designers said, hey, why don't we drill into this underwater theme a little bit more. And so we did and we added underwater stuff to everything. And so Dolphins became part of our thing and you know, these are some different versions of our website. Want to show this one, of course, because the scar right over here. Yeah, it was a big, big customer. SC right on top. A lot of different variations of Crimson and Cardinal and all those reds. It's true. Yeah, we're very proud of that. A lot of great institutions were using Urchin. Still many of them still do. And as you've already seen, there's no end to the underwater theme. There's a key lesson learned. If you're going to go with a theme, pick something that you have a lot of, you know, runway on. Show you what I mean. Some of these are kind of cool. This one I like the suck and ship here, the dot com days are over. These days is all about conversions. This is a bad pun, but cool photo nonetheless. It may be a beautiful site, but when you go near it, there's a jellyfish on there for people on audio. I like this one a lot. Essential for the life of your business, web analytics and there's bubbles going up. And then there's sun rays coming through the water. To me, it looks like an upside down urchin too. I think we kind of did that intentionally. Spikes. Very, very subliminal. I think it was bottom some stock photography. This one. This was kind of a strange one because turtles are slow, right? And we're boasting about our speed. But we thought it was kind of like in your element, you can be fast. Like this turtle in the water. Like he looks like he's kind of cruising, right? So I don't know. Not sure it worked, but I thought this was kind of cool. But if you've ever tried to keep up with a sea turtle underwater. That's right. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, in your element. It's good. So. This one with a, you know, what separates you from your competitors? We got this little boy over here with it looking into the shark tanks. And there's lots of others. And so that's pretty much it for my visuals. You know, I have to say that doing this, I had a great time because I went through all these old, these old images. And I was doing the max got this, you know, leverage got this great feature where it's like all photos that have ever been on your computer. You can browse through. And I remember across stuff, I had no idea it was still in there. A lot of stuff. It was like, it was hard for me to get these without writing on them because I would pull them, you know, take a screenshot of our website and pull into Photoshop and like write notes on it. Like let's fix this. Well, let's change this around whatever and send them to our designer. And, you know, I was like, wow, what a pain. I was back then to work with, but it worked out, I guess. So, um, any questions? Oh, yes. In the back. So I know Google may be hurt some software free. Yes, after acquired it. I love free to talk about what that meant for your existing customers, what that meant for employees and sort of the overall vision to build a profitable economic business. Given the fact they made the product free right after the body. Yeah, well, I was trying to touch on it before, but let me actually clarify something. The question was for the people who aren't mic'd is that after Google made Google Analytics free, what is the business model behind it? And the question actually was making urgent free. The truth is we made urgent on demand free, but the software version actually is about is just coming out in beta. It's actually available again as a download, you know, installable beta. And that is going to be paid product. So just to be clear about clear about that. But we don't anticipate a huge amount of adoption there. Maybe there will be a huge amount of adoption. That's just to we have so much demand still from the original origin customers. A lot of these guys who are still using it. These guys all want us to, sorry, I'll address this side too. They all want us to come out with this version. So we are coming out with that again and many like urgent enthusiasts are very happy about it. But as far as the the cracks of the question, why did Google make Google Analytics free? Why not make it a paid model? And the simple answer is that, you know, anything we could have charged for the product, Google has the opportunity to make a lot more money. If a lot of people use it to improve the way they're spending their ads. So that's kind of like again the non altruistic reason why Google did there's a very clear incentive. It'd be better for us at scale. We can get a ton of advertisers using this or even non advertisers and then get them advertising because you can show them how well the whole ad system works or people coming from search into your website. And then you can make improvements. It just made a lot of sense. And if everyone spends a little bit more on search, it justifies the whole thing many times over. And then so the altruistic reason, as I said, it really helps the entire ecosystem. And we really believe it does. And you know, you talk to people all the time. I see a matrix and I say, my site's gotten so much better. It really helps me do all these things. And so I personally think it was one of the smartest things we did with acquisition. And that's something that we debated for a long time. Yeah. How did your background and political science and international relations help you to enterprise? The question is, how does my background and my major is international relations and political science double major, by the way, but a lot of crossover. I was able to sneak in the double major there. Well, we did business internationally in Japan. If I can really stretch for that one. But no, I think more than anything, you know, the answer is it didn't. The simple answer is it had no relevance. But what it did do, I think, is, you know, just going to college in general, obviously, teaches you how to think. And by the time I got out of college, I was definitely on my way to thinking these things through. All my friends, by the way, or most of my friends, aside from Jack and Scott and Paul, everyone was saying, hey, let's, you know, what company are you going to go join when you get out at sea? You know, I'm like, I don't know. I never thought about it. That was not really an interest to me. I didn't really think that way. I said, what do these guys have that we don't that, you know, we're smart people. How can we can't go start a company and do what they're doing? That was kind of my, you know, again, my naive attitude toward the whole thing. I know how difficult it is. But I still think, you know, I think you guys should have the same attitude. I'm not saying go don't, you know, don't go work for Google. That's a great place to work to. I don't think I've right would have gotten in sort of college into Google. So I didn't exist when I graduated. So, but in any case, yeah, nothing to do with that. Other questions? So, you had the links to the entertainment business and music in particular. Did going to SC or being from Southern California help you at all to build relationships with any of the people and the enemy? That's a great question. Did my background at SC and, you know, kind of like Stint and doing things in LA help help us at Urchin? And the answer is just barely. One of the guys who helped fund our company was a fraternity brother at SC. He started something called Ridler or something like that that was bought by 24 or 7 media. And so then he created a thing called Green Thumb Ventures and he helped us out along the way. And then the other way is that my girlfriend at the time, now my wife, was at Rubenpust Air Interactive and she made the initial introductions there to get us to work on a Honda account. And then, and they were outsourcing some like, you know, heavy Java stuff to us and very heavy programming early early on. But our experience with them give us the confidence to say, hey, we really have something here. Let's go sell off the rest of the company and focus on this. But in general, not with the entertainment industry or otherwise, actually want to scots old friends and a one time employee help make some of those relationships. What was the cultural shift from going kind of doing my own thing? Well, it was it was a crazy time. So then California to Silicon Valley, you think? Yeah, no, definitely. And I have to say, like if I was going to start another company, which, you know, is definitely a possibility. I would definitely do it here. If it had anything to do with technology. If it's like a hard goods thing, whatever I've got some other kind of strange concepts, they'll probably never happen. But if I do those, fine, I'll do them in San Diego or someone else or somewhere else, maybe. But if I'm doing, you know, if you're in the technology space, this is definitely the place to be. I think our entire business probably we could have compressed the time from start to acquisition by about, you know, cut it in half. Had we done it here? So you guys are in the right place if you're planning on going into the tech space. Sorry, what was the other part of the question? From your employees, how did the culture integrate with your work? So most of the people have done very well. Some people have moved on and are doing other things. Culturally, it was. Whiplash, we. And pretty painful. I think the reason it was so painful though is not just the culture change. It was because part of our deal we had. We were dealing with Google's attorneys was not a great time, I have to say. And Google, I think we've gotten a lot better at Google at doing acquisitions. We were like, I don't know, very early acquisition for Google. And they're willing to pay a heck of a lot more too, which is. But in any case. First of all, dealing with it, it dragged out for a long time before we got the deal done. And then once we got to Google, they were like, okay, we're going to pay you. Within your company's worth X, we're going to pay you half of that in cash. They wanted to do no cash. We're like, no way. What do you think we're born yesterday? Of course, we turned out to be the idiots. But not my first time. And so, but then they said, and then if you hit these other milestones within Google, we'll pay the rest of it the second half of the deal. And that was like stock that like basically you get it, but it doesn't actually you don't actually get it until later. We were like, the stock's not going to go up from here. This is ridiculous. And it was about a year after a little less than a year after the IPO. Fortunately, we were wrong again. And so, we got to Google and we couldn't play volleyball and enjoy the pools and go to the lounges and things like that and play the video games. We had basically about a year to meet these milestones. They were very serious. And some of them fairly painful milestones. Fortunately, we hit them. And that was part of the deal. But for about a year, I knew it was going to be like as great as the company is to work at, you know, I knew it was going to be brutal. And it was. It was. But, you know, in sense, then the good thing is that it kind of establishes having a very solid work ethic. So all the people that kind of did that worked extremely hard for the first year. And then we continue to work hard and excel. Yes. I'm wondering, you mentioned that musicians somehow. I don't know why all these musicians were using urgent. I have no idea. It was just one of those things. My point was when I was trying to show the slide is not, you know, find a niche that's great. It's work with what you have. And we had all these musicians using it. I don't know why. It was just one of those things. It probably is just that we had all these other, you know, we had a ton of businesses. And we just happened to notice all these musicians using it. And so we said, hey, let's. Let's point this fact out. We did this urgent rock campaign as I pointed out. We also made these guitar picks with urchins on them. Very cool. Yes. Yeah. You just mentioned that. So also. I was just wondering they have their own two. Because they made the model. Why was website story thing about acquiring us? They had their own tool there in the space. Interestingly enough, I mean, I don't know why this is, but like. Nine tents of all web analytics companies have come out of San Diego or for some strange reason. There's web trends out of. Out of Portland and you know, I'm going to show out of Orm, Utah. Now there are a few others out of other places, but it was strange for some reason everyone was in San Diego. That would have been a very easy acquisition. We could have instead of going here for work, just, you know, cross town. Their interest was that we had a massive customer base. Their tool was. It's more targeted for the high end of the market and they wanted a mid tier solution. Not necessarily quality wise, but price wise and what the market was expecting. So they were very interested in doing that. Interestingly enough, you look at their acquisition history. They ended up going the opposite direction in an acquiring visual sciences, which was kind of like one of the highest and tools in the market or at least. According to the price range, most expensive tools. I think part of the reason that happened and they went that direction is that Google analytics made it a little more difficult to come down market than it would have been otherwise. Say answer that. Oh, yeah, it's a good point. So the website story just got acquired by on it here. Yes. And so the web analytics industry is definitely consolidating. And that may have worked out fine for us too, because then you get the double acquisition situation. But at this point, I don't see anyone buying Google, but who knows. Are we done? I think we're out of time. We're starting off by talking about starting this business with your brother and your friends. And do you have any tips for people you said, you know, look around. You might be seeing people here on sort of managing personal and business relationships. It's a good question. Sorry. Before we end the question, I'll answer it quickly is managing your business and personal relationships in a place like Stanford where you may end up doing business with people later. I mean, honestly, I would say that the people that tried to have this kind of business persona with me in college, I never really wanted much to do it because they thought like, hey, we'll do business and we'll keep it kind of on the up and up. I wanted to do business with the people that were very, very real to me and that were interesting to me and I could connect with on a human level. And so, at least in the people that I would want to be in the core meeting with, making really crucial decisions, I wouldn't want that kind of business front between us. So, I would say my advice would be be yourself, have fun. Do what you're supposed to do while you're at Stanford. Obviously, get your education, but also have a great time and let people know who you are and what you're about in your core beliefs. That's what I would say. Scott has a question. I was going to say the number one thing about that that I learned was that if you have a dispute with somebody you work with that you started a company and especially a friend, walk into their office and settle it, don't do it over email. That's great advice. Never do dispute resolution over email. That's still great advice, even especially at a company that says Google, you know, you get no, like, who does this person think they are? And then it turns out they were just, they meant nothing, no harm at all. So, anyway. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate it. Oh, thank you.
