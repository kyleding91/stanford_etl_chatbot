 Mark, I think there were a lot of people internationally in the audience who may not know what the Facebook is. And why don't you just start tell us a little bit about how this all started and what's it been like? What's the Facebook? Sure. Okay, this makes more. Alright, so I did two years at Harvard. During my sophomore year I decided that Harvard needed a Facebook, it didn't have one, so I made it. That's basically how it got started. I think that after about a couple of weeks of it being out, I was hoping that maybe like a couple of people would sign up for something. But a lot of people signed up and then we started getting requests from people at other schools to watch Facebook's at their schools. So I just kind of thought about what the best way to do that would be and came up with the model that we have now. And I've spent most of the last two years just spreading that across the country and to a bunch of schools internationally. So that's kind of where we are now with all those users and a lot of college students across the nation. And what is it for a lot of people in the audience who are from Europe, Asia, tell us a little bit about what the Facebook actually is and why is it growing the way it is? It's essentially an online directory for students where people can go and look up other people and find relevant information about them, everything from what they're interested in to their contact information, what courses they're taking, who they know, who their friends are, what people say about them, what photos they have now. Yeah, I guess it's mostly utility for people to figure out just what's going on in their lives and in their friends lives for people who they care about. So a show of hands in the audience, how many people know of the Facebook or knew of the Facebook prior to this discussion? How many are users of the Facebook? You can admit that. How many use the Facebook at least once a day? All right. Well, one of the most staggering statistics, and Mark, the interesting to just get a sense of why this is, is the daily repeat usage. And it does make one wonder what is happening on college campuses today. The statistics are simply staggering that of the 5 million users, and it's continuously increasing, we just had our 5 million user party, there were 5.5 billion page views in the month of September for the Facebook. This is an 18-month-old company. And Mark, you might talk about the usage statistics because it's really about everything we look for when we're starting companies, we're trying to get involved with entrepreneurs who start companies, not in terms of the initial reach, but that daily usage, and that continuous usage, and that we've used phrases and adventure business, if we're a professor, Tom Biers talk about viral effects and network effects. But this is something that embodies that, and Mark, you might talk about the statistics and what matters to you, most relative to the so-called financial statistics. So, the three things that I measure the most are, as James said, how often people come back to the site, I guess, three things are daily, weekly, and monthly. And I guess we've always just kind of focused on keeping those numbers high. The daily number is around 70% for all students, and weekly is about 85, and monthly is around 90% to 3% or so. So, I think that that's really important for us because we're not trying to create something that people use for, like, a specific purpose. This is a utility that people can use to just find relevant information socially to them. And I tried to make something like that. People could kind of look up extensively, just, random things about random people, and try to get everyone to be on there, and a lot of relevant information to me on there. The fact that people can come back every day for different purposes, and keep a browser open on their computer, maybe, and just go and type in someone's name and find information about them, is the type of use that we aimed to tune this application towards, and kind of help us for it. So, I pulled a number of people prior to the meeting on what would be most interesting to discuss, and this is like a board meeting, by the way. People ask what are Facebook board meetings like, how might they compare to what a Walmart board meeting might be? They're a little bit different that I can promise you. And one of the most interesting parts, obviously, about partnership that I think of the Facebook is what does product development really need? And Mark, you might talk about the number of questions I had yesterday and then earlier today. What is product development at the Facebook? How does that evolve as you evolve the company? How do you think about product development and the product experience going forward? So, there are two parts of this. One is kind of optimizing and making better what we already have, and the one is adding new things. Like, the recent photo application, which we just added. So, I guess I'll talk about that and kind of like what my thoughts were going into that. We just launched an application for those who don't know that allows students or members of Facebook to upload an unlimited number of photos to the site and then browse them by identifying who are in the pictures. So, you can go to a friend or anyone's profile and see not only pictures that they have taken, but other pictures that people have taken of them. And I guess the thought process behind this was, how do we fill out the network in order to make something that is most universally useful? So, I guess in doing so we realized that maybe 10% of people would upload photos. And I guess we've had this out for about a week now and at the schools that we were all allowed to have were currently testing it. So, we were only at like 30% of the schools so far. I think about 10 or 15% of the people who have the speed you're in upload photos, but more than 40% of the people on the network have photos taken of them. So, when we're designing stuff, we look not necessarily just about what any given user is going through experience, but what's kind of better for the whole community and the whole product. And I mean it's kind of like a lot of these trade-offs are going on all over the place in the product. Probably the most that you see every day is that you can't see the profiles of people at other schools. And that's a really major trade-off in the application. For those of you who are familiar with this, we split up the user base by what school they go to. And we make it so that people at a given school can only see the profiles and contact information of people at their school. And the reason for this was mostly to, because we realized that the people around you at your schoolers, the people who you're going to want to look at mostly anyway. And if we made this base too broad and let anyone see your information, then they'll probably be fine and you look up some people, but you'll probably not wouldn't put up your cell phone. And more than a third of people on Facebook have their cell phone up there, and that's something that's useful for the application. So in designing it, this was a trade-off that we made. I kind of thought about this for all of us. What would be more useful would be better for people to be able to see everyone. And maybe not feel like this is a secure environment, which they can share their interest in, what they thought, what they cared about. Or would be better that more information and more expression was available, but to a smaller audience, which is probably the relevant audience for any person. So there's a lot of decisions like that that are getting made, and I would have never got level. So I mean, we try to be as academic about it as possible in trying to think rigorously through the different results that we'll get if we do our different directions. But I mean, a lot of it is just like, you define your objectives, what you're going to core, in this case to optimize for the best of the whole community and the whole user base. Over the long term, and that's important to you a lot of over short term. And then just kind of operate and do what you think will be best along that line. So when I first met Mark, and we started talking, it was one of the first times certainly in my venture capital career when we went out to dinner, I was not allowed to buy your glass of wine or glass of beer. The sprite was pretty good. I think so. Exactly. It was actually the village pub where Tom Buyers and others have spent considerable time, and they can tell you about that. Adam Ray. But Mark's team is younger than most entrepreneurial teams, and Mark has turned 21 by the way, I was over a couple of months ago. So now we can have wine and beer at dinner when we're brainstorming. But you might talk about how it is to work. You had a founding team, many of which were college friends. The team is evolved. You've quadrupled in size or some astronomical number in the last several months. And talk a little bit about what it's been like for you as a leader in the CEO and founder, and very much the long term CEO I will add. What is it like to build the team? How has it changed? How is your role changing? Maybe some of the most interesting dynamics along the way from that perspective. So when I started off, I was programming the site, and I wrote the first version. We haven't really had a second version, we're just constantly iterating on it. So I guess for most of last school year, I just worked on scaling and trying to make it keep up with the increasing load and trying to make it so that we can expand more, start on more schools. And we're having a network infrastructure and all that stuff. But as that time was going along, we also kind of opportunistically hired people who we thought were really smart. And for most of last year, we were just a few guys working around my kitchen table, and that was pretty fun. But I guess around in February, we got into office, and then we kind of took all these people who we've been hiring and brought them into one space, which was interesting. Because then for the first time, I kind of looked up and was like, wow, I have a team of engineers here. And a lot of smart people who can start building a lot of stuff in a different way than it's currently being done. And right now, it was made my remade dust stem, and just kind of sitting there and working with Siri Lee on one project and then finishing it and then planning a admin during the next project, and with little help from the other people who are around. But trying to figure out how to manage the transition from doing that, especially when you're kind of one of the people who's programmed, just saying, okay, we have eight really talented people here. What's now the most efficient use of people's time? Like how can people maybe be working on stuff not Siri Lee, but I would say someone's working on launching a high school product over here. And someone else is working on photos and someone else is working on the thing that we're going to launch next week. What's the most efficient use of people? So that's kind of an interesting problem, and it's something that I don't really have a good insight on for you guys. Maybe I'll check that in a year. But I think that one thing that Jim was getting out was sort of the dynamics between people. And the dynamic of managing people and being CEO and a company is a lot different than being college roommates with someone. And when you go into something and your expectations are that, you know, this is going to be a site that maybe a few thousand people are on, and the guy drops out of school to come out to California to work with you. And it just kind of changes things up. I don't know. I think that it definitely, you kind of have to think at like a higher level about how the landscape is playing out. In terms of like, you need to not only have engineers who can directly work on the product that you're working on, but then you need to start having a finance department or something that I never thought that I would ever need. And I think that's a running website in order to power the infrastructure just having a 20 or 30 person engineering team. And then it's like, okay, so you have all these people, then like, how do you kind of watch what they're doing? And I'm not trying to control too much with their own. They're all really smart people, which is why we brought them. And we want to leverage the fact that they have a lot of really good ideas and can do a lot of the stuff themselves. But how do you make sure that it's conforming to standards, or that it's being done well enough, both from product perspective and engineering perspective? I think that there's so a lot more thought. Now, you recruited a lot of Stanford students and you recruited elsewhere. And you're still, it has me to emphasize you still actively recruiting Stanford students for those of you in the audience. What do you look for in terms of culture, the kinds of students who make it through the process, the kinds of graduates that make it through the process, the balance of experience and IQ? How do you think about building the team and evolving the team going forward? So I mean, I think that the two most important things that I look for are number one is just draw intelligence. Because then you can hire someone who's a software engineer and has been doing it for 10 years. And if they're doing it for 10 years, that's probably what they're doing for their life. And I mean, that's cool. But there's some things that that person can do. And they're definitely useful within an organization and can do a lot of stuff. But if you find someone who's who's raw intelligence exceeds theirs but has 10 years, lots of experience, then they can probably adapt and learn and wakewicker. And within a very short amount of time, be able to do a lot of things that that person may never be able to do. And so I think that that's the most important thing that I look for. And the second is just alignment with what we're trying to do. So I mean, people can be really smart or have skills that are directly applicable. But if they don't really believe in it, then they're not going to really work hard. And even if they're a smart guy who doesn't have the relevant experience, they're not going to care enough to develop the relevant experience in order to succeed. So I mean, I think that the best people who have hired so far have been people who didn't really have that much engineering experience. I mean, I hired a couple of electrical engineers that have Stanford to do programming stuff. And they had very little programming experience going in, but just really smart, really willing to go at it. And I mean, the guy who just wrote photos was one of those guys. And I mean, if you're willing to just go and do whatever it takes to get photos out, then you're probably more valuable than someone who's just a career software engineer. So those are the things that I'm looking for and why I would rather recruit people out of college. Now, I have to ask, it's a phrase I don't like, but it's a phrase that's applied to the Facebook all the time. It's social networking, a wall of friends, or whatever it might be. And I'm curious to hear how you think about social networking. Is it relevant as you think about the Facebook? And how do you define what Facebook really is? Yes, I don't really call it a social network. I know that. I know that. Nor do I, but a lot of people do. So I would prove it as an online directory. And I think that they're kind of different things. I mean, a social network is a community application. And this definitely is a social application. The use of this is definitely aided by the use of friends and people around you using it. But I really just think that it's a utility. And something that people use in their daily lives to look people up and find information about people. And in that way, it's not, I mean, maybe there's some form of networking going on, or whatever people would traditionally describe as social network as. But I think to me, if you're drawing a distinction between what we are in with social network is, I think that social networking is, it seems to me, not really a vertical application, but more horizontal in terms of that it's more of a tool set that you use. I mean, social networks help you wire up an application really quickly. I mean, friends there, my space, Facebook, all very different things. But I mean, you can apply the word social network to them because they have this model of having friends where you send invitations. And I think that they all kind of use it to achieve the same result, which is getting people to come to the site, getting people to keep using it for a certain function, which is that social function. But then they kind of parlay that into different uses. So, I mean, we have this directory utility. Friendster is a dating site. Facebook does not in any way aim to be a dating site, even though maybe some of that goes on. Just a bit. Just a little bit. And, you know, it's what my space is. But, um, so yeah, so I think that kind of saying that something is a social network or in the social networking space is saying that a company that has factories is in the assembly line space. So, why is it that the first generation of so-called social networks, friends, or in others, plateaued quite quickly and perhaps have declined. It games not over, but there was a generation of social networks that as companies that were very hot in Silicon Valley two years ago, and have not achieved a momentum that a my space or a Facebook has. What would be some of the reasons in your view? Well, I think that the thing that we focus on most is utility, and I said that a few times so far. But, I mean, I think that making the site useful and keeping the utility there is the thing that I focus on most. And, I mean, even in something like the photo application, we, that's an entertaining feature, but it's also really useful because you can see people in different contexts. You can see photos of people that, all their people are putting up for them. You can tell the context around them, and I guess like next week you will tell the context more. But, you know, like, I think that the utility is pretty important. I think that a lot of the reason why some of them have failed is because the horizontal social network piece works really well at growing stuff. And that provides a technical challenge to people who are creating these things as their networks and user base scale up really quickly to kind of keep up with that. Especially if you're using sort of friend graph type structure to compute anything. I know a lot of those algorithms don't scale nicely. And, and if you're not doing stuff well, then you can't really support millions of users. So, I mean, we've come through periods where we didn't have enough hardware and we weren't doing stuff as well as we could. And that, and then the site got a little slow. And I think that now we're maybe more in a stable position. My space is also at issues with their technical infrastructure. I think that was a big problem for a friendster. And why they, who are the first people in the space kind of. I left one more question and then I want to be sure to take questions from our from the audience. There was a large international group here and watching. And how do you think about the relevance of Facebook internationally as you think forward? I know there's an international piece of it today, but maybe project a couple years forward in the international aspect of Facebook. And how will it fit culturally whether it's Europe, Asia or other parts of the world? So, I mean, one of the things that I've been sort of hesitant about in terms of expanding outside the US, we have a bunch of colleges like Oxford and Cambridge, and a bunch of schools over there. I mean, there are large populations of colleges and countries like China, but I'm not quite sure whether the culture or universities there is similar enough such that the same application works. Localization is definitely necessary. I mean, they speak a different language, so we need to have the application in that language in order to have it be relevant. But for me, there's kind of a question of whether there's more there. I mean, this is not Microsoft Word, you know, where it's, I mean, I keep on going back to the fact that I think that it's a utility. And I think that it is a social utility. So, I mean, it's a different kind of utility than Word. And I think that it might be pretty relevant, but it requires some thought about what those specific cultures are, and maybe the density of students in those cultures or the amount of percent of the population that goes to university. I mean, these are all kind of factors that have played into whether or not someone like this would be relevant in those places. And I think that this time goes on will definitely invest, I guess, like the time and resources into doing that. I think that right now stuff like watching high school product was more efficient use of our time. It was very something that we can do really quickly. You know, the high school model was very similar to the college model that we had. And I mean, there's more high school students than college students and it just seemed like a very effective use of our time. And as time goes on and we're looking to expand further, it's something that we're going to look to do, although it's definitely outside of our core confidence. So we'll see. Hopefully we can do that. If there are questions and I see some hands coming up, why don't we start questions right over here in the blue shirt? Please use the mic and I'll repeat the question. And if the mic's not working, I'll do my best to repeat the question. Not being a user of Facebook, I'm curious and these are two related questions. What happens when you finish college and you're a longer student? Do you get dropped from the system? Is there some kind of alumni legacy thing that goes on or what have you specials since you're focusing on? A school wall, if you will, I'm not sure that alumni makes in a lot of sense, but I'm sure Mr. Breyer doesn't like to see a lot of customers leading your application as well. Secondly, what kind of immigration path do you have? You have a little bit of high schoolers going to colleges or students to get to courses? Many more high school students than there are college students in the community. Are you able to say all that information and will it all easily or is it just a nightmare and you keep it separate? If you share some information on that, I'm familiar with the program of your application. I'd like to know. I think that I'm going to approach this for more of a meta level. The most important thing that we should be doing is a business is prioritizing and figuring out what the right things are for us to be approaching now. We're doing what people are going to be doing eight months from now or six months from now or whatever that is that people are going to be graduating and moving off the network when that's something that we can solve in a couple of weeks by throwing some together. I don't have the solution yet and we'll definitely figure that out by then. I'm going to throw out the prioritizing and working on the stuff that's really important now is always the best use of our time. That said, we currently, last year we had a full year of college students who graduated. It was almost 800,000 people who left college. We've always been open to alums registering for the site and I think that recent alums definitely makes a lot of sense. If you're a senior and you're graduated, you still have plenty of friends in college. People like me in recent alums. For our loves, for our senior. You have to do it just don't show yourself. The end of last year, what I did to approach that problem, or type of problem was I created a geography based version so that people could not only be at a school, Stanford, and the senior profiles of the other people at Stanford, but also say I'm in San Francisco, I'm in New York. I've seen the people around them. That was fine for 800,000 people. This year we're going to start having a larger population because we're going to graduate a second year, which is going to be even larger because we're growing this year. We're definitely going to make something and I'm working on it now, but I'm not really sure what it's going to end up looking like. I assume that we're going to have a college part. I assume that we're going to have a college part. You might talk about how you launched high school, though, because there was a very defined set of interactions and thoughts around how you wanted to launch the high school. So I mean only about five percent of high schools have authentic in an email. So I'm .edu or .org. So that was one of the best things about the college side is you can bucket people pretty easily. I'm authenticate that and make sure that no one was on the Stanford Facebook. We didn't belong there. That doesn't really exist for a lot of high schools. Although it did exist for some. So we decided to do it in by only. But the problem with that is that you need to see it because if you don't have anyone in these high schools, then you can't have people invite people to them. So I guess what we did was we took the structure data that we had in the college side about where people went to high school. It took all the incoming freshmen, just sign up at five months before they get to college for some reason. And we were like, all right, go into my higher high school. That we seated that way. I mean, Sunday was the first day that the high school network served as larger than the college network served. So, sorry. Do you want to talk about how many users per day or per week you're adding or give a order of magnitude just to get sure? People to think about how quick the growth actually is. And it's over 20,000 a day. Quite a stout. 20,000 a day. And accelerating. Right here in red. How does Facebook make violence? That's a question. So, I mean, when you're running a site and you're four people around the kitchen table, you're operating expenses are relatively low. So, traditionally what we've done was we have to do. We have a very small sales force and we sell some ads. You might see them on the site. And we've just kept our operating expenses low so far. And by doing that, we've been able to stay cashflow positive for basically the entire existence of the company after we took some money from these guys. We decided that it was okay to go a few months and cashflow negative while very generally cashflow. Yeah. It was like $100,000 a month. Not really. So, and then, but now we're happy. And we do a lot of page views. I think that it's not something that you really think about because you probably just think about this as a Stanford site. But every day we do more than 200 million page views. I think recently we're up to 230 million by the end of, probably two weeks from now. So, we're going to pass Google and page views. And like, that's a lot. You don't really think about it. That kind of application, I was pretty surprised when I heard that. But when you have that many page views and that many people spending time on the site, you can monetize it pretty easily. I just find playing patterns on there. And like, the revenue that we're generating over a million dollars a month in revenue and look well more. And that weight of our expenses. And we're not even doing anything to bull you out. So, I mean, yeah. That's all right. Right here. This question is from our phone. Mr. Alvin skills required in college over a class that could be further processed. Who did this one? The question was the most important entrepreneurial skills required in college or elsewhere or the Facebook? Good question. So, I actually studied psychology at Harvard, not from your science, although a little bit of your science. I've been programming since I was like 10. And I think that it kind of reached a point where when it's my intuition, I wasn't really thinking that much about it consciously. So, that was pretty good. And then, when I started thinking about all the people I used in doing psychology and just being a university and directing with a lot of people, she kind of encouraged me that this would be something that was interesting. I knew how to do it, so I just did. I mean, it took me like a couple of weeks, or even less to throw together the site. And I remember that by the time I was done throwing together the site, I had no idea how successful I would understand. And I was actually thinking that after I could date or date nine, I had a different idea that I wanted to do, and I was going to scrap it. So, I'm happy that I didn't do that. But, I think that it's more like how you spend your time doing stuff, type of question, or type of answer, than like something that I learned specifically from college. I made a ton of random things when I was at Harvard, and most of them didn't know what ever saw. A lot of them were meant for other people to see, and there were things that I made for myself, because I thought that it would be cool. I used to make stuff like a natural language in your face to play my Ampete Grees, you know. The thing I made before this was a hot or not program out of everyone's ideas at Harvard that almost got me kicked out. But, I just spent a lot of time making random stuff. I think that definitely made it, so by the time I came to make this random project, I was pretty well tuned for it's making that. In terms of managing this whole process, nothing. I had no idea what I was going to do. I'll add a couple comments. Mark has a skill which, a number of skills, which one rarely sees in an entrepreneur no matter what the age is. He's a great listener, and you learn by listening. I'm still stunned to see how many entrepreneurs come to our offices in Paul Aldo, and it's all output. And there's no thoughtfulness. It's amazing that the very best entrepreneurs are very proactive. They're very courageous. They deal with tension. But they're great listeners, and then they translate that into interactive learning. And the organizations tend to be great listening organizations. And Mark is extraordinary that way, as are many of the best entrepreneurs or executives that we've met. There is also a constant creative tension around experimentation, and making sure everyone in the organization feels it's better to experiment, fail, and then move on and experiment again than to not do that. And in something like a consumer internet company, like Facebook, that constant real-time interaction and experimentation is something that the very best entrepreneurs do. They just, they have the passion. They have an innate feel for it, and it happens organizationally, and it happens from a leadership standpoint. That's something that can, to some extent, be taught. It can be honed. But those are some of the skills for a consumer internet company, and one that is growing this quickly, that is just essential. And it needs to be embodied in the entrepreneur. That's something that we see again and again, and it's remarkable how little common sense is often applied. If somebody just steps back and truly listens and watches the customers and then rapidly iterates, good things tend to happen. We'll go right here in the middle. Mark, from the very beginning, day one or maybe week one, was this a business idea with Target Mark getting revenue from tackle projections and revenue model? Or is this more of a cool programming thing that you might do for your friends? That's fun. No. It actually wasn't a business thing until like six months after we started it. I just like, so I programmed the original version and launched it in February or four. After a couple of weeks of being in Harvard, people started repressing at other schools. I was taking a free heavy course load that term, so I wasn't sure how I was going to do that, both technically and how I was going to have the time to do it. So one of my roommates was like, oh, help you. You can program. So he went home for the weekend, bought a book for Dummies, and then came back and was like, all right, I'm ready to come. Dude, the set's not ready for all. So we were working on it together for a while, and then we came out to Palo Alto for that summer where I kind of got stuck. But we came out here mostly because this was a place that a lot of startups had been in front of them, and it seemed like a pretty fun place to be in some place that it made sense for us to be at some point in our lives. And also because I had a couple of friends who were working at EA, and I was out there. And it was out here that I kind of learned a lot of the stuff and met a couple of people who got us started. Right here. My name is Mike, and I'm really glad to be here. Mark, I have a question about the utility aspect. You've mentioned that Facebook is utility, not a social networking software or anything like that. But when you talk about the utility, I'm curious about what you're actually having the people do, because they're browsing around, and it seems as if it's essentially a stocking tool. And so what are the sort of ethical implications when it comes to developing a tool where you're leading an up to the user future, not saying, you know, it's like the gunmaning package made the gun, you know, it's like it's pointed at people. But ultimately, when you have a tool like this, and it's venture funded and it's back, there are sort of ethical implications that possibly legal implications in the future. How can you both respond to how you're taking the approach to that? So I mean, we do a lot of stuff with the data that's collected, and a lot of that is aimed towards correctively defending the user base, and I'm making sure that we have analyzed a pattern which is like the typical user heartbeat, or like what their use looks like. And we can identify relatively quickly when someone doesn't match that and do whatever we need to do, probably within like, you know, like 20 pages or so. So yeah, so I mean, that's mostly what we do. We have like an automated system for identifying stuff like this, and then taking whatever action we need to. But I mean, in terms of the ethical implications of creating this, what I kind of saw is as enabling a, for your flow of information. You know what I mean? People are interested in this stuff. We're not asking anyone to put anything out there that they wouldn't be comfortable putting out there, and forcing anyone to publicize any information about themselves. We give people pretty good control over their privacy. I mean, you can make it said no one can see anything, or like no one can see your profile, unless they're your friend. And I think that we encourage people to use that stuff. I mean, we point people to it. We make people not use their school password when they register, in order, like, just because that's like the most secure way to do things. And I think that just by putting people in control of what they put out there, we are kind of putting in in their hands. But we're not necessarily putting in the hands of the person who will misuse it. We're putting in the hands of the person who could be potentially the victim of it ever came to that. But I mean, we're not really finding that much. Jim, could you respond to this as well? And also when it comes to minors now, in the case of high school students, how does this control filter down for those sort of reasons? I'll take on the privacy question and the ethics question and let Mark talk about high school. In many ways, I think, our challenge is from a business perspective and a usage standpoint would be similar to how eBay evolved. We certainly spend a lot of time thinking about what are the privacy issues. At the same time, we want to enable the user base to, when all is said and done, it's a validated user base. It's very different from 99% of the sites out there. And we feel that that's the true power of the experience. So we don't want to get in the way of that. There's no doubt, however, we think, meeting the long term about privacy issues, security issues, and perhaps the closest model out there, in my view, would be how eBay had to make some fundamental decisions along the way relative to the democratization, if you will, with their user base. You might talk about high school, because we've had long discussions about that. We thought part about that. Yeah, so in high school, we do kind of the same thing that we do in college, although we have scripts that just constantly crawl through the site and, you know, from using it, that some people have fake profiles. And as a human, you can tell that there are some things about that that are different and why they're fake, and it's just immediately obvious to you. And it's obvious because it doesn't fit a normal usage pattern. You know, either they don't put up a lot of information about themselves, but they're viewing a lot of profiles, or they have no friends, but are viewing a lot of profiles, or the classes that they're putting in are fake, or the information they're putting in is fake. Or their name is Keggy the Keg. You know, or, you know, and, you know, there's just a lot of signs, and like, you can just apply really simple pattern matching stuff to a lot of us to figure out who these things, like who these people are really quickly. And coming back to college, just one statistic, which is quite extraordinary. Mark, you might just mention to the audience how the predictive nature of some of the usage may work. In particular regarding relationships, it's a fascinating statistic, one of many. Yeah, so I mean, some of the things that we do, we actually compute how like a percentage of realness that a person is, and if they fall below a threshold, then they're gone. So I mean, like, so it's actually pretty funny, this song that my friends and I like to do, we just go through and like see how real certain people are, we know we're actually real people, we're not here in 75% real. But using the information that we have, we can predict a lot of stuff, both stuff, fine stuff that's interesting to you in terms of events that are going on with the network. One of the things that we originally thought would be cool was, you know, we have this photo thing, and we have some new stuff that's going to be coming out soon. Like, with all these users posting content, how do you filter it for people? You know, how do you know for them or help them filter through what's going to be most interesting to them? I mean, you can't just say like who your friends are and look at their photos, you know, because some people have 300 friends. Some people have 100 friends, but if you have 100 friends and they're all posting a lot of photo albums or updating their profiles a lot, or whatever people do, you know, then like, then that's just a lot of stuff to sort through. So, I mean, you kind of want to figure out the strength of a lot of those relationships and how, and what actually matters to each person on a more granular level. And one of the things that one of my friends and I were messing around with the other night was, seeing if we could use the information that we had to compute who we thought were going to be in relationships. So, we tested this about a week later, and we realized that we had, over a third chance of predicting whether two people were going to be in a relationship a week from now. So, we can use stuff like that to filter out bad weeds. Good, let's go to the back here. I think you started this because you got to do a harder and you received a need for this. Yeah. How many of you guys have aimed? Like, do you guys like checking away messages? I don't know. I just find information about people in aggregate interest. You know what I mean? One of the things that I wrote before this was something that just looked and kind of tracked what different people's away messages were at different times. That's kind of interesting. Not to publicize that information, but just sort of base of information. I kind of figured that everyone else around would be checking away messages, and would think that something like that would be cool. Maybe I'm not alone in thinking that it would be cool, but I could type into a box someone's name and get a bunch of information about that person, or be able to look up where they are now, or where they live, or what their phone number is. Who they know, or what people are saying about that and stuff. Yeah. One of the most interesting questions we continuously asked ourselves at Excel over the last year and nine months. Why didn't we see a Facebook earlier? It's a remarkable... I think it's a remarkable dynamic that March started this company in 2004. And that first generation, the first nine or ten years of the internet, did not have a Facebook-like company that was thinking through it in a simple way. Sometimes it's remarkable for all of us as we try to be very prepared, mind-oriented, very proactive around where are the most interesting opportunities. I think it's often these very simple but powerful ideas that really take off. And there are some other ideas like that where we step back and really try to understand as investors and hopefully partners with entrepreneurs. Where do we see the most compelling next generation ideas? And it's usually something that's very simple, that's embodied in the personality of an entrepreneur. Right here in the blue. And please just a mic, thank you. So there are a lot of social networks out there and a lot of them are built as silos. And I think that is the number one reason why they have plateaued over the last few years. Also, the Facebook is not an social network, it's a utility. And so have you actually thought about, instead of building all the applications on your platform, have you ever thought about opening up the Facebook over particular services or something, and have hundreds of people go build, hundreds of utility applications on the Facebook? I think this has a little side of the violence that's piled up by the Facebook or something. Yes, and then you guys have studied operating systems languages or a computer. Exactly. To resounding yes. Right behind this question. This is kind of an interesting question. I know that you can, and to say, step by step, you might not have to follow us, but it's about against strategy. And there's an old school company called Gareth's Publishing, kind of known to be alumni market. They pretty much put in all the alumni factories, at all universities around here. That seems to me to be the succession model from the Facebook. Have you thought about your own strategy and giving the fact that Gareth Publishing is pretty much an old-line company, pretty quickly, and their life will be not a very good succession target? Have you thought about, and Jim, you might be able to answer that question. How do you best monetize this as an energy strategy? I spend my time thinking about how to build this and not how to egg well. I think that what we're doing is more interesting than what anyone else is doing. And that is just a cool thing to be doing. And I mean, yeah, I don't sometimes think about that. I'm not sure. Sorry. And I actually don't either. I think it's... We're long-term oriented investors. I think what we are seeing is going to be a fascinating time in what the traditional media business might look like. I think we're all aware this is one of the few times where there has been strong resurgence in the overall advertising market. But many, if not most of the traditional media companies, have not seen a rebound in their advertising dollars, whether it's New York Times, Dow Jones, Washington Post, many of the newspaper companies. There is something fundamentally going on. It's not necessarily just a shift to online. That's a small part of it. But something has fundamentally shifted in terms of how these companies have rebounded. And there is no doubt, certainly in the heart of Silicon Valley, our view is three to five years from now, there will be a new generation of media companies that embody some of the best of some of the great older line media companies. But we will absolutely at its heart have many of the flavors of what a Facebook represents. That certainly is the investor view. Tina. Thank you. I'm wondering if you tell us a little bit about the idea generation process in the company community. There are topics like Google where people have these processes. I don't really get 20% of those times that come up in the ITS. Do you have a full-power process by new generation events? How do you debt it to your customers back in the fall? A lot of the stuff that goes on at the company is really organic right now. And isn't necessarily formalized, although maybe it will be in short period of time as we continue to grow. I think that as organizations grow, a lot of the issues and structure that's put in place is put there because a comfort level breaks down and people communicating freely in a way that they can win their friends. And if you're working with your friend, you can tell him or her whatever you're thinking and it's not going to offend her. And they'll probably comprehend it similarly to how you imagined it. I mean, language isn't really a perfect idea transmission vehicle. And I think that a lot of the stuff, like saying take 20% of your time to go put into action, an idea that you might have is necessary in a large organization where people can't necessarily speak the same language or ideas can get out freely. So I think that one of the things that I do focus on in Facebook is making sure that the culture is very friendly and that people hang out. So instead of having 20% of people's time spent working on their own projects, I make people hang out with each other. And I make people like, I mean, I don't make people be friends with each other, but I mean, you know, like they, you know, what's up? So I think that by doing that, I mean, I can't force people to hang out outside of work. But I mean, I can make it so that people are more comfortable with each other and can communicate more freely. So this isn't really a formal thing though I put in place. This is just like kind of my answer off the top of my head. So I guess like, by doing this, we kind of create a culture where people just talk to each other about stuff and get what each other is thinking more clearly than they would if the organization was more bureaucratic or if like people wouldn't be heard. And then I mean, since people are always talking ideas, get down stuff each other and then eventually like someone starts making something, you know, and then we're done. We have time for a couple more questions back in the middle here. Thank you. What's the interesting conversation when you told your parents, I'm not going to go back to Harvard because I'm going to be the thing called the Facebook. Do you comment on what your parents take on this? So after I almost got kicked out for the thing that I did before this, that also had to do with faces. Their first reaction was, no. But that's when I made Facebook and I was like, no, this is different. This is actually legit. And I think down for this, it'll be fun. I kind of got past that. I stayed in school and finished up my semester and then went out to California. I'm fully expecting to go back to school again in the fall. That didn't happen. But I mean, by the time that that didn't happen, we already had hundreds of thousands of people using the site. And Peter Teal, who was the founder of PayPal, who's our first investor, puts him on the end. And that's sort of in my parents. And I'm like, okay, this is something that could be cool. But I mean, I think that when I first started doing it, they were like, what possible value could this have for you? That was not only cool. So then after it started doing it all day, it stopped trying to suggest that it's true. Good. Right here in the front. What do you see as the biggest challenge for things to look back on forward? What's kind of keeping you up and out right now? Question of course is what keeps you awake at night? What's the biggest challenge? And some of the challenges that will be picked up for your four feet. So I mean, the two things that you focus on are maintaining what you have now that's good and growing. And what we have now is like a pretty good utility. And I'm going back to the first question that he asked me. What's the thing that I measure the most? And it's that 70% of the people come back to the site every day. And making sure that that remains. Not just because we're doing some sort of making things. I mean, if you launch a feature, obviously retention is going to go off. I mean, retention has been out recently because of photos. But focusing on things that are sustainable and scalable. And so that when we launch more schools or go into the next market or whatever we do, that we're going to set ourselves up to have the same success that we've had without hurting ourselves in the current position. So I mean, that's a very vague answer. So I apologize. But it's kind of, it's not one thing. It's just basically maintaining the utility while growing. And Mark is incredibly good at keeping the bar very high on new hires when you're quite groupling in size. In terms of people, there is always a tendency. We see it again and again. And I know Tom Byers and many of you in the audience always talk about quality of people and maintaining the bar. But in practice, it's real easy to say this person doesn't match up in there, but does match up along so many dimensions. It would take six months to find the right person. And Mark has been extraordinary as a leader in maintaining a very high bar. And at times walking away from people who are receiving outstanding recommendations, but they either don't fit from a cultural standpoint, or they're not going to scale and they'd be the wrong person a year or two from now. And that is certainly an investor and board member and ongoing challenge. How do you deal with that tradeoff where you absolutely need an ad sales force. But at the same time, if one person at a time, you just can't say, let's go out and hire five good engineers or five good ad sales people and not happen to be great. Because the B plus or A minus people, you know it. They'll hire Bs and B minuses. And this is a time in the company where you just have to aspire with each higher to get an A or A plus person. And it's easier said than done. I think that is one of the fundamental ongoing challenges.
