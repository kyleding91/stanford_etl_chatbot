 You are listening to the Draper Fisher-Jurvinson entrepreneurial thought-leader seminar, brought to you weekly by Stanford Technology Ventures program at Stanford University School of Engineering. Before Kim became the president and the chief operating officer of Genoma KELF, she worked for the leading biotechnology company in the United States and a company that just won Fortune's coveted best company to work for award and that is Genentech. She had a number of sales and marketing roles with Genentech before starting up with Genoma KELF and she took all of that expertise and experience and has used it to build a great business that is one of the best venture back startups to work for in the world, Genoma KELF. You're going to learn more about her latest venture and lessons that Kim has learned along the way. Kim is also an entrepreneur who has spoken with us before here at ETL and we're delighted to have her back. Kim, welcome to Stanford and to the entrepreneurial thought-leader's program. Well, thank you for the nice introduction. I have to say on a beautiful summer day that we're having here in the middle of winter, I'm honored that you all came in to watch me or hear me speak because I don't think I would have done that. I'm impressed with the attendance here. I will try to make it worth your while and I would really love questions at the end. Please feel free to ask anything about my own personal history career, the Genentech experience or the Genoma KELF experience which I'll focus on mostly today and share with you. I thought I'd talk a little bit about the company specifically introduced you to our product so you can see some of the challenges that we've dealt with in bringing Genoma KELF's product to the market and also the company to the public market. Then talk a little bit about the future where we see things headed in our field because it in fact is a very new area. Tom mentioned the experience that I had at Genentech. I was at Genentech for 15 years. I had the great fortune and opportunity to launch, I think probably 14 different products there, including the last group of products which we launched were the oncology products. Those were the first monoclonal antibodies to really be successful in the marketplace. Launching those products specifically herceptin, a new issue arose and that issue was when we were doing the development of herceptin, which is a drug for the treatment of breast cancer, what we realized is that we were having a hard time enrolling clinical trials because we had to identify the women that over expressed her to in order to get patients in the trial that could possibly benefit from herceptin and allow us to meet our endpoints. So it became pretty clear at that point in time that diagnostics were going to be pretty important to the future of targeted therapies within the pharmaceutical and biotech field. When I looked at our pipeline at Genentech and saw so many other targeted therapies in the pipeline, it was an obvious question, how are these drugs going to then get to the marketplace if we don't have really good diagnostics to sort out the patients who potentially can benefit from the drugs? So as the menu of targeted therapies continues to grow is terrific, especially in cancer, but if we can identify patients that will benefit, then we're really not serving the patients well. So that a bit was the impetus for my interest in genomic health and I can share some of the stories from my colleagues here in just a minute. So when we say, you know, we're looking at a new era in individualized cancer care, what we do know today is that the costs of cancer care are skyrocketing. And some of it is because of these new targeted therapies that are in the marketplace that can cost anywhere from 15 to 40 in upwards, thousands of dollars a year per patient. On top of that, what also started happening at the same time is we began to understand more the genomes. So as the genome was sequenced and we had all of this data, what we were also seeing is that we really weren't turning that data into information for patients to make treatment decisions or for physicians to use in helping patients make treatment decisions. So we had sequenced the genome, we knew there was anywhere between 25 and 30,000 genes, but the next question was, and what are we going to do with this data to make it information and make it valuable and drive it into clinical practice so that it becomes real life usable for patients today that are making treatment decisions for cancer. The last piece of the puzzle for us in the sense of, can we make this happen, was will the marketplace give the same value to a diagnostic product as they currently do to a therapeutic product? So as we talked about what we wanted to do at Genomic Health, a lot of the feedback we got was, yeah, that's great, but diagnostics are a really low margin business. And if you're going to do the type of work that you are talking about doing to bring a high complexity test like the one genomic health currently has in the market to the market, then you're never going to be able to get the value based pricing that you will need to continue your business. So that was a challenge for us in the very beginning. How would payers reimburse for a $3,500 diagnostic test to help a cancer patient decide whether they needed chemotherapy or whether or not their tumor was going to be aggressive? And many people felt no, that just isn't common, that's not what's done, diagnostics tests as you've seen them for blood work, whatever you're talking 35, 50, 75, a couple hundred dollars is really where they are. So we knew going into this that we had to change the paradigm and how diagnostics were looked at because if we couldn't get to a place where diagnostics would be valued like therapeutics or diagnostics, it wouldn't be reasonable to assume you could get a therapeutic like margin on a diagnostic product, then we would have trouble launching our first product, but even more trouble realizing what was in our pipeline or demonstrating to the world that we could bring future products out. So that is the backdrop for some of the conversations that we had prior to starting genomic health. Now I've been a genomic health for about four, exactly four years, just a little over four years. The company was founded about a year before I joined by a gentleman and a couple of his colleagues, Randy Scott. Randy was formerly the CEO of Insight. Randy was on the information side of the business. I mentioned this whole sequencing of the genome. He was a very integral part of that whole project taking place. Randy got really frustrated because again, all of this data wasn't information, had a friend in fact that was diagnosed with colon cancer, and as he tried to help her through her treatment decisions, he became very frustrated with how can you look at this patient and say we really don't know what to tell you except try everything in the kitchen sink. So knowing that we could sequence this person's genome, yet we couldn't tell her anything other than we can just treat you like everybody else with the disease he found to be very frustrating and it really incented him to say we've got to be able to do better and we've got to be able to take the genome information and help patients with their treatment decisions. He then contacted Jeff Baker at Genentech and Jeff at that time was heading up research and discovery at Genentech. Jeff had worked a lot on the oncology pipeline at Genentech and Randy talked to Jeff about, hey I've got this idea. I'm thinking if we could get RNA out of paraffin block, we could determine by using data from 20 years ago, whether we could put a signature together for a cancer patient to help them make a treatment decision. So I'm off at the time so you know it sounds intriguing and I think it's a great idea but let me go ask a colleague of mine who happened to be Steve Schach who was the head of the development group at Genentech and the person responsible for bringing her septin through the FDA. He went to Steve and said hey I just got a call from a former colleague of mine has this idea what do you think and Steve said you know given what we just went through with her septin this has to happen. We've got to be able to figure this out because if we don't we can't launch all of the other targeted therapeutics not just in Genentech's pipeline but in any other biotech or form a company. So Steve and Jeff joined Randy and they literally as you probably heard many startup stories I think in a pool house with some cold Italian food and probably a bad bottle of red wine knowing those guys. Sad and talked about you know could this actually be done. They then spent the next year working on getting RNA out of wax. So anytime somebody gets a tumor biopsy done anytime you ever have a biopsy for anything that biopsy goes in a wax block and it sits somewhere in a hospital wherever that procedure had taken place. And what we knew is if we had those samples and we had the clinical data following those samples following those patients for a 10 year period we could go back and get the RNA out of those blocks. We wouldn't have to wait 10 years to see if the patients. Recurred or died or whatever we'd be able to know because we're 10 years were 10 years later already so the question at the time was with the technology allow you to get the RNA out of the paraffin block in a manner that you could validated in clinical trials and it would be useful. You know for patients and so that was the thing that they spent a year on was getting this RNA out of paraffin block and seeing whether they could get an expression out of it to build these panels that we're looking at today. Well clearly they were successful in doing that and when that when they realize they were successful doing that instead of okay now where are we going to go what kind of business do we want to build with that. That's when I got the phone call and I was at the time you know of course very happy at Genentech and I don't know maybe I should be concerned that they got the number one company to work for after I left and that why I was there but I hope that didn't have anything to do with that and that well deserved a word for them. It's a terrific company. At the time you know my feeling was boy I'm loving what I'm doing I love launching drugs had done it for 15 years at Genentech and in another company prior to that. But I was really intrigued with the idea that the diagnostics and molecular diagnostics to me represented the future of healthcare and to the extent that we aren't going to be able to get these drugs launched if we don't have it and in some ways reminded me of when I was in pharma and made the decision to go to to biotech that was my decision to go to Genentech and I remember back then people would say oh that that biotech stuff is star wars are you sure you want to do that it's a big risk and I thought you know why not it you know it's certainly we're going to be able to do that. It's certainly represented you know to me again a future for medicine never regret of the decision to do it and that's kind of the way I felt about genomic health when I was looking at the decision to leave Genentech was do I think this is really the next frontier would it be something really exciting to work on because I always said to people I would have never left Genentech to launch drugs anywhere else because there wasn't there's no pipeline comparable and there's no you know research and development group comparable so. Hence the decision to come and join this group at Genomic Health and from that point forward what we've been doing is putting together the pieces of how do we now commercialize something that's very different than anything else before it in this space of diagnostics in particular molecular diagnostics i'm adding to our team we brought a CFO and about a year ago and we brought red colon from guidance so he has a another piece of experience and I'm taking some time to talk about the team and I will end talking about people to because it's one point that. I would really hammer home to all of you I believe that you can take really great ideas nowhere if you don't get the right people to help you do it and when people ask me what do you think the strength of genomic health is we didn't invent the technology that we're using we are using a technology in a way that nobody else has used it but I think what we did probably better than most companies or what's really making us successful today is we took the time to go out and what I would say is we're going to do it and we're going to do it. It's really really recruit an all star team so we went to very diverse groups and companies across our industry and brought people in that were really a players and what they did and what's nice about the organization is it like an all star team everybody knows their position they play it well they cover for each other if they need to but it's very clear what everybody brings to the table and what people focus on and I can especially say that with this executive team because if you had a soul in a room together we're all going to do it. We're all very very different but the other point I'll make is as different as we are the thing that I think keeps us very focused on our mission is that we share a passion to help patients with cancer we are absolutely committed and driven by our mission at genomic health which is to help cancer patients and we really you know really all feel like we want to make a difference and we know what role we're there to play so I think the other part that's important is when you can share the values and passion with your colleagues it sure makes making decisions and we know that we're going to do it. It's easy in an organization when we hit roadblocks or speed bumps when we're trying to decide something I can tell you the question that's always asked in our company is what's best for the patient so in this decision what would what would be best for the patient and it always helps us get move ourselves forward so. So to cancer one of the things that's easy for me to talk about our business is I don't have to ask people if they're familiar with cancer I can't imagine a hand wouldn't go up in this room if I asked you if you or a loved one or a friend or a family member ever had to experience cancer the decision for cancer treatment or if you knew somebody that had been on chemotherapy we all do and it's unfortunate that we all do but I think the fortunate side of it is all of the research and work going on in this area we are making some progress and my personal belief is that we are going to see advances in this next. I think that if you talk to people that are experts in the field they probably would tell you they're disappointed with some of the advances over the last couple of decades but I really believe based on what we're doing and what's going on in the development of targeted therapies that we're really on to something that's going to make a significant difference. So the number one thing that happens when somebody gets diagnosed with cancer I mean you hear the C word and you're just you know you're just devastated by that it's a very emotional time and the first thing that you know patients will say is am I going to need chemotherapy and then are there different drugs what drugs would I go to for my therapy and what we realize is that physicians need more accurate clinical predictors right now and I don't think many people probably do know this if you're talking about early stage breast cancer and that's probably the most important thing to do is to get a good job. So if you're talking about the 150,000 or so patients a year diagnosed stage one stage two breast cancer if you're told you have early stage breast cancer about 90% of those patients or more will be offered chemotherapy because in general they'll be told that about 15% of women will recur with the disease in a 10 year period. We don't tell patients and it's just a fact that's out there is for every hundred patients that you'll treat with chemotherapy for will benefit. So you know 100 women get this toxic therapy of which will benefit for the problem is we don't know who the for are. So if you're the patient and you're scared and you want to take every possible measure you can to make this disease go away you'll say to your physician if I have a you know 4% 10% chance whatever I want to take chemotherapy and I certainly wouldn't blame them so what our mission was can we do something where we can figure out who the for are who are the for that are most likely to benefit so we can spare others you know the treatment that is so that can be so devastating. The other thing is that it goes both ways you know miss classifying patients if you look at from from the payer standpoint so knowing that we were going to have a battle with payers for reimbursement why would they want to do this why would they want a 35 hundred pay for a 35 hundred dollar diagnostic well if you're not treating the right patients with chemotherapy you're costing the system a lot of money with all of the the supportive care that goes along with chemo you're also missing patients that probably do need chemo and will recur now the recurrence of cancer is a very expensive thing to do. I'm not going to treat because now you're into a whole different later stage disease which can cost you know an enormous amount of money I mean easily you know upwards of $50,000 or more and today with the price of the targeted therapies it's certainly been much higher than that. So we think that we were leading the way in this whole field of you know molecular diagnostics the first product that we have in the marketplace has about a potential of about 300 million dollars which is you know for a diagnostic I'm hugely successful endeavor and one that we are continuing to work with. We are continuing to work on and I'll talk to you about some of the hurdles that we still have to go the product is in the market we launched it in January of 2004 and the clinical platform that we're using I'll talk about a little bit later we can we can leverage into other cancers and that will be the future of the business and I talked enough about the management team but I a dwell on it for the reason that I think that that's important if any of you are ever thinking about taking a risk and starting something up on your own the number one thing you've got to pay attention to are the people that you bring on your team. So consistent achievement study progress we've had that for the last five years and the point of this slide really is to look at if you know much about drug development you can spend 15 years to get a therapy to the marketplace. What we're doing because we're able to use these archive tissue specimens we're able to do retrospective studies with prospectively defined end points and in doing that we can actually get a diagnostic product to the marketplace in three years so we're really cutting down the development cycle to get these products out because of the way that we're able to do the studies and you can see here just some of the key milestones that we've hit in the last five years. Now this is the product I won't go into it in detail but basically what we do is we give a patient a report just like you'd get a lab report if you got a cholesterol test and we give him a score and in this particular case you'll see there's a recurrent score of ten. So that patient then can take that recurrent score and match it against a clinical trial population that we did in our validation studies to say if my recurrent score is ten then my likelihood of recurrence is x, 7% 5%. So that's where you see the report there on the side. To date we've been in the marketplace since January of 04. There's about five to six thousand oncologists in the marketplace that we're targeting. We have a very small sales force of 30 people and already we've had about 2000 oncologists utilize the essay and most of them have utilized it more than once. So we've gotten some really great traction early on with about 5,000 test order just through the third quarter of last year and of course we'll be announcing our fourth quarter earnings and all revenue in the next couple of weeks. Actually next Monday I think. So how did we do this? This is emphasizing the validation piece of it. One of the things that's nice about the test it's a 21 gene panel and you see the family of genes there across the bottom. These are genes that oncologists would suspect would be involved in cancer in the aggressiveness of cancer or not. So one of the things that we had in our favor is we weren't taking a panel out there with 21 genes that our customers would look at us and say this doesn't make any sense to me. It doesn't make any sense to me that ER or PR or the Grab 7 or her two would be involved in the aggressiveness of breast cancer. So the nice thing is the biology of what we did fit. But now what's what's complex about the test is it takes the 21 genes and it measures the expression levels either upward down as to the signature of every individual tumor to predict whether or not it's going to be a bad tumor or a good tumor. And that's where we get to the score and the report for the patient. So a very simple slide but again one that is at the heart of what we're trying to do here. When we said okay now we're taking this very complex product out as a price tag of $3,460. Pairs are going to be shocked by this. On colleges they're going to say but wait a minute I'm not sure I understand this retrospectively prospective design type trial. We knew we had a ton of education to do. So we have focused on these four blocks for five years and the first one was clinical validation in the diagnostic business you can launch a product from a clear certified laboratory with a lot of validation in clinical data or very little. And there was a point in time where we had a conversation with our board of directors about boy should be launched now or should be wait to complete two or three more validation studies. And our feedback and our opinion was that the oncology community is very evidence based and evidence driven and we didn't feel as an organization that we would have credibility going to the marketplace in absence of really, really solid validation data. So we delayed our launch for a year so that we could get the validation studies done and that we could go to the marketplace with data that would be compelling to oncologists. The second thing that we knew from a payer work and I had spent a lot of time at Genentech working with the payer and managed care groups was that payers want clinical evidence but they also want a peer reviewed and published. So to say here's our study it's done by you know Sloan Kettering and Genoma KELF or the NSWP and Genoma KELF which is a study group isn't enough. They want to see it peer reviewed in the New England Journal or an oncology journal. So we knew that getting our data published was also going to be key. Finally physician adoption because payers will say all right your data is published but physicians aren't using it. I'm not getting a lot of requests for it. There's no need for us right now to make a policy decision on it. So we're just going to wait and see if you can generate any demand. So the generation of the demand and the adoption with physicians was huge and then finally we thought that that would eventually drive the reimbursement at the end. I would say today I'd probably knock that green bar at the end over a little bit more but that's still going to be the biggest hurdle that we get over is making sure that we can get access for all women for this test so that insurance companies are going to reimburse for it. We've got right now I'd say about 20% of the population covered which you know is a lot given where we are to date but certainly not you know as far as that we need to go. So that's where we spend a lot of our resource and a lot of time right now. So I'm not going to go through the data but just to emphasize again we went out there with data in over 2600 patients and we worked with collaborative study groups and investigators that are very well known in the oncology community and that's also key. So when you do your research whatever project you're interested in it does matter who you do it with. You know it matters whether you're with some small community hospital in the middle of Iowa that nobody knows anything about and doesn't know the quality of their work versus being with the leading institution academic center such as Stanford or one of the major cooperatives. Study groups and cancer which are all of which we worked with. So going to the market with this level of data was was hugely impressive to the oncologist and certainly got us out of the gates in good shape. We then I mentioned publications we got our lead validation study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. That was huge for us back at the end of 2004 and I can show you some data when you see the impact of that in just a minute. What we're waiting for now is our subsequent validation trials to be published and so we believe that that will be a real high point and some milestone for the company this year and those have been submitted for publications so we look forward to seeing them soon. The other thing that I would mention that differentiates genomic health from other diagnostic companies for sure is that we are a fully integrated company in the sense that we we decided to build our own sales force our own reimbursement group our own managed care team and our own lab internally. So one option that we had and I think all young companies go through this is do you buy or do you build. So now you've got this technology working you've got this 21 gene panel identified you know you can predict likelihood of chemotherapy response for cancer patients should we package this and take it to one of the big lab companies lab corporate quest to genzine and say here now you do this and will just be a research engine to put more of these products out and other cancers and and also in breast cancer. We looked at that we investigated it with all the major players in our market space and it was interesting because as much as it was tempting to do that because building infrastructure around one product for a very small company with somewhat limited resources is a scary proposition. So you're hiring a lot of headcount that is going to be there if would have it took us three years to get the product to be successful and we had built all of the spend internally but what happened is when we went out and we talked to potential partners nobody believed we could do what we said we wanted to do. And it was a little bit disconcerting because I spent more time in meetings with people saying well you can't do this and you're never going to get that and people won't buy a retrospective trial and you're not going to get reimbursed for $3,500 for this and you're going to have to realize that the diagnostic space is different and you need a huge sales force. So it was interesting for me because I took copious notes through all of those meetings some of them I thought boy maybe I'm starting to get a little depressed here but in some I guess warped fashion it kind of motivated me a little bit more. So I thought well look at these are all the right things to write down because these are the speed bumps we will in fact hit and my background certainly wasn't in the diagnostic space nor was anybody else on that team. So we had to constantly ask ourselves are we being naive. I mean do we really just not get it or do we really think we can make this happen. And so we took all of that information and we sat back down and said you know we're going to go for it. We're going to go for it in a small way but we didn't feel like we could possibly be successful if we put the product in the hands of a partner that didn't believe in what we were trying to do that didn't believe in that we could change the paradigm. I think we would have certainly you know risen to the expectations that they had and not made it so we in turn built a small sales force we started with eight people. We put them in major cancer centers, territories that had you know large populations in a lot of influence. We've been slowly building that we have about 30 sales reps today so we're still titrating we don't have a big sales force now and then we also built the other departments inside so we now have a very strong foundation of a totally integrated commercial infrastructure to not just work with Uncle type DX but future products in the pipeline. So adoption I mentioned to you look at the new England Journal article there coming out in December of 04 and then if you look at the nine months following in 2005 the difference in physician users and in the test that we build over that period of time so when I talk to you about how clinical data can drive the day in evidence with oncology there's a great example of you know knowing what you need when you launch something is hugely important and certainly bringing on the right team of sales folks to do this. Now another thing that we did that is very not traditional of the diagnostics field is we brought reps on that had 10 15 20 plus years of experience selling biotech oncology products. We didn't bring people in from the laboratory side necessarily we went after a rep that we knew could build relationships with oncologists that could handle a highly technical and clinical cell and understood the world of oncology very different than what a lab company typically does. So that was a risk that we took early on so we followed really a drug a drug type launch a biotech product type launch to launch a diagnostic which is unusual in the space and sometimes I had to ask myself if I'm are we just doing this because it's what I know that's how we launched receptions how we launched for tuxen but when we really went out and did the market research it was clear to me that oncologists were not going to be sold on this without that same kind of interaction with their rep. So now the big the last hurdle that needs to or the domino that needs to fall is on reimbursement we've made some great progress in this area the mix that we expect for reimbursement is is here in this pie chart about 70% private pay and the other big piece will be Medicare at 20%. Private payers were doing reasonably well with we've got some big plans now paying and more coming on board as we as we speak so we've done very well with the private pay community again not though where we ultimately want to be most private payers. The resistance at this point is not physician adoption because you saw the adoption is pretty pretty significant right now if they want to see the second and third published papers that we have in for publication right now so they're waiting on additional published data which we hope to deliver soon. Medicare we recently did get coverage from Medicare which was an incredible event for the organization so interesting that Medicare would be the leader in in this area for us and being the first really large part of the market. So we've got a lot of money to do with the other payers to adopt a coverage plan for archetype DX but were absolutely thrilled for patients that this has happened and certainly we think we'll have some influence on other payers to get on board and to cover the test as ultimately we believe the usage of the test will save the health care system money because we'll get chemotherapy to the to the right patients will be right sizing it. that our medicaire denials overturned, I won't go into the detail of it, but learning the whole process through medicaire and what you go through appeals, which we've been doing on behalf of patients has been a very interesting experience and one that I've learned a great deal from. But once again, as a company, we said, do we want to put resources into fighting every single one of these claims for every single patient that gets this assay? And our answer was back to what's best for the patient. And what was best for the patient, if we were all as committed to this, as I said we were earlier, was that we fight this for them. Because winning this for them means that we win this for the future for cancer patients, you know, in every cancer type. So we do do that. For every single patient, we will work through three levels of appeals with their insurance carrier and we've been quite successful in getting denials overturned and we'll continue to do that. Here's an example of one of the things we learned from payers after we launched was they would say, okay, well, you've got the data, physicians are using it, but I want to be convinced that it's really going to change that treatment decision. If that patient gets a recurrence score back of 30, I want to know that they're going to get chemo and if they get one back at five, I want to believe that they're not. So we've started to do some studies now looking at the impact that the product has on changing treatment decisions. Very small study that was done here and talked about at the San Antonio meeting this past December, but looking at this particular group of patients, it changed treatment decisions 25% of the time, which is significant from the payer world. And this happened to be a practice of a group practice of physicians that tends to not use chemotherapy very much. So if you were in a practice that used a lot of chemotherapy, we would expect this number to be even a little bit higher. So again, a step for us to demonstrate that the product will make a difference in impact treatment decisions. Just proving the business model, this past year was our year to say, can we prove this business model? And that's what we're taking into 2006. We've proven to science. Nobody's doubting anymore the work that we're doing and the technology that we're using. I think that hurdle we have clearly crossed, proving the business model is, are we going to continue to get the large payers like Medicare, Blue Cross Blue Shield at Nesigna to pay for this product? And then further this year, can we deliver on a pipeline to show people that this business has legs and we've got other places to go with it? So as these lines start to come together, we'll see that success taking place and we are getting closer. Any company that you build or product that you think about, you have to always be thinking, thinking, okay, where do I take this now in the future? So we put on the type DX out there, what's the competition going to do? What's our next move? And how do we stay leaders in this field? So what we've done is designed a platform that we can easily take into other cancers. So what we will do is look at other areas in breast cancer. So we've got more opportunity with the existing product. And then also looking at the breast cancer market, there's other patients there too, the node positive patients that we'd like to take this product into. So we're doing work in that area. And then finally, you could imagine there's a lot of other cancers out there that we haven't touched yet. So we've begun research in all of these utilizing the same platform, looking at different marker sets and building different panels for these diseases and will announce sometime this year which one of these programs were going to take officially into development. But there's a lot of exciting work being done over there in Redwood City, not too far away. So what is the competitive barrier? We think that the integrated approach that we have is, I can't think, but maybe one, and I'm not sure I'd even say that that particular company is in this league in terms of what we're doing, the research and development that we do on top of the clinical development, the having the direct sales force in our own commercial infrastructure, our own lab in Redwood City, which is a very impressive operation. And then the whole reimbursement support, we've got all the pieces together in one place. That's not that common in the diagnostic world. Now, while other people come and build the same sort of model, I believe they will. I think they'll also find out how difficult it is. So you look at back starting out, we've probably raised $100 million before we got this product to the marketplace. Now, a lot of that we can leverage going forward for future products, but it's not an easy proposition. So it's a different way of developing diagnostics and what traditionally companies have looked at. So I think that for somebody to get into this space, they're going to need to be clear on what they're going to have to invest to get to where we've gotten today and the amount of validation that customers will demand before they'll just move to any other product introduced. Just in summary here, we do think we're setting a new standard in individualized medicine, and that's so exciting for us because we probably, you've all heard the buzzwords, individualized medicine, personalized medicine, targeted medicine. We believe that this really is the first step towards bringing that whole approach to clinical practice. So we finally have a product where we can say to somebody, no, your tumor is not like your tumor. You've got a signature and you've got a signature and that signature matters in choosing a therapy that will be best for your particular disease. So I said I'd start with people and I'd end with people. The other thing that I would never underestimate and I think over the years, some would say, well, these are the softer things in management and companies, but I believe it's the core of why we can do the work that we do. We have an incredibly motivated and driven team. And I would say genomic health is really like a family. Most of the employees that we have, myself included, came to the company driven by family members or our own personal experiences with cancer. So it's just a wonderful feeling to be able to do what we do. And we spend a lot of time making sure we focus on our culture at genomic health. And it's an easy thing to overlook because you get busy and you're operating with limited resources and everybody has too much on their plate. But if you don't take time to stop and celebrate the small successes and the big ones and you don't take time to remember why we're all there, just enjoying what we're doing and focus on the patients. And I think you're really miss an opportunity to really maximize the talent that you have. So, you know, and there are times we have to stop ourselves and say, wait a minute, when is the last time we celebrated something? And it's just a really, really fun place to work with just an absolutely incredible group of people. So I'll stop bragging about them and I'll take some questions if you have them. Let's just curious how you estimated the performance of it. Yeah, what we did is we went out and we took a look. In fact, it's a good question because we, when we went to say what cancer should we start in? So we knew that we had the technology working and then the next question was where do we go with it? Because you could imagine you could go to immunology, cardiology, oncology. We, of course, had a bias towards oncology because of our experiences, but then we had to choose a cancer. And so what we did was some market research on what are the, what's the greatest unmet need in oncology today for treatment decisions and cancer? And it was clearly came back this early stage breast cancer population. And it's a very large population. So there's about 250,000 women diagnosed with early breast cancer each year, about half of which fall into this category of don't know where they, which way they should go. So a lot of it was driven by the market opportunity of the 250,000 patients and the 100,000 or so being in this area of people that we could help. How did you get access to the samples for your study? This will be an interesting evolution, I think, for our whole field because what we did is we went back to one of the big study groups called, it's NSAVP, it's a national surgical adjuvant breast and bowel project. And it was actually a group originally designed to work on colon cancer and moved into breast cancer. They had done the major big cooperative group studies over the years. So they were the group that did the study to demonstrate that women should go on to Moxifin if they were hormone receptor positive. So we knew that they had the repository of the samples and they also had the clinical data because they followed these women out for 10 years. So we went to them and we told them about our idea and we talked to them about using those blocks, those paraffin blocks that they had and we had to make sure that they had patient consent to do research on the blocks and then we worked collaboratively with them to get the blocks and do the work that we were doing. And the reason I say it's going to be interesting going forward is I can't imagine that these blocks have now become little blocks of gold, right? So these are blocks that have been sitting in these cabinets in hospitals for years doing nothing but you're usually mandated to keep them 10 years I think is a minimum and probably most places keep them more. So now that people are aware that you can do this sort of work on blocks, everybody wants access to the blocks but the blocks don't help you if you don't have the clinical data for the patient. So you've got to know what's going on with the patient on the clinical course of their treatment with it. So I think in the future it's going to be, it would be a surprise to me if even pharmaceutical and biotech companies when they start to do their clinical trials, I bet all will want to request tissue to store so that they can do further research on those patients and with their drugs going forward. The other thing that we think is going to be very helpful is if you can imagine today, if you're doing a clinical trial and let's say early stage breast cancer and you've got a drug that you think is going to prevent disease recurrence and you say, okay, we've got to recruit 500 patients for this trial. Why would you want to recruit patients in the trial that had about 0% chance of recurring? You wouldn't, you wouldn't possibly want to do that but it's the only option today. So we see another real value in our test being a product that pharmaceutical and biotech companies can use to select out patient populations to put in their clinical trials and that helps everybody because we get the patients in the trials that have the most likely chance of having disease recurrence. Trials get done faster because they can hit endpoints faster and we can probably do them with fewer patients. So that saves everybody. Money. So the IPO environment and what it's like right now for biotech companies, well last year early in the year, we thought it was quite horrible. So we kind of waited the long the way and we watched and there was a window that started opening up. It looked like I think probably I recall maybe the summertime frame and we decided that we'd go out in September, October or Russian. We were getting out right when the market was kind of coming back a little bit. So we probably picked not a great week to be on our road show. It was a very interesting experience. I don't know if you've ever heard about how road shows go but you literally, we did I think 19 cities, five countries in three weeks or something in 21 days. So you leave your home and you just go where bankers tell you to go and you go in a building and up to the 30th floor and you make a presentation and you get back in the car and you go to the next building and you're I didn't know where I was half the time, let alone, you know, countries, cities, certainly not. So you really, you go around for three weeks and you just present a presentation, not quite like just like this one, but similar. This is what we're doing and this is why we think you should believe in our company and this is why we think you should invest. And when we had the most questions, it was dead on. It was on reimbursement. This all sounds great and the work you're doing is really, really interesting. But are you ever going to get payers to pay for this? I mean, and if you don't, will there be enough of a patient pay market to make your business model feasible? So that was the biggest challenge that we had to overcome on our road show. We were very fortunate that we had a tremendous amount of interest. The other thing I will say is when you go and you talk to bankers back to people, it's amazing how much the experience and the of your team matters to people investing. Because if you've been somewhere, have a track record, have demonstrated success, it is a whole lot easier to have people believe in you than if you're, you know, you're in there without a resume or without a portfolio. So I do think the combined experience of the insight, the guidance, the genentech was certainly helpful for us in making investors feel comfortable that it was a management team they could rely on to deliver. But always a risk. So I likened the road trip after I returned. I said it was like an outward bound experience with no time for reflection. I had never been so tired in my life and didn't ever want to get on a plane again. In fact, the favorite story of our road show among the bankers and my colleagues was a night that we were in a hotel in Kansas City and a bat attacked me in my hotel room. So I have been given more stuffed bats, baseball bats. I've got a bat woman bobble head now. So I'm a bat girl. So yeah, it was definitely an experience. In the market today, you know, I don't, you know, I don't, I'm thinking of some companies that have recently gone out. I think there's several that have gotten out. In our time frame, I don't know that anybody was quite as fortunate as us as getting out in their range. And then fortunately, as of today, we're still trading above the range that we went out in, which was was was very nice. A day. A day special. So are there is there special is a special equipment that we're using or yet? No, we really aren't. So what we use is we do our TPCR is the process by which we the technology that we use. It's a technology available to anybody. Roch makes it. What we've done though is we've just used it differently. So we've stepped up what it's able to do. So for example, most people felt like if you could do get RNA out of paraffin block, you could only get a few genes using our TPCR. We're now up to doing, you know, a thousand genes in our studies with this method, which is not commonly done. I'm not sure it's done anywhere else, but you know, the health. Other questions? So that protects your IP. Yeah, you know, IP is a let me start with what our our philosophy is on that. So when we went into this, we said, you know, our goal would be not to block other people from the space, but to make sure that we always had freedom to operate. So we've approached IP from not a standpoint of we don't want anybody else to get into the space because we think there's a ton of opportunity here. And this has a potential of being, you know, easily, you know, billion dollars plus a market space. It's really more let make sure we have freedom to operate along the way. So what we do, what we have patented and we have several patents filed is more around our process. How we are using a technology, the algorithm or the calculation that's in our in our 21 gene panel, that's been patented. The genes relations to one another, we do some patenting, but you can't patent a gene in the way that we could just take our 21 genes and say nobody else can use those. So what we've done is built strategies around always freedom to operate and also strategies around if we believe somebody else has IP on a gene that we have an invent around a way to use another gene in that pathway that we can still reach our goal in getting our panel together. But that is an important thing in this field because I think there's a lot that, you know, is unfolding regarding IP in this in the whole space of genomic molecular diagnostics. Hello. You mentioned that you were looking at panel with a thousand genes. How are you considering the other platforms besides the PCR, microarrays? We actually have, we consider all platforms. And when I say that we're looking at a thousand genes, we're looking at a thousand genes in our research studies, not anticipating that the final product would ever have, you know, a thousand genes in it. So if I go back to what we did in the breast cancer, we used microarrays, we used RTPCR, we searched the literature and we came up with a group of 250 genes that we thought were bad or good actors in breast cancer. And then we took the 250 down to 50 and then we took it again down to 16 and then ended up at the 21 level with breast cancer. So for the other cancers, what we will do the same thing, we will look at all of the data out there for microarrays, it's in the literature and we'll choose the genes that we think are most important and then we'll bring it down to a number where we think, again, what's the best thing for the patient? So with breast cancer, 21 got us where we needed to go, 30 didn't add more value and 15, we didn't get what we wanted. So we did it that way. Now one of the things with arrays is arrays do best on fresh frozen tissue. Now there are companies working with arrays in paraffin block now, but the most success that people get with the microarrays is using fresh frozen tissue, which is not really a viable commercial medium to use. So you can imagine just having to ship a paraffin block for a sample versus having to get fresh tissue at the time of surgery is a much more onerous process. So we really don't want to go there. However, I can tell you if we thought it was a better approach, we would certainly have in that direction. But in terms of reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity, RTPCR is definitely considered the gold standard in this field. The only reason everybody doesn't use it is that the thought used to be if you did RTPCR, you couldn't look at more than a few genes at a time, and that's what we've changed. What are the kind of diseases can genomic and expression we use for? Well, any disease where you have patients that respond and don't respond to certain therapies. So an obvious one would be immunology, would be a great one where there's targeted therapies, cardiology, certainly there's work being done there. So take, for example, all the statins. Why is it that one patient will respond to lipitor and somebody else will respond to something else? Is there a way going into it that you could find markers that would tell you who's likely to respond and who isn't? So there's I think that the field is just so wide open. There's so many places to go. In its very tempting, because we get calls all the time about, boy, we've got this product for psoriasis. It only works in 10 percent of the population. If we could target the 10 percent, we think we've identified some markers for it. Can genomic help work with us? Same thing in cardiology, same thing in immunology. And it's real tempting, especially for our scientists to say, oh, let's take a look at that, and we have to always go back to know we have a core competency and a focus right now is on cancer, and we've really got to keep our efforts focused there. But that's why I say I think the field is there's just so much room for great work to be done here, and why we really would welcome other players in the space to be able to answer more of these questions, because cancer's not the only disease that millions of people are struggling with every day. Why Redwood City? That's a real easy answer to that. We all live here, love it, and didn't want to move. But I will add to that that we do anticipate that we'll put a second sight up at someplace, because if you look towards your risk factors, right, we've got one commercial laboratory sitting in an earthquake zone on top, and we're probably on landfill in Redwood City, aren't we? But now over time, we will probably put a second sight up somewhere, just because it would be, I think, the right thing to do. And certainly today, we don't have a risk in not being able to supply the marketplace, but I think it just would make sense to put another sight somewhere as we start to grow. Hi, how would you have been sure and see if it would work for your diagnostics? As a neococolisthamian patient, this is a diagnostic being a recurrent patient, will it actually push up its premiums and how do you prevent this kind of discrimination of the, is there a chance that this can happen? Discrimination with the information? Yeah, always a debate. So we don't think so anymore with this than any other diagnostic test in terms of it, but this whole field of genetic discrimination by, does a payer have access to the recurrent score? Now we don't ever send recurrent scores to payers unless they're asked for, and then we always get the patient's consent to deliver that recurrent score. So I would say today, this product doesn't stand in any greater jeopardy for a patient than any other diagnostic test, but I do think those are things over time that are going to be coming into the forefront that we, along with other companies, will need to deal with. Can you have a question about a global market in the cost of joint European respects without where else in the world might go besides the other countries? Well, already we are in a few other countries. We've taken an approach outside of the US by not transferring our technology anywhere and there's all kinds of regulatory reasons why we wouldn't do that, but what we've done for other countries to date is we accept samples from a lot of countries, but in the only country that we've actually set up a formal relationship with, whereby we have a distributor in that country supplying their market as Israel. And that was a specific distributor over there that came to us and has a real handle on the market there and is the main distributor throughout the country. And we're very pleased with the number of patients in Israel that are getting the benefit of the assay. So that's the one formal relationship that we have. Other countries were looking to set up similar relationships, but we, as we did the research on what it would take to go outside the United States, there's not like a single central reference laboratory, the diagnostic market outside of the US is very fragmented. And so to go country by country, when we didn't have the hurdles or the dominoes over here in our country, we said, you know, we're going to hold off and doing that and focus on getting the reimbursement issues in the United States figured out. And I think it was the right thing to do because I think we're well on our way to making that happen now.
