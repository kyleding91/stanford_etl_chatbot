 You were listening to the DFJ entrepreneurial thought leaders series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. So I'm honored to introduce Secretary William Perry as our ETL guest today. Some of you are going to be lucky enough to have one distinguished career. But Dr. Perry has made all his days count. He's been responsible for preparing us for war and keeping us at peace. Some of you might know Dr. Perry as an expert in US foreign policy, national security, and arms control. Or you might have seen him here at Stanford as a professor and senior fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute and the Hoover Institution. And as a director of the preventive defense project, working to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Some of you might also know Dr. Perry as the 19th Secretary of Defense. Or as undersecretary defense for research and engineering when he was the father of the second offset strategy, which used software and semiconductors to build smart weapons, smart sensors, and stealth that helped end the Cold War. But for you engineers and entrepreneurs in the audience, he was one of you. A Stanford graduate and has a PhD in math. He was not only a director of engineering at a large company, GT Sylvania, he then left it and founded a startup, ESL, which was the first company to combine computers and signals intelligence. His work and those two companies made in one of the ten founders of national reconnaissance. And when he came back from his first stint in government, he moved into investment banking, venture capital at Hamburg and Quest, and then later as a founder of technology strategy and alliances. Now, Dr. Perry has gotten more medals and decorations than I could count, and we'd probably be talking all day if I listed them. But I thought it was incredibly cool that he's a night commander of the British Empire. That one kind of, I stopped when I read that one. His book, My Journey at the Nuclear Brink, is the story of his coming at age in the nuclear era, his role in trying to shape it and contain it, and how his thinking has changed about the threat of these nuclear weapons. You should all own a copy. So if you want to understand how scientists and engineers conserve their country and defense and diplomacy, for me, there's no better person to emulate. So please help me welcome Secretary Perry. So Mr. Secretary, I have a first question. I'm not sure you've ever been asked, which is you have a PhD in math. Why didn't you become an academic? I started off my PhD program with the intention of becoming an academic. In fact, my whole life is a set of accidents when you think about it. I never really planned what happened to me in my life. It just happened sort of a random walk process. But about halfway through my PhD program, we had our third and fourth children. There were twins. And my GI bill would run out. And I couldn't live on the cellar I was making. So I went to get a part-time job to supplement my research assistantship. And it was a defense company. I found I liked the job. I found I was good at the job. And so at the time I actually finished my graduate school, I applied both to defense companies for high tech position there and to universities. I got offered to start at universities and I got to tech and I sort of flipped a coin and took the tech company and said, come out. Probably what persuaded me was the company that maybe you offered, you know, I was in Mountain View, California. And I really wanted to come back and be near Stanford. So that helped swing the foot. The real reason was that I couldn't afford to go on to finish my PhD without getting a part-time job. And that was in defense. I'm not turning. So I liked it. And the world's a better place for it. So I'm glad to hear that story. So when you were 37, you were the head of a lab in a big company. But decided to leave and start a startup at the time when there weren't many startups being started. There was no venture capital or barely any. So I did, first of all, what happened in that company that made you kind of like decide to get up and leave? Well, let me set the stage, first of all, for this audience, which for whom entrepreneurial activity and starting a new company is considered the right thing to do. This was back in 1963 before there was a Silicon Valley. It used to be called Santa Clara Valley. In Cupertino, instead of having Apple, had apricot orchards. And when Mountain View, instead of having Google, had truck farms. I mean, there were so much different than you can hardly imagine it. When you can buy a lovely new four bedroom two-bath house for $25,000. So the world was very, very different than. But in particular, people were not going on starting companies. The idea of a startup, the idea of a Stanford graduate, brushing out and starting up his own company was just unheard of. Everybody worked 10, 15, 20 years, another kind of really planned to make the career doing that. So you go back to your question, why did I leave? I had a very good job with a very, very good company. And there were two reasons. I just got annoyed by the administrative apparatus, which is on top of me. The Slovenia, which is a company originally I'd worked for, had been bought by GT&E, which is a big electronics company, a big BMI company. And with that came a whole set of procedures and processes. And just painted the neck as far as I was concerned. And the second thing that happened about that time was that the digital age was starting. To talk to this audience, the digital age was starting, which seemed hard for them to imagine, and just to put in context that all of the military equipment, those are 99% of the military equipment, so you had vacuum tubes in it. It was a very, very different world. But the digital age you could see was going to change everything. I wanted to introduce that big time into what I was doing in my laboratory. The parent company, Slovenia, was the world's largest manufacturing of vacuum tubes. And they understood that some I could actually make a different, they had a semiconductor laboratory. It was very clear to me that they could not seize that opportunity. It's what I called then the liability of leadership. If a company has a leadership position in a particular field or a particular technology, and a new disruptive technology comes around, that almost never is able to seize the new up to, even though they see clearly what the up to is. It's like they have to kill their own baby. And why is it so? It's psychological. It's psychological. Yeah. And the leadership of the company. And the leadership of the company, they've so much invested psychologically and financially also in their current products. They cannot really grasp the idea of bringing a long new product to kill the ones that have been successful for them. So I saw clearly in Slovenia, Slovenia, although they had a semiconductor laboratory, had the head start on all the other companies, well, way ahead of Intel. Well, who has heard of any of Slovenia's semiconductors lately? I mean, they just never made it. Intel took the field. The other clear example at that time of liability of leadership was IBM. Who seized the personal computer field? The largest computer company in the world, IBM, or a non-known upstart company called Apple? So I think this is an idea of liability leadership is very, very important. So at that time you were already? So I saw that liability and I thought I wanted to get out of here and start my own company. And but at that time you just weren't an anonymous engineer. You had a pretty substantial reputation in the intelligence community and you participated in Cuban missile crisis and reviewing intelligence for, I got handed to the president literally that next hour about what was in Cuba. But it was still an incredibly risky venture. How did you fund it? Was there venture capital firms that go to it? It was. I never thought of it as that, risky. I had so much self confidence that we could do it. I suppose that's two of all one, come into words. They just believe they can do it. Who's going to stop them from doing it? That's right. But in fact, on your question of venture capital, back in 64 when we started the company, there was very little venture capital in the... That's the venture capital company you hear of today when you hadn't even started by that time. There were a few and we went and talked with one of them and the media problem was we couldn't tell much about what we were doing. It was all secret work or who our customers were going to be. So that those discussions didn't go very far. Which was a good thing because we decided that instead of going to outside the money we would raise the money ourselves. We would form not as a social company. As a company where employees funded the company but a pure social company, all employees had an opportunity to buy stock in the company. Nearly all of them, maybe 95% exercised that opportunity. We sold no stock outside the company as a matter of policy. In the first year we raised about a million dollars just from employees of the company. That was enough to fund the company. Our company was profitable from the first year and then the ongoing profits fund the later growth. And it was a situation which is hard to relate to today. The main point though, Steve, why this turned out to be such an important decision, even more than I realized at the time, was each of the employees that came to the company, including myself and the other first founders, essentially none of us had any wealth here at the wealth. We had our retirement fund that the company we'd worked for for 10 years. And we took our retirement funds and invested them in the company. So if the company failed, it was not some poor venture capitalist losing his money, it would each one of the employees' life savings throughout the window. Wow. That was a huge incentive, believe me, a huge incentive. To get it right. And when you built the company, there was maybe Fairchild, you would pack your other technology companies as models. What did you decide to adopt and what did you decide to do different in building a culture? I don't know that we made such a conscious decision of doing that. We ended up with a very different culture as you know. It was a Google-like culture today, but Google did it consciously with the reason. They thought this was a good way of bringing in and stimulating employees. We stumbled onto it. We stumbled onto it because we were a company owned by its employees. And so the employees had a lot to do and say about how the company was run and managed. And that just led to an environment like a Google-like environment. A couple of examples of what was unique that was different to your remember? It's hard to point to anyone, things, Steve, but I would say most of them, employees who worked here would say, when I left, it told me there was like a family working here. People felt a bond to each other. It was collegial. I thought part of that bond. And I think all of the one back to the idea that it was an employee owned company. It was their company. I had a Navy captain who was my military aide when I was a Secretary of Defense. And he later went on to command a ship. And his way of commanding that ship, which was quite unmilitary-like, was that anybody would come to him and say, here's a problem. What should I do with it? And he said, it's your ship. It's your ship. Do what you think would be best if you owned the ship. Well that was sort of the attitude in the company. It's your company. What's the right thing to do? It's your company. Do the thing we would do you think is best. Now, you have a view about customers. I remember you transmitted to your employees about how you treated customers and how you thought about them. Maybe you're worth sharing with people today who think that customers exist to buy products. Certainly for our company. I think for most companies to succeed, the leadership of the company has to identify and associate themselves with the customers' problems and try to, you're there to solve their problems. And if you believe that, if you act on that, you end up with a very successful marketing program and a successful company. But you have to believe it. It's not just about saying it. You have to believe it and act on it. So for that reason, we end up with, became very dedicated customers who understood that we took their problems very much to heart. And they were incredibly loyal to you. And I think vice versa. Yeah. We're doing things that were normally sometimes the province of the customer and sitting side by side with them. We were acting like the customer sometimes, but the customer's interest. So back to your days as a land manager inside of Sylvania. And as the CEO of a company working with these customers, how did you sell and convince others that some of the non-consensus ideas that you had for products or ideas made sense when everybody wanted to go down the better version of existing? Did you remember ever having any of those conversations? Yes. We were great at it. I mean, obviously, you have a track or you're doing successful selling disruption. Basically, the technical idea for starting the company was to seize the new products coming out of the digital field, the new semiconductors, and develop products in our field around those new devices. And I was persuaded that it would allow us to make a five to ten times improvement in the performance of the product at lower cost. And to the extent that was true, you couldn't lose, of course. And that would turn out to be two of the most, but I just give you one example, which is easy to understand, I think. We had built for Sylvania a direction-finding system. This is for airplane. You put antennas on the airplane. They received the signal from several different antennas and then compare the wavelength. And determine the direction of the signal. And for reconnaissance, that's a very important. You want to locate where the signal is located. That was a very important decision. The problem with doing that is that the signal came to the antenna directly and also bounced off the wing, bounced off the fuselage, and came in three-throwed of the signal. And so you had a confusing signal and it ended up introducing substantial errors in your calculation. So we would end up with maybe two or three degrees error in location because of that problem. And it occurred to us that because we were using digital technology, because we had small computers that could be right on the airplane, that we could calculate what those errors would be ahead of time, compensate for them and correct them on the fly. And by doing that, we made about a factor of 10 improvement and actually went down a few tens of degrees. So once we had done that, nobody wanted to buy direct surveillance systems from anybody but us because we were the only ones who could do that at that time. It was a simple idea, really. But the fundamental idea was seizing this new technology and saying, how can you apply it adaptively to this new problem? It wasn't just a matter of replacing vacuum tubes with semiconductors. It was saying, once you introduce the semiconductors, it's possible to do things you cannot have done otherwise. And in particular, with a computer that was fast enough, the computer that go on an airplane, there was fast enough to make those calculations on the fly. Was it the thing that changed the game? And was that the beginning of the emergence of many computers from HP and others? Or was that even before that? Well, using what was then called the HP 2000 computer, which is a dinosaur today. It was about that big, had less power than one of your laptops today, but still it was a very powerful computer. It was fast enough. It was small enough that you put on an airplane, it was fast enough to do that job. And did it require for you to have your businesses at ESL to have counterparts in the government who actually thought like you? There were a few, and you find them and seek them out, and then encourage to plant the eyes with them, let them tell them up the line. Now that's a big idea for any entrepreneurs in the audience. You find partners at your customer and you let them take credit for what geniuses they were. Is there anything that you remember in particular who made a difference? I will protect your identity. And some who were still being talked about 50 years later. And look, 50 years later, some of the work I was doing that I just had my book published about a year ago. And before I published it, I had to submit it to the Defense Department for a review, classification review. They weren't reviewing the content of it, but whether I was saying in the class, they took out five paragraphs of the book. And to my amazement, there had nothing to do with the period when I was secretary of defense at all dealt back in the 1960s, and I was doing what I think I'm talking about now. But five paragraphs, we were saying things about programs we were working on, and then they considered it still 50 years later, still classified. Wow. And what do you think that is? I think it's just bureaucratic laziness. They didn't get around to declass, or they should have. But also they were very highly secret, and it was very highly secret. It's a, I talk about security in our country like the Hotel California, once you check in, you can never check out. And now, you were present into the successful company, was growing, and all of a sudden you get a call from the US government that says we'd like you to leave Palo Alto and come to Washington DC, and you did it multiple times, it can't be the pay, where were you thinking? Well what I was thinking was no, I don't want to do that. So I got a call from an old friend, his held round his name. He had been the president of Caltech, and then he had gone back to, he was invited by President Carter to become secretary of defense. He was a PhD in physics, so he was technically back when I was myself. And he asked me if I'd come back to be his undersecretary for research and engineering. And I said no, I mean I wanted, today we talk about entrepreneurs and serial entrepreneurs. People are proud to say they are serial entrepreneurs. I am proud to say I was not a serial entrepreneur. I might plan a simple and plain, I want to take my company and build it into great company. I had no idea of bouncing off with another idea to another company. Well that was my plan, and since I was from that plan, the last thing I wanted to do is leave my company and go back to Washington. So I said no. And after two weeks of protracted discussion back and forth across the country, I yielded and said yes. And which is the right answer by the way. But what persuaded me to say yes was, this was 1977 now, and January 1977. And the president and secretary carefully explained to me that we were in a very serious security issue with those days. I won't bore this class with the whole security issues of 1977, but they have some resemblance to security issue today. But when the World War II ended, we ended up with almost a nuclear monopoly, but we disbanded. We had an army of 10 million men there. We disbanded the army, we disbanded a defense industry. The Soviet Union on the other hand, observing what had happened in World War II, decided that they would maintain a large army and that they would build up a defense industry. They wanted to emulate what the United States had done in World War II. They thought the reason the allies in World War II was because of America's industrial might. That's an oversimplification, but certainly was a major factor in America's industrial might. They said, next we want to win with our industrial mind. So they tried to emulate what we had done. They built up this huge defense industry and maintained quite a large army. So in 1977, all that background, they had an army about three times the size that we had, but which the NATO had at that time. Up until that point, we had said, so what? We have a great nuclear advantage. But by 1977, they had caught up in nuclear weapons as well. Everybody was concerned. There was serious talk, I think, greatly overstated talk, about a window of vulnerability towards a surprise attack by the Soviet Union. There was a lot of concern to the point of hysteria, I would say. But at any event, the serious concern was we had to do something about that. And the president had decided very clearly he did not want to emulate the Soviet Union and the tripling the size of the military. He had a huge cost. It would be a bankrupt economy doing that. Not to mention the fact it would have been very politically unpopular. So he said, we're not going to do that. We want to offset their superiority in numbers with the superiority in technology. That's the magic word, offset. Offset. He went to offset that. And he's seen what I'd done with the company. And he said, what you did was introduce digital technology into your particular field. It was very successful. I want you to now introduce digital technology to all of our most important military weapons. And offset. And use them then to make them so much superior to the Soviet weapons that we will offset their numerical superiority. So we went then to what came to be called offset strategy number two. The first offset strategy we used are nuclear weapons to offset them. The second was to use our technology to offset them. So he gave me the job to offset. And that was a fascinating job. It had about $100 billion a year budget to do that. Kind of like a sternum. You had to multiply that by 10 today to get the equivalent dollars. So there's a lot of money, a lot of resources. And he gave me four authority to do it. So that was just such a fascinating challenge. Aside from being an important problem, it was a fascinating technical challenge. I couldn't turn it down. So I want to get into some of the technical challenge. But just for our audience, the chief of the Soviet general staff after you were done said about the offset strategy, that it was revolutionaryizing contemporary warfare and posed a military threat that the Red Army couldn't match. We cannot equal the quality of US arms for a generation or two. And we'll never be able to catch up with you in modern arms until we have an economic revolution. And the question is whether we can have an economic revolution without a political revolution. And I think that answer came about eight years later. He was like that. He said it. He said it. And a lot of people claim, one of the advocates is that the second offset strategy bankrupted the Soviet Union because they couldn't follow. And the demise of communism was due to William Perry and the second offset strategy. But this really gets back to what you observed when you did ESL, that computers were not just a better version of X, that it was a disruption and an offset back then direction finding another intelligence systems. And now you had a national stage to kind of play this out on. What technologies did you see in shoes and why? And we talk about sensors and stealth and precision weapons. With those already ongoing, did you select them? How did you invest? What did the status quo think? It must have been a heck of a time. It took us about three months to come up with what the offset strategy would be. I mean, it's one thing. That's it. We're going to use technology for years. Three months? How? How? We're going to use it. One of the things we decided right off is we had to make our weapons smart. What do we mean by that? We're doing World War II and doing the Korean War when we dropped bombs at Fard Artillery shells. We never knew exactly where the target was. And so we had to drop 20 or 30 bombs. And we couldn't guide the macros. We had to drop 20 or 30 bombs for every target. And so we thought what we went was one bomb, one target, which would make a huge difference, not just in the actual work, but in the logistics tail that was detailed. So smart weapons is one part of it. And the technology is available then, to focus primarily on laser guided bombs. So we built tens of thousands of laser. We developed and then built tens of thousands of laser guided bombs, which was still today a major component of our weapons. We needed to have a way of guiding things accurately. And the laser turned out to be that. We also had to have a better way of knowing where we were when we fired, if you're in an airplane. So we thought we'd better have a way of accurately positioning. So we developed a global positioning system, which is what we call GPS today. And of course everybody uses it in our automobile or in the handheld navigator today. At the time I wasn't thinking about the commercial applications, but the military applications. We were thinking about Yelp and GPS. So we developed GPS at that time. And as you're using your car, you have to be the thank for that. We also developed something called DARPINET, which later became the internet. All of that was pretty straightforward and obvious applications of things we had been doing. No great leap forward in imagination, just leap forward technically. What was the leap forward in imagination was building an airplane that could not be detected by radars. Airplanes, a key component in military warfare, have been since World War II. And because it's our key, every country has developed systems for shooting them down. They've evolved radars and missiles, the fire at them. So surface-stair missiles, which are guided by radars. So we wanted to develop an airplane that could not be detected by radars, and therefore they could be not shot down by missiles. And that became because it's not still being sent, you couldn't see it. If the F117 to be too slow, or when you look up, it'd be quite obvious to you. But the radars couldn't detect it. And so they had completed impunity at nighttime. They could operate at night without it. So the stealth was a third component of the three major components. We just sat down then the first three months, and then pulled out all of our throttles to move forward. I wanted to have them done by the end of the, I don't want to stay more than one term in government. So I wanted to have them done in the four-year period. Indeed we had the first stealth airplane flying just before I left office and four years later, which is pretty unusual. You don't get the paperwork then usually for four years in the government. And so, but how did the status quo treat these programs? Did you get opposition? Note the laugh with the horror. There was a mixture of reactions to it. The principal opposition, and was really an organized group, which called themselves the group for defense reform or something. There was a against introducing technology into the military on the grounds. And they particularly were opposed to things we were doing on the grounds that they would make weapons to complex for soldiers to use. So complex they would break down in the field. And they'd be so complex to be too expensive. Another day, the usability, the reliability and the cost, they thought would be all too high. Which is two of some kinds of complex that you introduce in the system. But in fact, if you back in those days, they just introduce something called the HP 35, which is if you look back at handheld calculator, which is about the size of your iPhone today, small iPhone. And that machine did all of the calculations that the disk calculator did, and a lot more for less cost. It was less costly, it was more reliable, and it was easier to operate. So all of the things that they were bringing up against were just in the opposite direction. They mistook complexity for new technology. So the new technology actually was cheaper, simpler to easier to operate, and more reliable, much, much more reliable than the old technology had been. And was the opposition in the military itself or in Congress or? The military. The military was mixed, but there were a lot of people in the military who were hoping we were right. And we're willing to go along with it. Most of the opposition came from outside the military. It was very, it really stayed with us for about 10 years until Desert Storm. The first test of this new technology came in 1989, I guess it was, almost 10 years later after we developed all this stuff. In Desert Storm, the F117 flew over Baghdad a thousand times, I mean a thousand sorties over Baghdad. Baghdad at that time was the most heavily defended city in the world. They had hundreds of modern Soviet-built surf steer missiles. And those thousand sorties wasn't a single wear plane shot down, not one. They flew them all at night, they should have done. And there were thousands and thousands of rounds fired at them, and they never hit a one. So a thousand missions and no wear planes shot down. So the stealth worked like a charm. They carried laser-guided bombs, as we talked about here. Two thousand, those one thousand sorties dropped two thousand bombs. 80% of them made direct hits on the target, which again was an unprecedented level of accuracy. From that point on, nobody in the military doubted the effectiveness of it. And the critics who just sort of disappeared, they stopped talking. And there was a rare opportunity to prove a new technology in such a dramatic setting. Wow. That's, you know, if the story ended there, that would be an incredible life. But you had almost a second career in diplomacy, which is the opposite of preparing for wars, actually waging peace. And you did just an amazing story there. But before I get off on diplomacy, I do want to ask you a question, is we were talking earlier before we came on about there's now a search for a third offset strategy. And maybe we could talk about that for a minute or two, and then we talk about diplomacy. Why are people searching for, why is the US government searching for third offset strategy? Well, go back to Deadlet's dorm. We were facing really the fifth largest army in the world, and 4,000 miles away from our home bases. And they were defeated. They were routed in five days. And that made a huge impression, profound impression on militaries all over the world. So all of the other militaries said, what can we do about that? And the two obvious choices, one of them is we tried to emulate it, which is not so easy. If you don't have the technology based in the first place, or we can try to work around it. Work around it means we invent something called asymmetric warfare. And the nations that were the smartest, the adversaries of the spars, went to add asymmetrical warfare. And- Can you give us an example of asymmetry? Urban guerrilla warfare. None of the things I've talked about, none of the technologies I've talked about have any relevance to that. So why should they fight us and things were good at? Fighting things were not good at. The intelligence systems don't work in a urban guerrilla setting. The intelligence to the benefit of the guerrilla is not to the other way around. So that was the way around it. So we, I think, became overconfident. We thought this, because we had this capability for defeating an army in the field, we could do anything we wanted to. And so the second work came and we had our head handed to us in my opinion. We quickly defeated the Iraqi army, the second time around, just like the first time around. But that turned out that wasn't the real war. The real war ends up being fought in the cities. It was a urban guerrilla warfare. And we did very poorly in that. So began to dawn on people that the military has to be tailored to deal with what the threat actually is, not what we would like it to be. And the military we had designed to fight attack warfare in the desert wasn't the problem we were going to be facing. And so that led people to think we need a new offset strategy to deal with these new kinds of threats. The new threat to different in nature, their guerrilla warfare, their cyber warfare, they might be conflict and space. You can think of three or four or five possible threats to our military for which the army we built isn't really appropriate. So when the new Secretary of Defense came in a year and a half ago, Ash Carter, who had been by the way my assistant secretary when I was a Secretary of Defense, and he was very familiar with all this offset strategy stuff. Another PhD. Another PhD, physics, physics, it's okay. I did PhD within theoretical physics and Renaissance literature. He's a real Renaissance man. So he decided he was going to try to introduce offset strategy three. And it just got started a few months ago. And he's been one of the things he did to realize that, recognizing the importance of digital technology and information technology, what he wanted to do was he set up an office out here until it got in Valley. It's called D.I.U. Act which means what defense? Innovation. Innovation, unit, experimental. Yeah. And so do you think he found it? Is there a third offset strategy yet? I don't know. It's a tough job. It only took us three months to cooperate with what we wanted to do in the last time around. But the new retrospectives are a lot easier to draw than what he's facing now. He's been working on this for six months now and have not yet come up with a concrete strategy. Because back then we had one nation state facing us which was so union with conventional weather. And it was easier to think of. It was easy to describe. I went to hard to deal with it. It was easy to describe anyway. This was not quite so. Now we have non-nation states. We have nation states. We have, it's kind of a messier. In fact, it's a very different problem. And I think it's much more difficult problem that he's facing. And technology may well play an important role in the only, but certainly not the only role. And he's trying to figure out how to tailor the technologies to deal with those particular problems. That's what the offset strategy is all about. And so that kind of gets us a segue into almost the second career where you were starting your first and then it was diplomacy. And I remember President Carter actually kind of put you on some diplomatic missions at the time for diplomatic negotiations with China as well as Israel. On Egypt following the Camp David agreements, how do you feel about taking on this expanded role? Did you think of yourself as a negotiator? Was there some manual that they gave you to figure out how to do that? I didn't think there was anything special about negotiating with people that you had to think of what they're trying to achieve, where they're coming from, and listen to them, to learn that. To the extent as an art in negotiation, it comes not in the brilliant things you see. You say, but now carefully, you listen. And so diplomacy, to me at least, a big part of it is listening to what others are saying, trying to figure out how to accommodate them. Can you give me an example? That's an interesting insight. Is there anything you remember that struck you that no one was hearing? Well, when I was secretary, we had a tragic situation in Bosnia, whether it's sort of a civil war going on there between the Bosian Muslims and the Bosian Serbs, and hundreds of thousands of people being killed and millions of displaced were put in a concentration camp. It was the worst atrocity since World War II, really. And the NATO peacekeeping mission had been sent in there to deal with, there was totally it out of what they couldn't handle it. To find the NATO decided to send in the NATO force to bring order to the country and to stop the killing. And then they said, and get it, people go back to their homes. And the problem, one of the problems in doing this, where the NATO readily agreed to do that, and the United States was leading the mission. But there was Russia. Russia is a sloppy country, and Serbia is a sloppy country. And there's a brotherhood relation between them, really. And so they were by God's send in a brigade also. While having a brigade of Russians and a brigade of Americans and a brigade of British, under different commands, fighting a war, it seemed like a very recipe for disaster. That's what we're doing in Syria, by the way, today. But there was a big, larger scale going on in Bosnia then. So President Clinton and President Danielle Sen agreed that we were to have a unified force. They didn't know how to do it, but they said we ought to have one. And they turned to their defense minister. My, myself in the case of Clinton and, and, and, and, and minister Grachov in the case of Russia, and said, solve this problem, find a way of bringing these forces under one command. So that was my, my greatest exercise in negotiation, I think. How do you solve the problem? Because I heard, I, the word that I heard most when those negotiations was Niyet, over and over again. And it took us four meetings, really. Over a period of two months, we had two months to solve it. And I met once in Geneva, once in Washington, once in white, many of our force based, and then finally, and once in Brussels, and finally the third, third meeting, we got a, a formula for solution in the fourth meeting, we signed it. But it was a question of listening to what was really bugging. Grachov, why he didn't want to do that. We finally ended up, he put his brigade, one of the best brigades reporting to an American division commander. Wow. There's a brigade in our, one of our divisions. He did not want it reporting to NATO, because willing to have a report to an American commander. Wow. And it took me a while to, you know, I'm a slow learner, it took me three meetings and I figured that out. That's what was really bugging. We finally got a solution to it. But it's listening to the other people. Well, and that's like, let me into something you said in your book, which I, about Russia, which I thought was just a little sobering. If I got it right, you said that in less than 15 years, the relationship between the US and Russia went from being quite positive to an all-time low. And you listed a series of policy decisions that we've made, and that you believe contributed to the deterioration of relationships. And I won't list them all, but what do you think we should be doing? Is there anything solvable with Putin, or is it some of it on us? There are many significant problems of facing the day that seem to be getting worse on a month by month basis. And I don't think we can solve any one of those problems, but just by attacking that problem. We have to get at the underlying issue, which is the hostility between the United States and Russia today. I think nothing can be solved without addressing that problem directly, and that has to be done at the highest level. It has to be present, present, to deal with that. And that's not happening. It's not likely to happen in the near future, because based on their experiences with each other, President Putin and President Obama do not like each other at all. To say that he'd each other, maybe too strong, but he'd to be in the same room with each other. It was a bad situation. And I think each of them ought to be able to sort of get over that and work for the common interest, but that may or may not happen. What I and Senator Non have proposed is that we at least go to Russia with the proposal that we form a working team, high level working team, to deal with the problem of nuclear terrorism, which is equally a danger to Russia as it is to the United States, and find a way of working together on that one problem. If we can do that, if we can succeed on that one problem, then maybe we can work for broader, broader basic cooperation. For the President's job is to define those areas where we can cooperate and try to make that cooperation happen, identify the other problems where we have completely hostile ones and not going to cooperate and isolate them, minimize the danger from those. That's an interesting way to think. I just got smarter right there. But find the areas of common interest. There must be between nation states. Certainly. Certainly, the danger of nuclear terrorism. And I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to go off and mask, and mask how it is in Washington. And I do want to spend time on that, but let's just take what you said about Russia finding common interest is the same truth for China. Are there relationships that deteriorated and we need to find some common interest or is there different issues going on there? Ask me that again. Are there different issues that are going on with China than there are with Russia? Oh, yes. A huge difference between the U.S. and China versus Russia is we have a very profound economic relationship with China. Huge trade, bilateral trade with China, exchange of technology. But many, many common interest we have with China. Every reason, every objective reason said that the United States and China ought to be working together on a friendly basis in cooperation to advance the common interest of both countries. And to a large degree that has been happening, because it's been notable exceptions in the last few years, which worry me a lot. Which ones are those? Well, the most obvious ones are the, back up a little bit. It was earlier a major problem over Taiwan. And we worked very hard, I think. I worked when I was in office, I worked in a zout of office, and the presence of work very hard to resolve that problem. I think today Taiwan has gone away as an issue between the United States and China. That's very unlikely that it would be a war between China and Taiwan that might drag the United States into it. And that's a separate issue and I don't want to discuss it right now. But good things have been done that area to mitigate that problem, I think. But more recently, the problem has come up in the South China Sea. And there's a clearly, clear difference of perception between the United States and China about what the South China Sea is. We look at it as international waters where our ships can pass freely. And some in China, we regard it as sort of a Chinese lake. And that they have rights to and have rights to keep American ships, American planes out of, so on. The difference is a very good, not just with the United States, but with the Philippines and with Vietnam, Taiwan, all of those countries, but particularly the Philippines, I think, and Vietnam have major disputes with China over the rights of our rights in the South China Sea with respect to ownership of violence, with respect to rights, drilling rights, and so on. So there have been disputes for maybe a decade between Vietnam and China and between Philippines and China. The United States was taking off the side and taking a look all week here about it as we don't, we want these issues to be resolved peaceably and we want to maintain sailing rights, steaming rights through the South China Sea. This has been being brought to our head there by the Chinese starting to build air bases. On some of those are making a reef and building an artificial island putting an air base on it. And that's leading, I think, to some kind of a showdown, which I'm very concerned about. And do you think the Chinese looking for a showdown or doesn't think they'll get them? It doesn't make sense. I mean, it doesn't make sense, but I have to say I fully do not fully understand what's behind the new Chinese president, who is a very different, very different leader than his predecessors have been. All the way, going the way back to the day? Well, since 1980, I'd say 83, 84. All the leadership is working towards a cooperation with the United States and not making waves on territorial issues. But I don't know. I just don't know. I can't really say where this new leader is headed, but it would be a huge mistake, a tragic mistake if the United States and China were to get in some sort of a military conflict over the whole of these relatively minor issues on ownership of who owns this reef and who owns that reef. They seem to be symbolic of something. They're symbolic of something bigger for China. They're certainly symbolic. The underlying symbolic issue of China, I think, has been their righteous grievance over the abuse they took for 100 years by Western power, mostly not the United States, mostly European powers. They call it a century of humiliation. That's a serious issue in China, and that's one which they have, I said, a righteous grievance. But now they bring that forward into the modern day, they're thinking forward into the modern day, I think, could lead to Miss Chief. And then let me segue from China a bit to something else you were personally and deeply involved with, which was North Korea. In fact, if I remember, you stated we were this close to having an agreement in 2000, and then five years later, we were facing a nuclear arm North Korea because of some policy decisions that have been made on someone else's watch. Are you optimistic or pessimistic or... I'm pessimistic right now. How do you think that's going to end up? We've had problems in North Korea many times in the last 30 years. Over their aspirations to have nuclear weapons, and up until the year 2000, we were able to hold off those aspirations. And I went to Pyongyang and met with the leadership in North Korea at the request of President Clinton in 1999, I guess it was. I was out of office by the time he asked me to go over his personal long way to deal with North Korea. And I made a proposal to them whereby the United States would recognize them as a four-kind war. We don't have an embassy in their country, for example. We would recognize them. We would give them technical assistance. We got both South Korea and Japan together with economic assistance. And in return, they would give up their nuclear weapon program and long-range missile program. And we were very close to a deal, I think. President Clinton was ready to sign a deal. They sent a senior military person over to meet in Washington, said they were ready to sign a deal. And funny thing happened was an election of a new administration command in 2000, an election of 2000, a new administration in January 2001. I was not too much concerned. I'm sorry that we hadn't gotten it done ahead of time before the election, but we didn't. Talked with Colin Powell, who was the incoming Secretary of State. He said, not the worry. We'll bring this deal to conclusion. And two months later, the South Korean President came back to meet with President Bush. And President Bush said we're cutting off all discussion on North Korea. And for two years there was no contact at all. Next thing we knew they were starting to build nuclear weapons. I've oversimplified a complicated story, but I think we made a major misstep there. I think we could have stopped the program. Now I don't see any good way of stopping it. They have a dozen of maybe more nuclear weapons. They're building more of this material. They're testing long-range missiles, they're testing submarine missiles. So I think we let ourselves in for a serious unnecessary problem. And do you think they might be a pull-up for a deraise? Is there what? Are there any people operating nuclear weapons? There's certainly a proliferator. There's been two ways between them in Pakistan. Some of their technology came from Pakistan. And they have also a situation to Pakistan. They sold a nuclear reactor to Libya, and a part of me. I mean, Syria, which the Israelis obliged the Syrians by bombing. So it's not an existing study board. But it came from North Korea. Which was not legal. Well, on that high note, you and George Sultz and Henry Kissinger and Sam Nahn are still working to reduce the nuclear threat. Can you tell us about why you're doing that and what you want to see that? In 2006, October 2006, with the 20th anniversary of the Iraqi-Vix summit. Some of you may have never heard of the Iraqi-Vix summit. But in one of President Reagan's, I think most purely in diplomatic strokes, he met with the then President Gromyshev of Russia at the Iceland capital of Reykjavik. And they talked for two days without notes, without AIDS, except after he chose who was there. Not the idea of giving up nuclear weapons altogether. It was a unique and unprecedented event. That was the way. In the end, they could not come to an agreement. But they talked about it. They could not come to an agreement. And just 20 years before the anniversary of that, George Schultz said, why don't we have a Stanford conference seminar? What is the conference? In the Iraqi-Vix summit, we visited 20 years later. What were the lessons in the Iraqi-Vix summit? And so we did in 2006. And the conclusion of that seminar at Stanford was that we ought to revisit the idea of eliminating nuclear weapons. And Schultz and Samnan, who was there myself, and then we later got Henry Kissinger to join us, band it up to write a not-ped for the Wall Street Journal, which said just that. Number one, nuclear weapons today are more of a danger than they are an age of security. And number two, there always be a danger until we find a way to eliminate them. And in the meantime, we ought to find ways of reducing their danger. That was the essence of the op-ed. And it caused quite a stir of not because the ideas were so new, but because the ideas were coming from four people who were certified and called warriors. I mean, I'd help build up this nuclear arsenal as head Schultz and as Nund, and as Rollins Head of the Senate on Service and the Committee, as Kissinger as Secretary of State. So you were now a bunch of rivals? So this was a dramatic statement coming from these four people. It caused quite a stir in the international community. And it actually caused some progress along that line for a number of years. The most dramatic progress came when President Obama was elected in 2008, because just two months after he was inaugurated, he went to Prague, gave his first international speech as a president, which among other things, he said, I state with conviction the intention of the United States to seek the peace and security of the world without nuclear weapons. There's a stunning statement coming from the President of the United States in the stunned world. And for a couple of years after that, we actually progressed in that direction. We had made another armoured treaty with the Russians where we each agreed to reduce nuclear weapons. I think one of the most important things of President Degrees started something called the nuclear summits, where the 50 nations that have fissile material, fissile material that takes to make a nuclear weapon, but also used to run nuclear reactors. 50 nations had that fissile material came together and found agreed on improved ways of controlling that fissile material so it could not fall into the hands of a terrorist. So for about, I'd say, four or five years, a lot of good progress may. Now there's been a red regression. The red regression, I think, sinks almost completely with the growing hostility between the U.S. and Russia. Because Russia then said, we don't want to have any more arms treaty, we don't want any more arms negotiations with the United States. And they started building a whole new round of nuclear weapons. The United States now decides we need to build a whole new round of nuclear weapons. So we have the Cold War and nuclear arms race starting all over again. So we're moving backwards now. Well, I'm not sure he knows. But before we take some questions from the audience, the last question for you is, what role can Stanford students, entrepreneurs play in solving national security problems, engineering or policy problems? What can students do? When it came to my example, I didn't even start addressing these problems twice, twenty or so years into my career. Well what I had done in my career, which is a technical career, it would not be hugely important background for what I ended up doing. So even if you have this aspiration, you don't have to move directly to it. You move to developing your skills so that when you do decide to direct them to security problems, you have those skills already. But beyond that, if you want to address the issue today, I'd say the first thing you need to do is understand what the issues are. Take the time to study and understand what the issues are. The many sources available for you to do that, including courses at Stanford. So the first issue is get smart on the issues. And the second, if you've done that, is start to involve other people, your friends, your colleagues, your family in the issues, bed to word. Because the reason we are slipping into another Cold War into another nuclear arms race, because the people in this country do not understand the dangers of what's underway. What is happening? Not as about to happen, it's already in process of happening. And so we have to have a better educated property. So it's a delayed gratification in saying education. But you have to education, that's the first step. And you have to help educate others. If we become an informed citizenry, then we'll take informed intelligence and actions. We are not today an informed citizenry on this problem. Okay. Well, thank you, Mr. Secretary. What I'd like to do is take at least a question or two before we end. Who has a question? Yes. Okay. I was curious. I came a little bit late, so I hope you didn't talk about this at the very beginning. But could that third edge or whatever, could it be something related to cyber security? Could you talk about cyber security? So the question is, can cyber security be one of the components of the third offset strategy? Cyber security is one of the most important components of the third offset strategy. Already that's already pretty well established. Yes. Good question. Great question. Other questions? Going once. Cyber security is an asymmetric warfare, really. Yes. Question. I was at a Zika conference yesterday and it was brought up, even closing the Olympics down or moving someplace else. Because there's a question about the Zika virus? Yeah, the Olympics and that. There was brought up closing it down even. And what's the question? Thoughts on the Zika virus and the Olympics. Thoughts on, do you have any thoughts on Zika virus as a national security issue or as a security issue? I don't know anymore about the Zika virus than you do. But what I read about it, it sounds like a serious problem. Other questions? Yes, right there. How do you see Iranian and American relations developing going forward? So the question is, how do you see Iranian-American relationships going forward? I think the agreement that was made with Iran on their nuclear program was unnecessary, but not a sufficient condition for established good relationships. It was certainly necessary. It poised the Zahs and the poised Iran to try to work together in a more cooperative and friendly manner. So it's possible now for that to happen and I hope it can happen. There's a lot of opposition in the United States. I have to do it to read the newspapers to understand a lot of people not only don't want that cooperative relationship, but they didn't even want the nuclear deal. There's a lot of opposition to it. There's also a lot of opposition in Iran to it. We've got Assad, but the Iran revolutionary guard is a tirely opposed to the deal and they want to go ahead and build nuclear weapons. They're very clear about that. So there's a big opposition of both countries who will prevail remains to be seen. One can hope that in the United States at least it will move forward trying to seek a positive relation with Iran. The last time I visited, I've met four times with Iranian officials. Now one is now the foreign minister and the national security adviser talking about this problem. It's trying to see if I could, this is before we act to start negotiating. See if I could find a foothold for our negotiators on this. And I was persuaded that we could make a deal with them. Although the deal we ended up with, I would say it's better, more favorable than what I thought would be. I also visited Iran a number of times. Most recently, as a tourist and met with a lot of Iranians, there's a well sping of good feeling for Americans among Iranians. Whatever the government says it does, there really is a basis, I think, for a positive relationship. So I'm truly hoping we can get something going positive with Iran again. It's stupid for us to be at logger into the Iran. Well, Mr. Secretary, I got smarter this the last hour. So thank you very much for your time.
