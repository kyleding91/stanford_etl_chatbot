 You were listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at edcorner.stanford.edu. Peter has had a fantastic undergraduate career. I mean, you can read about it in your notes. He's got an MD-PhD. He's got the undergraduate degrees from MIT. He has a passion for spaceflight and just basically opening up space for humanity. And I find that really exciting and just amazing. I've met a lot of entrepreneurs in my 20 years of being in Silicon Valley and my 10 plus years of being involved in the venture business. Every year or two, I meet someone who absolutely loves what they're doing and it was a childhood dream of theirs and they're still doing it. And they actually love it. And Peter's one of these people. So it's really my pleasure to introduce Peter. And really what I wanted to do is talk about Peter a little bit with him, about what form Peter, how he came to these ideas, what basically empowers his passion for this and then talk about how X-Prize was formed and where X-Prize is going. So it's my sincere pleasure to introduce Peter to all of you. Thank you, Peter. You're very gracious with your introductions, my friend. Thanks. So what led to the passion, Peter, spaceflight? How did you get there? You know, I feel like I'm one of those very lucky people who had a calling in life. And those of you who know what I mean, know what I mean. It was, for me, it was probably around the age of eight or nine that I was born in 61 to put an age on myself. And Apollo had just started and I was sort of becoming conscious during the period of time when Apollo was happening. Apollo 11, for those of you who don't remember, landed in 1969. It wasn't really that. I think it was Apollo 13 and the troubles they were having around Apollo 13 that got me start and thinking. And it was one of those things that hit me. It was like, wow, my mission in life is this. And it was, you know, it is to open up the space for an tier. How did you know that? It's just inherently in my heart. It was something I knew. And when I talk to schools in a particular setting like this, you know, what I say is, if you're not sure what you want to do, go back and figure out what you were really passionate about as a kid. Because no matter what you do in your, you can make a career out of anything. You can, you can make a career out of anything. So it might as well be something you really, really, passionately love. Because if you're going to do anything really big in this world, it's going to be hard. And it's going to fail over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. And if you don't love it, you're going to give up along the way before it happens. And I can tell you from the course of the dozen companies that I've started, not all of which have succeeded, but the ones that have succeeded in our round today, they failed 100 deaths along the way. And I would have given up if I were not just so passionately in love with the things I do. And so I just, I give that to you. So as a kid, you know, I grew up in a Greek family like George did and it was like, son, you're going to be a doctor. Okay, I'm only going to be an astronaut. Well, it's nice, but you're going to be a doctor. So I ended up, you know, going through medical school, I got my diploma and I bolted, you know, I had two companies going my fourth year medical school in the space business, of course. Of course, of course. I was following my heart. But, you know, it was, you know, at the end of the day, all these things are hard and you really have to do what you love. Because that's where you're going to have the greatest daydream about it. You're going to have the insightful insights and the brilliance and you'll be most passionate in communicating to people about it. And therefore, the one who invests in you, you'll be happiest during it. So everything aligns. If you're doing something for somebody else, life's too short. Stop. You know, go and do something that you are absolutely excited about. And if you don't know what you're absolutely excited about, take a moment to think about it and go and remember what were you excited about as a kid. So I'm sure there are lots of risks along the way. Did you think about them along the way as risks or do you think about where you needed to get to and not even think about the risk? I actually, I can tell you that I took a lot of risky maneuvers in my career, you know, sort of packing up and going. And it was not, it was when you're so in love with the things that you're doing, you don't stop and think about it. And I didn't. I just, you know, when an opportunity came along, I sold my house in the day and moved across the country to take advantage of that opportunity. It was, I was married at the time, but what was the opportunity? So, so in 1999, you know, sort of the peak of internet funding, I was running the X Prize Foundation, which I can talk about more later. I was running a company called Zero Gravity Corporation as parabolic weightless flights. And I, and I co-founded a company called Space Adventures that sends people to orbit. We've sent five people to orbit for average 20 to 30 million dollars each. We have our sixth customer going to orbit now, Richard Garriott. And I got a call one day from Bill Gross, who runs Ideal Lab. And if you guys know Ideal Lab, they had started E-toys and go to and that zero and cars direct a number of companies. So Peter, I just raised a billion dollars. And I want to do a private moon company. And so, loses for people to have their own private moon. Yeah. I want to build a company to privately land a robot on a lunar surface. And I've got $60 million set aside. And so I literally sold my house in day and moved to Pasadena. Took X Prize and Zero G and everything with me and was starting to build a, you know, I have a vision that we're at a very key point in time where the entire space industry can become privatized and the economic engines that drive space can move from a government funded scenario to a privately funded scenario. And I've been trying to work on pulling together my, you know, mini version of my own private space pulling different parts and pieces. So, where do the early ideas for Zero G and X Prize, the foundation, get started? How did you come up with that? So, the year is 1992. It's called the, you know, it's a 500th anniversary of Columbus. And it was also called the International Space Year, sort of a tribute to, to the Columbus Heritage. And people said, in 1992, we were supposed to recommit to go to Mars to the Moon and Mars and also complete the International Space Station. And in that year, what hit me was that none of the stuff had happened. The government was a lame duck. That none of it had actually materialized. And I stopped and I asked myself, could the government actually open up the space frontier? And in my mind, it became clear that they could not. That the government was no longer able to take the levels of risk, nor could private companies, large private companies, take the level of risk required to open up this frontier. Because literally if there was like a challenge or a Columbia, you know, NASA shuts down for two years as congressional investigations. My God, how could you possibly lose six lives? Well, we lose 50,000 of the roads every year. We don't stop the highway system. And large corporations, you know, their stock price will plummet. So I said, you know, the types of real breakthroughs required to open up the greatest frontier ever, at least physical frontier, can't be done any longer in the government's or large corporations. So it hit me that at that point I needed to focus on private companies. And so I looked at how did we really take other industries forward? And it was on mass markets, airline, internet, PCs, all these things that were hugely expensive only for the wealthy people, became accessible to everybody as the mass market materialized. So for me, it was, what are the mass markets involved in space? And it was tourism is one large mass market. And so some of the companies, zero gravity corporation, space adventures, and part of ex-prize was in tourism. Entertainment, you know, Star Wars has multi-billion dollar portfolio. And so Rocket Racing League came out of that. And eventually, my long-term mission is I want to be an asteroid minor. If you think about it, the average nickel-iron asteroid, half kilometer in size is worth about $30 trillion in platinum markets. Which is bigger than the credit crisis. True. Now my financing plan for this is I'm going to buy a puts on the platinum market, announce my mission to go retrieve the asteroid, cash it on the puts, and then go finance the mission to go. Got it. So don't, well, in the humor there's some truth, right? There is. There is. I remember you told me about the early days of ex-prize and how you would finance it. Like that's a great story. And so, originally when the, you know, people don't believe, the ex-prize came to me as I was reading a book called The Spirit of St. Louis. Lindbergh wrote this book in 1957 that, in 1955, they talked about his flight across the Atlantic. And I had no idea that Lindbergh actually crossed the Atlantic to win a prize. I thought he woke up one day and he just decided, you know, go east, young man. But there was a $25,000 prize put up by this Frenchman Raymond Orteg, who wanted to inspire travel between his homeland of Paris and his new found home of New York. And as I'm reading the book, I'm taking notes in the margins and I'm going, oh my God. There's, I'm adding it up, $400,000 spent to win this $25,000 prize. I said, how insanely leveraged is that? 16 times a prize money. And this guy didn't spend a penny to back any of the guys most likely to win. Admiral Bird, who was first person to fly to North Pole, the most likely player to win had packed large plates of China in the back of his airplane to celebrate when he landed in Paris. Now, like they wouldn't have China plates in Paris. But he crashes on takeoff and he spent $100,000 to try and win this prize. And Lindbergh, the most unlikely guy, in fact, the day before he took off from New York, New York Times on May 19, 19, 1927 wrote this editorial, it said, stop! Don't do this thing. You're going to crash and setback aviation a decade. Well, of course, just the opposite happened. Lindbergh makes the trip. He's called the Flying Fool. He goes from being the Flying Fool to a global hero, who's named most school kids still know today. And in 33 and a half hours later, he lands in Paris. Within 18 months of his trip, the number of passengers in the United States went from increased 30 fold. The number of airplanes quadruple, number of pilots tripled. This huge aviation because it was a paradigm change. Oh, if he can do it, I can do it. And so that formative moment, I said, that's what we need. Because I, at this point, again, given up on going the government route, I said, I need something to spark these private companies. And so the X prize, originally, the letter X was going to be the name of the person who put up the money. It just took me so long to find that person, the X stuck around. So I couldn't, to get to your story on leverage, I went and I pitched, you know, from Fred Smith, Richard Branson, you know, hundreds of CEOs and CMOs on this vision of this highly leveraged incentive prize. And everybody was like, this is a crazy idea. It'll never work. Someone's going to die. Why isn't NASA doing this? And everyone said, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay. How many people? Hundreds of people. Literally. It was, because at this point, we announced it under the arch in St. Louis. I had, what year is that? This is May 18th of 1996. I had this concept called this line of super credibility. There's a line of credibility. If you announce something above the line of credibility, it might happen or, might people might believe it or not, depending on what you do. There's a line of super credibility. If you announce something above the line of super credibility, no matter what you do, it's people believe it and their belief makes it happen in some sense. So I had, not one asset. I had 20 astronauts on stage. I had the head of NASA, the head of the FAA, Lindbergh family, Bert Rutan. And I'm announcing this $10 million prize. No one asked, do you have the money? We did not. Unfortunately. Do you have any teams competing? We did not. And so we started having teams register, and I'm feeling more and more on the hook to raise this $10 million prize. Because it's like, Peter, we're going to be getting there. Do you have the money yet? Well, I will. I promise you, I will. So, you know, insane pressure is the mother of invention. Not insanity. Well, this was insane pressure. And I ended up being able to raise a small amount of capital from donors in St. Louis. And a friend of mine said, have you heard about a whole one insurance policy? So what does that mean? And so, well, you take a bet and you pay a premium. And if someone accomplishes a task, they pay off the prize if they don't want to keep the premium. They're meaning the insurance company. So we put an end date on the ex-prize of January 1, 2005. So you take a bet with an insurance company? So we bet, how did you approach them? I mean, just, hey, I'm going to. So I went through Aeon as a broker who went to the space insurance underwriters. So I was sort of on capacity, traditionally ensuring launches and satellites. And they play in the very traditional world. And the insurance underwriters went and said to Boeing, you're going to compete? No, Lockheed? No, Northrop Grumman? No, no one's going to win this thing. It's ridiculous. So they took the bet. And it's not publicly disclosed how much it is, but it was in the single-digit low millions. But I didn't have $3 million to pay the insurance premium. But I thought I could raise it. So I wrote a policy where I would pay $50,000 every month with a large balloon payment at the end. So I would be paying in $50,000 last Friday of every month. And I'd have this $50,000 Friday coming. How did you finance that? Begging. Well-worn knee pad. I became very impassioned in fundraising. Our friend Adao and many of our common friends, Elon. And basically going up to folks and saying, here's the vision. And I would literally finance this thing $50,000 at a time. Because if I didn't pay the $50,000, all the money I had paid in beforehand would have been evaporated and the thing would be over. They'd keep it. So I read about one day, I had this large, you know, balloon payment coming along. I read about this woman in a new shot. I'm sorry, born in Persia, came here in high school, became a serial entrepreneur. Herner Husband started a company called Telecom Technologies. I saw the Sonus Networks for a billion dollars. And in her bio, it says, and her dream is to fly on a suborbital flight into space. And I read that thing like four or five times on a suborbital flight into space. And I committed in that moment in time to track her down and I did. And I was her first meeting when she came back vacationing from Hawaii after selling her company. And we named it the AnsariEx Prize because they put up the money to pay off the rest. And it was so successful. We've taken the ex-prize now and turned it into an incentive prize organization and we're launching a series of ex-prizes in different areas. Got it? So before you go there, so you're running all this stuff with ex-prize. What was your life like? What life? Yeah. Did you sleep? Well, I mean, it wasn't just ex-prize. We had zero G going as well. Now I want you to imagine, I had started zero G. Zero G is a parabolic flight company. I wanted to make it possible for all of you. Anybody here flown in zero G? If you raise your hand, if you have, lots of great customers. There we go. One, we have two. So we have a flight out of Moffit Field on May 25th. If anybody wants to fly, please come and join us. And so I wanted to, the next best thing, if you couldn't fly into orbit, was to go and fly on NASA's zero G. How they train the astronauts. So Byron, Lichtenberg and I, May of 93, walked into the FAA and said, we want to go and commercialize a parabolic flight. And they say, well, what's that? Well, we take in the airplane. We put 30 people in the back. We take the airplane up into a 50 degree angle of attack. We take them out of their seat belts. And we push over the top and they float around. They said, you want to do what? Go talk to our lawyers. The lawyers proceeded to explain to me that nowhere in the federal aviation regulations is this allowed. And I said, well, they weren't thinking about it 50 years ago when they wrote the federal aviation regulations. So what does that have to do with the fact that it's not allowed? And as a final result, it took me 11 years and four months to become operational. This was an 11 and a half year startup. While doing X-Prize. While doing X-Prize and launching space adventures. Now, interestingly, as we launched, 0G in May of 93. And X-Prize was conceived of in 94 and launched in 96. The X-Prize, 0G, had its first operational flight in September, third week of September of 4. And the X-Prize winning flights occurred a week later. So both of these independent things collided in my life at the exact same moment time, which was insane. And you had space adventures. Yeah. How did the idea for space adventures start? So a friend of mine, Mike Anderson. As well as the ISU. Mike McDowell and Eric Anderson, who co-founded this with me, the Russians had become a capitalist society. And the great Soviet assets were now being made available, including you could go when you could rent a MiG jet. You could go fly a MiG 29 or MiG 25. Literally, I would go to the Zikovsky Air Force Base and you'd be sitting there walking around and hopping into a MiG. And 10 years later, earlier, you would have been shot dead as being a spy on this super secret air force base with an incredible. And then you could rent there. You could actually go and fly on the Russian 0G airplane, but couldn't do it on the US. So capitalist Russia was making all these things available. And we started a company to do that. Another good friend, Richard Garriott, who you heard of Ultima online in the video game. So as a perfect example of someone following their passion, Richard's dad was a Skylab astronaut and a Shuttle astronaut. And Richard in high school became a video game designer. And literally didn't graduate, didn't go to college, but became hugely successful and has made a large amount of money that allows him to buy a private flight to orbit for $30 million. And so he is now in training in Russia and star city as our six private customer. Who are the people that went up before? Dennis Tito went up, runs wheelchair associates. We had Mark Shuttleworth for South African. We had Greg Olsen from the US, Anushan Sorry, who funded the Anastari ex-price, was our fourth. And Charles Simone, who wrote word in Excel, was our fifth. So our goal is to go from one to two to four. And basically we market the Russian Soyuz vehicle, which is still the safest vehicle on the planet. So you're doing basically space adventures, zero G, ex-price at the same time, and you realize you don't have enough to do. So you actually have the ISU going as well. So international space university was started by myself and some colleagues early on before this. It's been successful and continued. So we wanted to start a university, a graduate style university for the study space. Recognition is that opening a frontier, any frontier is multidisciplinary. It's not just engineers or scientists or financiers. It's everything. And all countries involved. We had met and become friends with R3C Clark. And we had talked about this idea of a university that would bring the best and brightest minds together for the study of space. I was a grad student at MIT and I had a Bard at MIT's campus. And we created, we had a founding conference for this international space university, which was a little bit audacious to have a founding conference for university at MIT as graduate students there. And we convinced NASA to kick in some money and a few other people again. Crazy stories. And we ended up starting a university. We have two programs, a summer program that travels every year to different place. And the 2009 program will actually be up here hosted by Ames. The 2008 program is in Spain. 2007 was in China. Yeah, pretty amazing. So are you doing anything else with your life? Well, yeah, we just started a new sport called the Rocket Racing League. Just very briefly, I went to an Indy 500 race a few years back and was bored out of my mind by the car going, boom, boom. Anyway, you get the idea. And so over beers with a friend, we decided to try and create a new sport that would be rocket-powered airplanes in the three-dimensional close course. And we're launching it this August at Ashkash. And we have a brand new generation of rocket-powered vehicles called X-Racer. You think about pod racing. And you get it. We have a virtual race wing in the sky technology. Where you see the raceway on the Jumbotron, the video screen at home or on your head-up display if you're a racer. And what is that going to be? When is it? First one. First one is last week of July this summer. So it's, you know, NASCAR is an formula racing our multi-billion dollar industries. And so, you know, how many launches launch people in the space every year? Guess. How many? Ten. It's about four to six launches of humans. How many total commercial launches are there per year to space? 100,000. It's about 12 to 14 in a good year for commercial launches into space. How many commercial companies are there launching satellites into space? About 12 to 16 commercial. So imagine one customer per year for these companies. I mean, it's not a good business. So it hit, you know, so one of the things that hit me was that there's a much better marketplace. I call them self-loading carbon payloads, you know, humans. They're easy to make. They come with their own money. There's lots of them out there. So that's the, you guys are slow. Anyway, it's the tourism industry. And so the rocket racing league is about having thousands of rocket firings and flowing technology from the rocket racers. Just the way the same way, formula in IndyCar technology is flowing with cars that we drive with paddle-shifting ABS brakes. I hope that the rocket racing will drive new technologies. So you think people are going to be watching for the excitement or for the accidents? Yeah, they say that people go to cockroach races to watch the cockroach crashes. Anyway, we'll see. It's going to be, I mean, imagine half dozen of these vehicles spewing 12-foot flames, you know, racing against each other. It's going to be incredible. And it is. I've seen, we just did the series of test flights in the vehicle at the Mojave Desert recently. And it's amazing. And do you have people to pilot? Yeah, we have. Oh, kidding. It's huge, huge interest levels. And how do you filter who's going to be a pilot versus it? You have to buy a team. Yeah. And then, you know, they will go through a training. But it's, there's a whole video game component where kids can, each of these vehicles have a differential GPS and they'll transmit it. You can race against these vehicles in real time at home. So it's going to be... And that's the summer. That's, this summer, the first, we do the first public flights of these vehicles. Yeah. And the first race will be... We'll do a series of exhibition flights to the end of this year. And then we'll do the first races in 09. And then we're going to tell us. We have a whole television side of the equation. So, you know, just on the, on the critical side, right? These are very, very audacious programs. All of them. It's seen. Do, do people ever question you about the potential risk to the people involved, people in the grounds? Yes, and, and I had, I was, I was in a congressional hearing. And one of the Congresswoman stood up and said, Dr. Diamandis, aren't you, in fact, going to cause people to kill themselves as they go after this ex-price? And I was really taken aback by the question. And I thought for a moment, and I answered her the following way. I said, 500 years ago, thousands of people gave their lives as they crossed the Atlantic to open up this great nation. You know, 200 years ago, thousands gave their lives again as they crossed the Great Plains to open up the West. And you're telling me, on the verge of the greatest human exploration ever, people should risk their lives, that's un-American. And she didn't follow up with any further questions. But it's true. You know, if you stop and you think about it, the greatest, you know, to have true breakthroughs, require taking risk. You know, I think we're killing ourselves in this country by our inability to take risk. You know, the day before something is truly a breakthrough, it's a crazy idea. If it's not a crazy idea, then it's a small, conventional improvement. It's not a true breakthrough. So how do we incentivize really risky stuff? It used to be in the government programs. I mean, for God's sake, you know, saying in 1961 that we're going to the moon after we had not even sent anybody to orbit yet, we had just put Alan Shepherd up on a suburb orbital flight. The medical journals, if you go back and you read the late 50s and the early 60s, late 50s, didn't know how the human body physiology would react to space. Would the brain work in the, you know, Van Allen belts? Because it's basically a electromagnetic machine. Could you even swallow in zero gravity? Now, you know, the fact of the matter, anybody who's ever watched someone drink a beer while standing on their head would be able to know that you can swallow in zero G. But they asked these questions. And so this audaciousness of this, and I want to share a metric with all of you to really empower you in something. The average age of the engineers in 1961 who designed the Apollo program invented the propulsion and navigation and guidance, the structures, the rendezvous and docking system, the average age was 26. The average age of the engineers who designed the Apollo program was 26 years old. Because there was no one there to tell them what couldn't be done. It was literally at the peak of their creativity. These people were given a clean sheet and said go and make this happen. You have a presidential mandate and they did. The same average age as, you know, who created the dot com revolution. So to the faculty in the room, next time someone in their mid 20s comes to you with a crazy idea, listen. To the students in the room, if you have a crazy idea and someone tells you it's a crazy idea, well, maybe it is for them. Go and do it. So literally, there's a way of thinking and we have to take risk. Got it. So, so X-Prize, where is it going now? How are you basically incorporating risk taking into X-Prize? The mission of X-Prize has expanded quite a bit. So what is X-Prize now? Where is it going? We set a mission when the X-Prize was originally one, we ended with $0 in the bank and we asked the question, do we wrap up and say, tana, success. Very tough, but not. So we ended up thinking about do we become a technology play of incentivizing space exploration. We do X-Prize. We set a mission after a deliberation to use X-Prize as incentivized breakthroughs or range of areas. So our mission is to bring about radical breakthroughs for the benefit of humanity. The goal is to incentivize maverick thinkers to set audacious but achievable goals. So that's really where we try and focus our points. What does the public think is literally impossible until it's done. And that's where we try and put a large cash prize to change behavior. So one of the X-Prize is going to be how to create a new US government? That is not. We have five verticals. We have exploration. So we've launched since then the Google Lunar X Prize. It's Google's put up $30 million in prize money for the first private team to land a robot on the surface of the moon, row 500 meters, send back a series of photos and videos. Now originally NASA was going to fund this prize. Remember I said earlier there was this company called Blast Off that I moved across the country to go and do with Ideal Lab. Well it was basically to do this private moon mission and then we had the dot com meltdown and the money vaporized so that never happened. So this is the way of fulfilling that original vision of a private moon mission. So we've offered it through a prize mechanism now. So NASA was going to do this but they couldn't find $20 million in their budget. They were going to make it US only so Google stepped up with $30 million in global competition and NASA was sure that no one would register to compete or we'd have a small handful. We've had over 700 registrations from 50 countries around the world. 700 registration requests. So a huge amount of interest. We're working on a series of deep ocean X-Prizes to map the other 97% of the ocean floor. In life sciences we've launched the Archon X Prize for Genomics, sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days. We're working with Lance Armstrong on a cancer X Prize. We are working on a human longevity X Prize. Double or triple the healthy human lifespan. Energy and the environment. We've launched the automotive, the progressive automotive X Prize for a new generation of cars that exceed 100 miles per gallon equivalent, manufacturable, desirable, low carbon emissions and working in education and global development. So we're experimenting where these prizes will work. And how are you financing them and staffing the prizes and what do you need help? So we're financing them through corporate sponsorships and private philanthropic donations. For me, out to pitch this as a new form of philanthropy. People work huge, tense to make their money in life. And they demand tenfold, a hundredfold leverage on their dollar while they're making their money. And then when they go and give it away, they're happy on 25 cents in the dollar. And prizes are a very efficient way to get ten or fifty times your money and you only pay the winner. You know, I don't care where someone's gone to school, what they've ever done. You know, if they win this thing, they get the money. Not for trying, not for good idea. So we are, you know, I have my email up here. We do have summer interns and we staff it really. Each of the prizes is staffed with someone who's passionate in that area as I was about space. Okay, so you're not up to a lot of stuff. So where do you go after you do all these prizes? I mean, does this become a perpetual machine of creativity for people to get involved with and for society to get involved with? It's basically an alternate channel to finance. It is an alternate channel to finance and drive breakthroughs. I think a presentation in September up here for the Long Nile Foundation and I'm thinking about the concept of mega ex prizes. So I want you to imagine it's the year 1870 and someone were to say, you know, that we'll bring up a prize for a heavy than air travel or instantaneous communication across the Atlantic or unleashing the power of the nucleus. I mean, these things would have been inconceivable in the late 1800s. But yet many of them were right around the corner with Marconi and the Wright brothers. So what do we think is totally impossible today that is only only 20 or 30 years from now? And what can we incentivize with that? So we're thinking about those areas and our goal is to launch two or three of these ex prizes per year. Amazing, amazing. So at this point, I really want to open up the conversation to everyone in the audience and encourage you to ask questions to Peter. So anyone have any questions? Come on. Thank you. Yes. So incredibly, working with some folks, El Sequel and Dave Gallo, and we have got a great advisory board from Jim Cameron and Sylvia Earl and lots of the people in the under-ocean. Three percent of the ocean floor has been mapped. And we've discovered literally the greatest mountain ranges, the biggest waterfalls, underground lakes. We think that biogenesis, the formation of life, of all life was erased on Earth. You'd probably have biogenesis in the deep ocean thermal vents. So we are over the next year going to decide what the deep ocean ex prizes should be. Should they be for the design of technology, swarm robotics, technical and cooperatively map the ocean floor should be for new human technology. We're still using the Russian mirror submersibles from 30 years ago to go down deep. Should be for ocean health. We're going to find that out. But we want to, the oceanographic community is stuck, much the same way the space industry was stuck. Peter, first thank you. This is very, it's wonderful to actually see how you first of here and actually make the space space. So you talked about being passionate about space travel, but a lot of what you actually did involved fundraising. So could you talk about just kind of what was it like to basically going to do fundraising for this and what some of the lessons you learned to do? Sure. Yeah, so just so we could hear the question was about fundraising and the lessons learned from fundraising because it was such a nannical part of exprez and everything you did. So it is probably one of the most critical skills that you can learn. I think of fundraising as energy transfer. It's going to someone and convincing them to give you some energy that you can go use to go and accomplish something. And I had a formative moment in my life, my sophomore, yeah, my sophomore year at MIT, I had started my first organization ever as called SEDS, students with exploration and development of space and you know become a global student space organization. And I started the first chapter at MIT and I needed $5,000 to print a newsletter and mail it out. And I went to DARPA to Draper Labs and I met with the head of Draper and I knew they were profitable, they were nonprofit, they had money and I was pitching up my heart out, you know, would you please I need just $5,000 and he says I'm sorry we're nonprofit, we cannot to give money. You know what you're doing is great. So I was walking out the door and I stopped and I said well, could you instead print my newsletter, she said sure, we've got all printing facility here, I said would you mail them? They said absolutely. We probably got about $25,000 with a printing and mailing from Draper over the years, that year and the following years. And it hit me that there is, whenever you go and you ask some, first of all you have to ask, the first rule of sales is you have to ask, you have to believe in yourself and what you're doing passionately enough that you're willing to give this person the opportunity to help you or to be involved. And then you have to ask and then you have to commit yourself, I'm not going to walk away from having invested that time without something. It may simply be why aren't you investing, what advice do you have for me to go and on my next call? Who can you introduce me to that does want to do this? And I think other thing I learned, I sage a fellow, our curth taught me in my early days exprised, you said when you ask for money you'll get advice and when you ask for advice you might get money. And that stuck with me a long time. So I used to be extraordinarily impatient. Hello, what's your name? You give me some money please? And I learned that that's not necessarily the best way people, when people invest in you or in your project, they're investing in you. It's a transfer of confidence. So you really need to build a relationship with that person in a way that they touch their heart, they understand why you care about this, how it relates to them and then they will naturally want to get involved. But I can't emphasize enough how important that is in a skill, if you want to go and do something, it's about convincing other people to join you, bring their technology, bring their money, have George investing your company. Yeah, it's amazingly true. Because we see it with entrepreneurs, some of the best entrepreneurs in the fundraising process, the fundraising is secondary to wanting to get groups of people involved. They don't show up and say the calculation of how much money you're going to make is 4.7x over three years. They don't do that. And a lot of people ask me and other venture people, how do you decide to fund something? What is the critical amount, what is the critical entrepreneur return? I'm like, there is none. And some people say, well, how can there be none? I was like, well, we like to think, can we return 10 times the invested capital? But the reason why I say 10 times is really because the way we qualified in our heads is, can this generate a sufficient breakout? They were proud of our association and it could also make money. But 10x is really just a qualifier. It's not really mathematical in the sense, and that always puzzles people. But it's actually the truth. You said it the best that have anyone ever heard. So more questions, please. In the back, actually. How did you plan to make sure that a lot of technology and innovation that's generated through the prices is actually going to be shared? So let's say you have a prize for somebody to come up with energy efficient cars. And somebody would surprise, maybe the number two and three had great ideas. Are you going to have a way to share so that other groups, students and universities can learn from that and evolve those ideas? It's a great point. So Peter, I'm just going to repeat the question for everyone who may not be able to hear you. The question was, how do you share the information and knowledge that gets created in these prizes with a greater group of people to encourage more creativity across a greater group? So first of all, one rule of thumb is that the team owns intellectual property. We don't lay a claim on that. So it's important that they have it to be able to go and develop it further. Take it to market. The prizes cause an instigation. They hopefully change a public paradigm and then the marketplace will hopefully take it from there once there's a proof of concept. One of the things that we do is we our job is to promote the teams to the maximum extent possible. Make them into heroes, which means we're in constant discussions with television networks about behind the scenes. Following that, we are focused on helping the teams promote themselves to the industry. There will be a huge amount of money invested in these teams and they will be aggressive. For example, the unsari ex-prize teams of the 26 teams from seven countries about eight or nine were real and those real ones are ongoing industry companies right now. One of the things that we're looking to do in this is an area that if there's expertise in the room here, I would love to have you come forward. We're looking to create something called my ex-prize, which will be an online platform where groups will be able to get together and create a prize concept for the local community. Or if there is a thin community around the world with rare disease, for example, group together and set a set of prize rules. And literally at the lower levels, $1,000 to $1,000,000 create these prizes and make an efficient marketplace for problems and problem solvers. Next question, please. Right over here. Can you tell a little more about your green car ex-prize, the 100 miles, the gamma ex-prize. How was it funded? What's the year? We have something called the progressive automotive ex-prize and progressive insurance. Peter Lewis and Glenn Renwick have committed the prize money. It's $10 million per person, initially. You'll hopefully grow from there. You have to build a car that can get 100 mile per gallon or it's equivalent. And we worked with the EPA to create equivalency scale for the total carbon used to create that energy. So whether it's hydrogen, methane, electric, it's got to be cars that can be used on the roads today. We're not interested in theoretical cars. These are cars that can actually go into production. They've got to be manufacturable. They have to go through a number of gates to demonstrate the manufacturability. And they have to be affordable, meaning they have to be at a price point where they could sell $10,000 or more per year. And they're well-known metrics there. They have to get less than, I think, it's 200 grams per mile of carbon emission. And we have over 70 teams that have signed a letter of intent program. There are two categories, a three-wheel two-seat, called the alternative class for inner city, and the four-seat four-wheel mainstream class. Next question, please, sir, please. Yeah, can you discuss how a price process compares to other financial leveraging processes as far as how it affects the one-can-influence to regulatory systems? Absolutely. Great question. So prizes have a way of driving regulation in their wake. So the example was it's late 2003. I'm pretty sure that someone's going to be making a shot for the UnSariEx Prize in 2004, because the prize purse was over in 2005, and I was hoping someone was going to make a shot for it. But the rules and regulations to allow private human spaceflight in the United States don't exist. This is a problem. So I went and met with Marion Blakey, then FAA administrator, amazing woman, also the same woman who allowed 0G to become operational after 11 years. And obviously a risk taker and a very incredibly smart, an brilliant orator. And I said, Marion, the ex-prize is going to be one outside the United States because rules and regulations don't exist here. And very quickly, that concept sunk in, and the rules and regulations were passed in the next few months. I think you can have with global competitions and a rooting reflex from the public the ability to create a forcing function to drive regulations. Sorry, but we'll have to skip you because there'll be two from you. Very fascinating. Could you compare your foundation with say, kind of any foundation or form foundation? Sure. So traditional philanthropy says, I like what you're doing. I'm going to invest and give you money to go and accomplish it. And it's very much like traditional venture capital. You don't know everybody in the world working on this area. You're typically betting on a single individual with limited knowledge of the arena. And you're funding them, open loop, maybe with a limit on how much money you're willing to invest, hoping that they'll accomplish the goal. But without knowledge that you may get there. And you're, you know, it sometimes works, it sometimes doesn't work. And it's an important part of the equation. The x-prize says the opposite. It says, I'm putting up the prize money. And I'm going to only pay the winner. So it's very efficient. You don't pay anyone who tries. You only pay the person who accomplishes it. And typically you will have 10 fold. So the unsurrying x-prize that a 10 fold increase, $10 million spent on the purse, $100 million spent by the teams. Or take prize was a 16 fold. The Kramer prize was about a 40 fold. Historically you have 10 to 40 x amount of money spent by folks like Paul Allen, or if you imagine if Larry Ellison spent money on winning, competing for a prize versus, and he does for the America's Cup, which is a zero cash, that's infinite. But for a prize that had a social goal or purpose at the end of it. So it's a way of attracting capital to leverage your philanthropic dollars. So for me, I'm out there now speaking to the Carnegie's and the Gates foundations and saying, incentive prizes should be a tool in your portfolio mix. And to pick a number, I say 10% of all the money you give away should be in the form of prizes. Grace Wetcher. So I have sort of a combined question for both of you. It seems like to a certain extent, if you're not providing the money to the teams up front, then it sort of selects for the demographics of the teams, whether or not it's more. So I wanted to ask you what the demographics of the teams usually are. They're more corporate based. And also whether or not, as I was also going to ask George, whether or not he's seen anybody include the ex-prize in sort of potential revenue and evaluation. So it's your first. I had this incredible experience. I walked in my office. I was in the late 90s. I was office in St. Louis, the St. Louis Science Center, who is a provider of C-Capital. I had this package on my desk, really thick package from Romania. I'm going, I don't know anybody in Romania. And I opened it up. And it was a team registration package from a bunch of graduate students at a university in Romania. And I was like, holy, I'm pulling out these photos and these designs. And they're building these kick-ass rockets in the middle of Romania. And they were funding it as graduate students by jobs and whatever they could do. And they formed, they are now, 10 years later, the leading aerospace company in Romania. And they've also just registered to compete for the Google Lunar X Prize as a Romanian team. So I was just amazed at how a prize can be a positive agent. So I'll give you an example. Before the X Prize was around in the earlier 90s, someone going to George looking for funding for her or her rocket ship. So George, would you invest in my rocket ship? I'm going to give people rides on suborbital flights to space and say, hold it. Regulations don't exist. There's technology risk. You might kill somebody. I think I'll invest in tea bills instead. And that was traditionally the response. No one was investing in this thing. Now we created this prize. And the approach went something like, would you back my team from Toronto? I want to beat the team in Montreal. And almost on the whole sports financing model of regional competitions. Or it's the US versus Russia. Or it's this sponsorship that didn't care whether you succeeded or not, but how much publicity you would get. So we literally were able to tap for the teams part of the $20 billion sponsorship market. That wasn't possible before. Yeah, I'm to answer your question. No one's put on in their presentation or summary that winning the X Prize or an X Prize or any kind of prize could be a source of funding. It actually hasn't popped up. And if I have any issue or concern, a lot of the plans and summaries that people send me are really very evolutionary versus revolutionary plans. A lot of, I think I'd much rather read things that are breakout possibilities versus yet another internet music site. I'll have to talk to you later about this idea. So next question. Great to hear. Okay. So one thing I just am working in long term, but is that there's an extremely small number of people who invest in these areas. It's probably one of the most important areas that might be like that. There are not market enabled mechanisms to support things that have benefits out of fives. That can't prove across a wide spectrum of things. There's people like Paul Allen, Peter Tiel, and I hear Divers. So we're doing some things that's still very small. What do you think are the core reasons for that? And how do we change that? Well, long term plan to be becomes much more supportive. So the idea of incentive prizes is an old idea. It was the Longitude Prize in the early 1700s put up by the British Royalty. And then what was the Longitude Prize? So the Longitude Prize, it turned out that in the 1700s you could know your latitude very well, but you could know your longitude. And many of the British fleets were crashing on the rocks. And thousands of people were losing their lives. And so the Royal Society of England put up a prize, 10,000 pounds, or thereabouts if everybody remembers the exact number. But for the person who could tell Longitude. And the concept, when something was described to be hard, it was described to be as hard as determining one's Longitude. It was sort of a phrase that they had in that time. And it was won by John Harris, a watchmaker. It was thought to have been, they didn't want to award the prize to watchmaker because it wasn't the technology they expected to win the prize. But to your point, in the turn of the century aviation prizes were very much the norm. And there were hundreds aviation prizes. What changed that was World War II. When all of a sudden it no longer became, people needed innovation on date certain. We've got to beat the Germans in the war. And consequently you'd throw money at something versus do allow Darwinian evolution to evolve something that's better in New York. So what I'm trying to do, and I think we see that now, maybe you saw that Peter put a million dollar prize a couple days ago for an artificial chicken meat. So I think we're going to see prizes become more and more into play. I had a chance to speak with the founder of CRV Rick Burns, who told me that in the early days of creating Charles R. Raventures, the idea of a venture capital fund was a strange idea. You have to go around person in person and sell it over and over again. It finally eventually caught on. So hopefully, you know, X prize and incentive prizes will be similar. Arthur C. Clark said there are three phases of a good idea. The first phase is people say it's crazy. You'll never work. The next phase is it might work. It's just not worth doing. And the third phase is when they tell you, you know, I tell you it was a great idea all along. So we're entering that third phase now. Yeah. Thank you, Peter. Thank you, George. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
