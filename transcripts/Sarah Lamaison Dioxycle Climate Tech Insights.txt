 This is the Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders Series brought to you by Stanford Equal. Welcome everyone to Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders, the Stanford Seminar for aspiring entrepreneurs. ETL is presented by STVP, the Stanford Engineering Entrepreneurship Center and Bases, the Business Association for Stanford Entrepreneurial Students. I'm Anthony Ruth, I'm the Director of Strategic Communications at STVP and today I have the pleasure of welcoming Sarah Lemason to ETL. Sarah is the co-founder and CEO of Diet Cycle which is pioneering sustainable chemistry by building breakthrough technologies that convert industrial carbon emissions into everyday chemicals with unprecedented energy and cost savings. In 2021, Sarah received the L'Oreal UNESCO French Young Talent Award for her research and CO2 conversion and received the French National ILAB Innovation Prize with her teammate Dr. David Wakerly. She was selected as a breakthrough energy innovation fellow and that was in 2021 and featured in the Forbes 30 under 30 list in 2023. Sarah also holds a bachelor's from A.C.O. Polytechnique in France and a master's from the University of Cambridge and she carried out doctoral and post-doctoral studies between Stanford and college to France. Everyone please join me in welcoming Sarah. Well hi everyone it's a great pleasure to be here and as it was said I'm fortunately pleased to be here after spending two years here in between like 2019 and 2020 which were like really amazing research shares with Michael Fondreth David so yeah very very excited to be discussing what we have been doing so so far and so today my goal is for you to live with like free takeaways. So first an overview of L'Ido Carbon Utilization Field and high level vision of the different technologies and approaches. Again on overview of what we are doing in that field at Diet Cycle and finally some learnings gathered in the making from myself as a researcher transitioning to a climatic entrepreneur. So yeah so first what is carbon capture and utilization and why does it matter? So as you know we do need to drastically reduce our carbon emissions and remove CO2 actually from the atmosphere to stay way way below the two degrees Celsius trajectory. And so here as you see in the background the the striped the stripes the color stripe represent the level the atmospheric level of CO2 that have been going from 280 ppm in the 1800s pre-industrial area to right now 420 ppm which is far above the 350 ppm level where you start to have adverse climate impacts and all these greenhouse gases effects. And so one question some of you might have here if you're familiar with the question of like climate change is why I have I put like two degrees C's as a target and not 1.5 degrees C which was the the target set by the Paris Agreement in 2015. And the reason is I mean quite sad and simple it's because we've I mean there's actually an open debate right now on whether we can still reach the 1.5 degrees C's because like we have been too slow already over the past years at reducing our carbon emissions and so it's really a question of now trying to limit this global warming to 1.7 1.8 degrees C's which is already going to be a challenge. And so you know how do we intellect that trajectory how do we reach net zero by 2050. Well I have a good news which is the fact that the first answer to climate change is so ready and it's like each of us who can have an impact you and me by changing our daily behavior and you know reducing the frequency of our flights eating less meat and doing different things like this. And so this is this 5% is the projection of emission reduction we can target by 2050 by just sobriety. And so just to give you a few order of magnitude today an average the average carbon footprint of an American is between 15 and 20 ton of CO2 per year. And so we emit equally one ton of CO2 when we do one round trip light between New York City and San Francisco when we eat twice a week a steak beef steak all of that four year or when we commute 15 miles per day to work for one year. And so by changing any of these behavior by cutting down any of these we can actually already diminish by 6% our personal carbon footprint and of course even more if we do all these different things. The second the second pass we have to reduce these emissions is through the massive deployment of existing technologies like electrification for industrial usage for example the deployment of the use of a heat pump in your house or like the electrification as you as you know that the sorry the development of renewable energy developing solar or windmill. And so again to give you a few order of magnitude by upgrading a house with a heat pump you can save up to 8 ton of CO2. So quite significant again if you compare that to the carbon footprint of an American or if we shift now to 100% renewable our own electricity personal electricity consumption we can save up to 4 tons of CO2 per I mean per year. And the last the last thing and here is actually a picture of one of our lab we have two labs one in France in Paris and one in Menlo Park and the last the last one the last option is by using technology that are currently still under development. And so of course we need to deploy massive research to to to deploy this technology so that they meet these 45% reduction target by 2050. And so as I said like these these new technologies are going to be needed to cut down the emission of what is what are called heartwavid sectors which are the industries that are really difficult to decarbonize that you cannot electrify easily etc. And so these heartwavid sectors include the following cement steel and aluminum aviation chemicals every road and shipping. And so for example the the reason why steel is hard to decarbonize is that is because in steel making the first step of the process is actually the conversion of iron ore into iron. And so to do that you basically need to pull out an oxidant from your iron ore and the way it's done right now it's in big blast furnaces where you have a reducing gas such as carbon monoxide that is produced from coal in situ that is going to pull out this oxidant from your iron ore to just leave behind the metal iron. And so you're converting your iron ore into iron but in turn you're emitting one molecule of CO2. And so it's very difficult to decarbonize because now like you're I mean you have to really change the full process if you want to stop emitting this CO2 molecule which means reinvesting a lot of catbex and really changing your infrastructure. And so basically the way we are going to decarbonize these different industries is either by developing completely new processes and so it's done in steel right now I mean there are a lot of project going on to replace these carbon monoxide reducing gas by hydrogen or by deploying sort of ad hoc solution which is like for example carbon capture utilization and storage also referred to as CCUS. And so in carbon capture utilization and storage what happens is that you have a first step of capture. So you're going to capture either like your emission on the point source. So as I was talking about like for steel you would capture the CO2 emissions and it's very concentrated emission so it's kind of like energy efficient or you have another pass where you're now capturing CO2 directly from the air of course it's much more diluted as a stream and so it's much harder to do in terms of energy consumption. Once you have your your carbon emission your CO2 you're going to transport that either through pipeline or through ship and you have two options either you're going to store it underground in geological formation on shore or offshore or you can utilize it. And so if we zoom in on the utilization well there are many things you can do with utilization. So these are all the different all the all the blue items here. And so the first thing you can do which is the oldest way of using CO2 is using it as is. So basically you just take your CO2 molecule and you do something with it as is. And so the first thing the most obvious thing that you can do is use it for food and beverage beverages for example to make your soda sparkling. Then there are industrial use it use of it such as an oil recovering recovery where you're basically pumping CO2 down depleted oil field to push more oil out of it and hopefully leave the CO2 in there. It's quite a controversial use of course but it's not it's not the topic today. And so like apart from using it as is you can also convert it. And so in terms of conversion the less I mean the use that requires the less energy is by mineralizing it. So you're basically going to convert your gases here to in a mineralized form and this is often like useful to make additional building material. And if you're now like willing to do some product that is a bit upgraded you can go to synthetic fuel but of course it's going to consume more energy or finally you can convert that into into chemicals. And so now if we zoom in again on the chemicals it's actually very interesting and carbon utilization is particularly suited for the chemical industry to reinvent the chemical industry which is the industry of carbon. You know right now you can't make textile fiber plastics windows frame without without carbon it's a question of matter you know. So that's that's really where carbon utilization makes a lot of sense reinventing a carbon cycle where you source like sustainably your carbon in order to invent everyday product. And so on on the I mean what is interesting about that and a good way to phrase it and hopefully you can remember that is you know the chemical industry cannot be decarbonized because it's the industry of carbon but it can be def fossilized. And by this what we mean is that you know when you look at today's in 2020 the source of carbon in the the world's chemical production you see that 85% of this carbon is coming from a fossil source. We can there's a lot of studies that say that you know by 2050 we could completely displace that proportion of fossil source of carbon with sustainable sources of carbon and really reach a world where you know you carbon come from either recycled plastic or material but also carbon emission derived carbon and bio based I mean biomass derived carbon. And so if we now zoom in again on this thing and and and and really div dive on how we can make a sustainable a sustainable chemical whether the the the way to look at it is very simple. You just have to think about what is a chemical. A chemical is basically a long carbon based molecule I mean a carbon based molecule that is filled with energy and so understand where your energy come from you understand how you can make a chemical and a sustainable chemical if your energy is sustainable. And so on this graph basically on this diagram I've represented just different sources of energy to make this chemical. So on light in light green you see biomass fermentation here your energy source is your biomass it's already filled filled with energy and so you're you can just basically take that biomass and further upgrade it to a chemical. Then on the dark purple you have the hydrogen technology. Here the energy source you're using is hydrogen and so you're basically gonna use hydrogen combined with CO2 carbon emission in an hydrogen reaction reactor sometime with some heat some pressure and you're gonna really use that energy carrier that is hydrogen to re-energize your carbon emission and convert it back into a chemical. And so on the on the dark green diagram you have this is biological processes so here again you can take carbon emissions but this time you're gonna basically use bugs that are capable of sourcing their energy into like sort of metabolic energy source it can be a sugar it can be anything in their environment they're capable of digesting and with that energy they are gonna be able again to convert your carbon emission into a chemical. And finally when your source of energy is electricity well your your presence of electrolysis and so that's basically what we do at dioxycle so we develop breakthrough electrolysis technology to convert carbon emission using just renewable energy into sustainable feedstocks and in particular chemicals. So I think by now you've you've understood that society does need to reduce carbon emission and and still needs to produce cost effective chemical and so that's what we are focused on with a big emphasis on the cost effectiveness of the process because you know if you really want to trigger a fast adoption of a technology you have to align economic incentive with the environmental incentive or at least that's what we strongly believe at a second. And so the way we position ourselves is that we we provide a solution to help carbon emitters decarbonize their their process cost effectively by basically helping them to reduce their emission while profiting from the sustainable chemical they are producing. In other I mean another way to present it is that we deploy this solution on site modular solution on site where we are going to capture the emission and convert this emission into low carbon chemicals. And again the big emphasis on what we are doing is that we are bringing this technology with a no or negative green premium which is cost competitively versus fossil whereas all the current sustainable alternatives for this process have a green premium which is an over at cost compare to the fossil cost of your chemical which is the thing. And so we start as I said with ethylene which is the most produced organic chemical in the world used in textile fibers in PVC in PE polyethylene piping plastic packaging for you know many many different usage. And because of the size of the ethylene market and the carbon footprint of the ethylene making process by displacing the way we are making ethylene we can actually cut the equivalent of 1% of the well-dimission and look at a 170 billion dollar opportunity. So it's really like an untapped environmental and economic opportunity and the reason it's untapped is because it's I mean there's a huge barrier to entry technological barrier to entry to actually do that cost effective. So our team I mean we were introduced before but David and I we co-founded the companies in January 2021 after five years of academic research between College of France, Cambridge and Stanford and now we bring together 20 people some of them are in the room from 10 nationalities comprising 70% PhD because as I said the biggest barrier to entry is technological and we operate from two sites in Paris and Millow Park and so in terms of funding we've raised 26 million to date, latest from being our series A led by breakthrough energy ventures and lower carbon capital and with the participation of gigascale capital and we were very lucky to be part of the breakthrough energy fellowship before and so how does it work? So how does it work? So basically we developed this novel type of low temperature carbon and electrolyzer where we feed in carbon emissions water and these are going to be exposed to what we call catalytic core which are like active surface areas which are going to be able to convert this carbon emission into the product, the main product, ethylene and some byproduct using electricity and so each catalytic core comprises three elements an anode that is doing an oxidation separated by membrane from a cathode doing a reduction and so after we piled them we piled this individual cells onto the one another in between these metallic plates that are called bipolar plates and the role of the bipolar plates is to funnel the reactant in and the product out of of this stack and so what's I mean what's unique about us apart from the the product we are making in the electrolysis field is that we innovate at all level since day one we had a very integrated approach innovated on the component level developing high energy efficiency gallists superlocose membranes at the system level by developing novel stack design which are extremely energy efficient and reach high yields and a software layer also like continuously improving the operation of the stack and finally we also innovate at the industrial level by developing integration schemes to really make sure we integrate this technology within existing processes so that we minimize the overall cost and we also valorize 20 assets which are like the industrial assets you have you have on these plants and so by doing that we are the really the first one to put forward value the following value proposition which is like producing sustainable ethylene at fossil ethylene price and so if you remember my my little diagram from before if you want to produce sustainable ethylene again you have these different these four different pathways based on the way you're feeding I mean you're you're bringing the energy to to make your final molecule but as you see none of them whether it's like biomass from biomass from hydrogenation or from biological process I mean none of them right now is cost competitive with fossil they all suffer from a green premium and on you know by contrast we we come in with like a value proposition of no or negative green premium which again we believe is going to be key to trigger large adoption and so I mean this is again a huge opportunity in terms of like environmental impact and economic impact because right now ethylene is made through steam cracking of fossil fossil feedstock whether it's NAFTA or ethane and the carbon the carbon footprint is that of that process is between 0.9 and 1.7 ton of CO2 per ton of ethylene instead not only you know by using our process not only we cut down this this process emissions but we also are going to now you know take some other carbon source from another emission and embed it into the ethylene so that the net difference between this process and the and the fossil process is between like three and five tons of CO2 per ton of ethylene we produced depending on the carbon footprint of our electricity and so in terms of like total carbon impact potential given that the ethylene production in the world is around 200 million ton I mean you do the math it's somewhere around 700 million tons of CO2 per year that can be displaced which is over 1% of the world's emission for over 1% of the world's emission so that's what we do and so now in terms of like the the the learnings I just wanted to give you like a kind of unpollished unpollished some unpollished opinions about the the traps to avoid when you're when you're studying a climate take startup so you know I I was there before like you finishing my academic studies and you know the goal is to I mean what is success when when you're starting a climate take startup success is developing a company that is capable of cutting million tons of CO2 per year so you know that's that's the definition of success and so there's a lot of things that can happen along the way and yeah again these are my opinions so I think the the first trap that we can fall into you know when you when you come out from school is that you think you you know a lot of things because you went to a top school and so I'm I'm saying that laughing because you know it's actually a good thing sometimes to to to to be very confident when you don't know a lot your industry because sometimes you probably wouldn't take the risk of starting a company if you knew like how hard it is later and how little you actually knew back then about everything that was waiting for you so I would say that was the that is kind of the the first trap that can that can happen and so my advice for this would be to always keep an underdog mindset and by this I mean don't assume that academic knowledge is real life knowledge although it's very powerful very important to have it there's so many other dimension in the I mean in the rest of the world to optimize for and that are needed to develop I mean to have a successful career and to do something meaningful that I think it's it's really important to keep this gross mindset and keep asking for advice all the time early on a second thing I I have perhaps for people joining companies early on especially in startups is don't care too much about the title you know I mean there's always a lot of like inflation around titles but actually what really matters I believe is like the team you work with and you know the mission and like how much you believe the team you're working with is capable of delivering on that mission so I think that's really that's really important and the third thing I would say that is also probably quite controversial about about salary especially if there are MBA in the room I have heard they were trained to like negotiate their salaries it's too not too negotiate too much like salaries at the beginning but instead like getting the company over deliver and then negotiate because we you know as a as a as a founder I see that a lot of people in the company when when they're in and they're delivering they're so good at what they do like you really don't want to lose them and then they have much more leverage to actually like really ask for for something and you know if if you negotiate too early I would say that it's a missed opportunity for some startup where you know they they perhaps don't have a lot of resources at the beginning so they want to make sure they don't take too much risks in terms of like hiring and so yeah I think I think that's an interesting way to look at to look about it the second trap I think especially when you're a technical founder is to start your company not talking to client until your product is ready and and so you know like in that case I think you know you can get in the the trap of you know working on your own to perfect the tech for a lot of years and actually going in in the wrong direct wrong direction spending a lot of resources and actually doing something that doesn't answer any need and so my advice for that would be to just like start talking to clients and have this like very nice cycle where you talk to client you make sure there's an actual need for what you're doing then you you look at technology as a mean to get there and really as a mean to develop a product and then you know based on that you get some contracts or a letter of of intense early on that allows you to to raise funds and attract talents to have more resources to develop your technology and so as a resource you're you're improving your product and scaling it up and you and you go again you go back see your client as there is this time your product is answering their needs and you improve based on that so that was for the second trap the third the third trap and again I think quite controversial as you know you've done all these things now you've talked to all these clients you've started pitching this to a lot of venture capital and now you like you like talking too much and you lose sight of what you're here for and so I think it's important to remind that you know climate tech needs much more science than talk and by this I mean you know it's not a it's not a type of industry where like making an ipod where like the idea of the product itself is quite genius like here the the problem and the need to solve is quite obvious like we have to reduce a carbon emission industrial players are happy to do so but they need something cost competitive that's quite simple and the question is who can do it like cost efficiently energy so that they will adopt that at a at a price that is competitive with what they used to do before so this is I think quite important and I would say you know based on that the main thing if you want to work in that field to do is to really get technical and by this I don't mean just scientifically technical just like knowing your industry understanding your industry understanding even how like sales are done in your industry but like really understanding your industry from like a process perspective etc and so I think that you know in climate tech it's pretty obvious but technical breakthrough are the main unfair advantages you know you're always asked oh what is your unfair advantages and in climate tech I I have hard time thinking of any other like any other unfair advantage other than than a technical one so that you have something that just is is actually better the second one I mean the second thing also is you I mean you see that when you talk to to VCs and you talk to clients a working pilot you know is much more convincing than a slide so it's also why I think really like trying to deliver technically very fast is really important and yeah and so that's that's really important and so to be again a bit a bit boring but I think in terms of like thinking about thinking about a career being mission driven when you really think about it what does it mean I think it's to it's to really apply your your skills where they're the most valuable and so perhaps it doesn't mean founding a company and perhaps it's it means like joining a company that is actually already answering I mean working on the on the topic you're working on when we started the company the cycle there was one company in the US I mean most of what was done was in the US in America there was nothing in Europe we wanted to start something in Europe and so we're like okay perhaps we do have to start on our own but you know like we really ask ourselves is there another force we can join to help before before sending a company because there's a you know because there's a lot of hype around climatic and I think we I mean it shouldn't be because it's not it's it's not really cool it's it's just hard and it needs to happen so we really have to make sure we allocate the resource where we're there in Becful and then so once you've done all this I think one of the traps you can face is you don't ask yourself the the hard questions so now now the problem is you know if you're a technical founders a founder in particular you have a technology you've been working on for five years you really like it it's you think it's really great and you know you really you really want to push this technology and I think you have to make sure you don't blindly hang on to this technology and instead actually analyze it compare it benchmark it and perhaps even change it if you need to change it and I'm saying that not likely and you know at the beginning we started with with David a worker on CO2 to CO so conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide which is a precursor for jet fuel and so like we really push the like the performance of the technology to top level we weren't like we really delivered on the different milestone we have set for ourselves and at the end of the day we did the we did the math we did the techno economics and even then with the best like best performance possible we we realized you know perhaps it wasn't it wasn't like so better than other options that people would actually take the scalar prisk and pay for that scalar prisk and so at that point in the time which was very early on we were like okay let's go back to the drawing board and we looked at the different products we could make and we decided to go to ETHLEEN which is a much higher added value product harder to make but we were like if there's a play it's there it's where it's hard where no other technology can can can have a I mean can deliver on that and so I think that's really really important and not only you have to like coldly look at your like own technology block but you also have to coldly look at the full process and make sure you look at the full process when you think about our technology electrolysis so you're converting you know you're you're making a product but it's like mixed with unreacted unreacted carbon emission and so you know there's there's always a question of you know you want to separate this this unreacted reactant from the product and so there's a balance for example to strive between the yield of your reaction and the separation cost at the end and so you want to really make sure you're analyzing your full process and not just focusing on optimizing one thing in the middle so that at the end you're really optimizing for industrially relevant metrics and so I would say if you're a scientist perhaps bringing a process engineer and early on so that someone is really like telling you about the balance of plant which is you know all the auxiliary systems that are around a central technology so so now you've made all this thing you've you've bet on the right technology it's it's it's working but you know you've made the analysis of the process and you realize it's a bit it's still a bit expensive and so one of the tribe you can fall in right now is to think that people will actually pay more for sustainable alternative and they will probably do if it's like for you know like a customer product that is very high-end but like most of these products they have tiny markets and so you're not going to have a big common impact by addressing a tiny market and so like the mistake is when you're like oh I'm going to make gasoline or if you'll and it's going to cost like four times the price of fossil fuel and it's going to be fine because people are going to pay forever the fact is you know perhaps the government is going to subsidize for a while but at some point the most energy efficient and cost efficient technology will have to win and you better be on the side of like the most efficient technology or I've started doing something else at that point and I think this we can kind of summarize by this this sort of diagram where you know you have on one side the goodwill and there is goodwill in the world that's great and you know climate philanthropies are in this category and it's really important the work they are doing but you have I mean I think it's really important but that's my opinion to see business as a separate category and not try and mix these two categories and see really climate tech businesses in the business categories where you really have to have like economic performance in addition to your to your like sustainability performance and I think the dangerous zone is in the middle you know and it's it's when people assume you're going to have large long-term green premium which is like people paying much more a long time and so that's I mean I was saying for a sustainable aviation fuel for example well we really need to take these the cost of making them down because I mean now we're going to subsidize them forever what is going to happen that's a that's a good question of course if there's a price on carbon then your your non-sustatable alternative goes up in price and so now you have a possibility of saying it's cost competitive but we have to make sure that your your actually answering the the right I mean making the equation work and so yeah and so now you've done all this you have actually a business you I mean you're sure that if your technology is working then then the the economic incentive will be aligned and then you have another trap that you can still fall into is that deep down you know you realize this technology won't scale for example so you know on the lab bench it's working and if if everything scaled then it would be working and it would be like viable but actually it doesn't scale and then like one of the problem is if you don't give up and if you keep going and I think there's a cool citation quote from Phil Knight the creator of a Nike who said sometimes you have to give up sometimes knowing when to give up when to try something else is genius and I think it's true especially in a climate take where we really need the people I mean we really need the talents to be funneled to the to the to the technologies that scale so that we meet our our emission reduction goals and so you know thinking about that I've I've thought about like this sort of framework of what are the good reasons to quit and what are the bad sorry what are the good reasons to keep going with a take or a business idea and what are the bad reasons to keep going so I think the good reasons to keep going are first this technology is fundamentally sound like you know life fusion like it's it's going to be very hard but you know it can work and it's incredible what it can do and it just like it just can work fundamentally then the economics can work soonish or you know or you have a plan to really back that up for a long time in terms of like funding and finally you haven't tried everything it's not working yet but you haven't tried everything and so there's still hope and perhaps you know you're one experiment away from from nailing it down so these are the good reasons and not the bad reasons to keep going are probably like first in line the sunkost you've invested so much energy that you can't let it go like it's like five years of your life and you're like oh my god like if I stop doing that what am I going to do and it's it's a terrible reason because like I mean the cost in the future are so much higher compared to the ones you've already paid for then you told the other it will work so now you you don't really want to you know admit it won't work or even worse you told yourself it would work and you don't even admit to yourself it would work so I think these are these are the thing with Dave early on we've kind of made a promise that if you know one day we stopped believing that we could make this work we would just stop and you know go work with a with a company that you know had a better better idea like simply said and like you know that we would kind of watch out for one another egos getting in the way of actually doing something good you know reasonable time scale so so now it's okay so you've best all this you still think it's it's gonna work and there's a final trap which is you know it can work it's fundamentally sound etc but now you lose face because you're tired you're really tired you know it's possible but nothing nothing is working in the lab and you don't know why and yeah and so there's a I mean a friend of my entrepreneur Sebastian Boyer gave me a good a good image to think about that which is like the curse of complex systems so you know you have to imagine your system when you're working on a complex technology as a sort of series of components and they are all in series and as you know in a from your electricity curses when when one thing is not working then the series line is not working and so here on this graph you basically represent the probability of a system comprising n component of working based on the probability of one component working and so you see that when you have one component n equal one it's very easy I mean there's a I mean it's one I mean it's linear of course but then as you increase the number of components there are more and more probability that the series of component won't work at a given probability of one component working and so you end up when you have a lot of components to you end up by having like a very long portion you know I mean a very long time where where your system is not working although you like incrementing incrementally optimizing each of your components and you have to really reach a threshold where you know above that threshold above that probability of working of one component the series starts working and I think that's a I mean that's a very important thing and we had that a lot also at I mean at the beginning I mean we still have systems that don't work and you know you you you test one hypothesis you think it's not like you think the result is negative but it's actually kind of a false negative because there's still something else that is not working and yeah and that's yeah that's really hard and the answer to that is to keep keep pushing and actually there's a second part to that quote of fill-night when he says sometimes you have to give up sometimes knowing when to give up when to try something else is genius which is giving up doesn't mean stopping don't even stop and that's the answer to the last rep thank you. Hi thank you so much for coming I'm curious what are your thoughts on a public private partnership and have you explored private partners like Generate Capital which is a public benefit corporation that turns technology projects into infrastructure so customers don't have to take risks they don't want to take or spend money they don't have to for reference Generate Capital operates the electric batteries on Stanford's very own margarit buses circling campus right now. Yeah so sorry I'm not familiar with Generate but well I would say like public I mean if you're mentioning a party public funding I think it's really important to bring in like both public and and private capital especially for like first of their kind pilots I mean for example there's a you know a program for energy catalysts that fund first of their kind large plants and so it allows to de-rescapart of these of these plants for the for the industrial partner who is like co-funding the rest I mean it's not really public because it's a private institution but it's like philanthropic money so yeah that would be my answer I'm not sure I'm replying I'm sorry so for the audience I know a little bit but if you were to frame your journey as you talked about starting an academia where you are now is a pre-commercial commercial on that spectrum of where are you on the journey of really generating revenue as a company. Questions so we are pre-commercial we do generate some revenues for life visibility study and really early like cost of our engagement but so the goal of our series is to do our first industrial pilot so that's that's happening now. Hello Sarah thank you so much for your talk I think it was very inspiring hearing kind of your journey and then all the traps that we can fall into as founders I had kind of two questions what do you mean by being technical do mean like pursuing a PhD in academia or spending like 20 years in industry and then my other question which you kind of touched on is do you believe that most people innovating in the climate tech space have to be coming from very like research heavy background or other other ways in terms of like innovating business models or finding different paths to value yeah yeah great so yeah when I say technical you know that I didn't say get scientific because I was actually on purpose not trying not to say like do a PhD that's the only way together it's more like know your industry really well like you know really understand like I mean spend a lot of time in industry I think it's a good idea like first you know especially on on chemical chemical engineering stuff you know you probably want to have done some process engineering somewhere chemical engineering to understand how it works which we didn't but you know so early on we were like okay we have to hire a process engineer we have to hire someone who is very good at stacks we have to do all these things so I mean get technical in the sense that spend a lot of time really making sure you have all these skills in your team if you don't have them yourself I would say though like I think it's really hard to hire people who are very very technical if you're not yourself like have a lot of really like pitching them something very strong so yeah any knowledge you can acquire is really good then you have other like version where I mean other routes where you can start climate I mean businesses which have a climate impact which are a bit less technology heavy but that's you know that's a different story and here it's more like you you get started if you have a great idea and that's easy I forgot your second question I'm so sorry always more you can't touch on it but I'm most like climate innovation based on like research and acting like in innovations or is it having to like successful climate success we're like the software space like hard markets or other like the innovative like business model yeah I mean there's a lot of cool stuff to do in in the software industry as well then it's just it's just I think it's I mean carbon accounting for example is very crowded I think as a space so yeah I mean I've seen a lot of things that works very well like watershed or things like like these kind of companies are great it's very different I'm just saying you know like a lot of the things we need is also very I mean very industrial unfortunately it represents a lot of the like in terms of proportional of the emissions it's a lot so we probably need a lot of people to kind of sacrifice and go in there you know thank you all right you guys that is the end of today's session please give Sarah round of applause the entrepreneurial thought leader series is a Stanford E-Corner original production to learn more please visit us at ecorner.stanford.edu
