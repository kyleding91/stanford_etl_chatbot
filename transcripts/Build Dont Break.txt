 Who you are defines how you built. This is the OddPattern thought-leaders series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. On this episode, we're joined by Hemath Tanesha, managing partner at the Venture Capital firm General Catalyst. Here's host and Stanford professor Tom Biers. Today, I'm really delighted. I mean, generally delighted that I get to spend this time with Hemath. He's the managing director at General Catalyst. He also is an author and I recommend all of his publications. One of them in 2018, we're going to talk a little bit about today. It's called Unscaled and it was regarding the need for accountability and transparency and explainability in AI technologies. Then there's a piece that is heavily influencing me as we work on this ethics and entrepreneurship project. And it's the piece that the Harvard Business Review article in 2019 called the era of move fast and bright things is over. So we'll talk a little bit about that today. But in addition, let me just talk about what he does in his spare time besides writing books and being a world class venture capitalist. He's co-founder of the Advanced Energy Economy and organization focus on transforming energy policy in America. He's the founding board member of the Khan Lab School, nonprofit K-12 School dedicated to classroom innovation. And he sits on the board of fellows right here at Stanford University and their school and the school of medicine. He also, and this is really makes me happy to share, that he teaches a terrific computer science course, not this year because his partner is on sabbatical. But next year, so for the Stanford students listening, listening, get ready for this. If you have room in your schedule next year, it's called Artificial Intelligence, Entrepreneurship and Society in the 21st Century and Beyond. So welcome, I'm on how you doing. Thanks for having me, Tom. Well, you, and I noticed that you already on the Q&A, some folks, I've noticed something that I didn't mention, five degrees from MIT. Okay, smarty pants. What were they in? I'm testing you. Do you remember what you got five degrees in? Yeah. Well, it was computer science and electrical engineering, mathematics, biology, operations, research, which was a master's in the master's in computer science. Okay. I think in a history of 20 years of doing ETL, which is 24 speakers a year or so, that means 500 speakers, you might have more degrees than anybody we were in. Tom, it's not a market of intellect, it's a market of ADHD, which is why I'm a venture capitalist. Why did you get all the degrees? You just enjoyed school so much. You know, honestly, my favorite thing to do in undergrad, and I know the sounds, the little geek you were looking at the course catalog and just seeing all the things that were available. And MIT, like Sanford, is a very interdisciplinary place. And I just, for the first few years, took all the classes that I thought were interesting and then started deciding, what am I going to graduate in towards the end of my journey there? And then there were a few departments that I could have finished. So I loaded up and tried to finish whatever I could. So it was not planned. It was more curiosity driven. Well, then it sort of perplexed. You got out in 1999 and around the time of the infamous dot com period in technology. Why did you want to become a venture capitalist? Why did you become a venture capitalist capitalist? Yeah. It's sort of interesting. I was really in a doctoral program and my goal was to be a professor. And I mean, you remember this well in the late 90s, it was this unbelievable time where on campus, all these faculty and students were starting to build businesses with the rival dinner and ad. And it just felt like it was a moment in time I wanted to be a part of. And took a couple of my grad school friends who were some of my best friends and we decided, hey, let's go build a business. And really it was to be part of that moment. I used to joke my life's a bit of a greedy algorithm. This is the most interesting thing going on right now. So I'm just going to go participate in it. And we just jumped ship. So one day I was an academic and the next day I was trying to figure out what does it mean to actually start a company. So you made your way to become a venture capitalist short with there after? Yeah, so that's right. So I built a business for about three and a half four years, was terrible at it. Learned how difficult it is, which frankly helped me get empathy for what it means to be an entrepreneur. And that's always stuck with me because I struggled so much. And we sold that business, which was in the mobile infrastructure arena. And at that point, General Catalyst was just starting and they invited me to be an entrepreneur in residence. So I actually sort of said, hey, I had my four year gig, made lots of mistakes. I want to do it again. And I'll go sit with this new firm and try to be an entrepreneur in residence. So I actually never really thought I was going to be a VC. It just somehow, you know, certainly, put us we happened. Yeah. And you have been since then, including coming out West 10 years ago to start the GC office, which is right downtown, everybody right on University Avenue. But when's the last time you're in the office? Boy, last week. Yeah. And our CHRFON, no, I'm not supposed to do that. I've not gone there since. Yeah, well, it's a cool old home. And so folks, when you come to visit again someday or live here, you should check it out down on University Avenue, right downtown. But how has the industry changed over 20 years, you know, from the time you joined to now, I'm talking about the venture capital industry. I think a lot about that. It has materially changed. So when I think about when I got into business, all of our effort was on how software can fundamentally bring efficiency to our life, right? What's better software for doctors, what's better software for teachers, supply chain managers, what consumers on the internet. And you fast forward today, we're actually redesigning all the corporalers of society, right? We're actually building new healthcare services, we're building new insurance companies, we're building new schools, all, you know, digitally powered. So what does that mean? That means we've gone from efficiency to efficacy in terms of the value proposition of the companies that we're building. The second thing is we've gone from being a technology vendor to actually redesigning these core services in society. So if technology was 1% of the budget that we were serving for these markets 20 years ago, we're going after the entire 100% of the budget. What does that mean? Well, a billion dollar wind used to be amazing in the early 2000s and now you're actually seeing 100 billion dollar companies being built. So everything has changed in terms of the size and scope of the ideas and therefore the responsibility that we have and how we manifest those ideas. Well, I'm looking forward to diving deeper into that. Is it one story of one of your portfolio companies or companies you could have hand in investing in or being on the board and nurturing them that illustrate that? Would that stripe be that, for example? Yeah, I think the one I would give you is actually, maybe because I'm spending so much time in healthcare right now, it would be a live on go. Right? We're building a live on go is not part of teleduck and we can go into that story later, but we're actually building a service that helps 32 million consumers in the United States that have diabetes and other comorbidities. We essentially help them manage their health conditions and live normally. That is different from giving them an app that they could use to collect data and then go see their doctor and get care. Right? So it's a fundamentally different mindset of how do you approach the problems now? Yeah, well, I want to talk about Lovango if you don't come back to that because it was a heck of a story over the last year and you had a ringside C from my understanding and still involved in the company. Anyway, we'll come back. But you know what, I'm going to get ahead of what is very typical when we have a venture capitalist in this series over the years. And that is what about students who are considering a career in it? And you know, can you give some advice to that? Yeah, look, it's a really interesting way to spend time. And you can think about this. First of all, sort of why do it? You can think of why it is. It's a career for going and doing financial transactions and deals. Before you can think about it as it's a great vehicle for creating impact in the world and society that you care about and sort of focusing on enabling entrepreneurs that are working on those kinds of problems. So like is this sort of a certain dipitus, you know, you're selling money, not the sound crash, or is this sort of a vehicle for intentionally going and creating change in the world? So I would just say given the evolution of our role as a technology diaspora and we're trying to do in this digital transformation, intentionality matters. So going it for the right reason, I suppose is my first comment. The second is it is a very competitive industry because so much, and you see this in stock market today, technology stocks are highly overvalued and everything else is highly undervalued, generally speaking. It's because so much value is occurring to technology like businesses. And so a lot of capital is coming in which means capital gets further commoditized. So you have to think about what are you going to develop as your core skills, so the entrepreneurs want to work with you. And I generally believe having gone and done real work building companies gives you empathy for the problem and off entrepreneurship. And so I think that's one piece of advice in the second again is become an expert at something. So I'm going to get into it, get into it with a point of view and I can say this from my personal experience, it took me a long time to figure out how to do this and I failed a lot. And so you do need to have patience and perseverance if you are going to get into this. That's a very important trait because you can't really learn, there's a lot to learn to get this right. Well, thanks for sharing your thoughts on that. Let's go back to Lavango because it's one of the sectors you've been investing and in fact, in typical, Hey Mont style, you wrote a book called Unhealthcare, a manifesto for health assurance. So first of all, I want to know what you mean by health assurance. That's a cool term, but I love that. But then would you tell the story of Lavango and tell it out, please? Yeah. Well, I'll take this to the reverse order because Lavango led to the creation of the health assurance thesis. So there's a phenomenological in order from Chicago, Glenn Tolman. And he, this is 2012, I'm just going to tell you a little story of how the company came about. He was going to retire from his previous company, which was above the company and essentially invest out of his family office. So I invited him to the valley. And I set up eight, I think it was eight or nine speed dating meetings with a bunch of technology founders doing health care in my office in Palo Alto. And at the end of the day, we went to dinner and Glenn and his typical very polite midwestern style said, him on terrific founders, but I got to tell you, none of these companies are going to work. And I actually said exactly right. And the reason is because these companies are technology first in their culture. And they actually don't understand that health care is not a free market and don't have empathy for the problem as well, because these are folks that have really not been in the health care space. And my, the reason I did that is I was basically making the patient on him, don't retire. Let's team up because we can culturally build something that's going to be at the intersection of technology and health care, a true partnership. And that is what it's going to take if we want to transform the health care space. And then we drew up on a white board, what segment we're going to go after. We decided on diabetes because it was personal to him, his son had diabetes and others. And so he has sort of seen the pain for his 10. And we, from first principles, decided the goal there is going to be twofold. We want to transform the consumer experience because we think about life of the diabetic. It used to be your checking year block glucose every day, your writing, the data points are constantly thinking about it in the background. And then you go see your PCP four times a year with that data to see how you're doing well. By the way, the reality is if you were okay that day to go see your PCP, you were probably doing that well that day. In the middle of those two visits, you might have gone to the ER because of some Caesar. This is a real time. It needs to be a real time managed as opposed to being checked on four times a year. So we decided how about we give consumers an experience where they can disengage from the disease, not think about it all the time. And if something was trending wrong, we will be monitoring in the cloud and we'll call them. So they can have their peace of mind. So that was first, which is transforming the consumer experience. The second was we didn't actually analysis and in diabetes, consumers with diabetes and other conditions cost the health care system about $350 billion. And we said, we're going to take $100 billion out of this market by keeping people health here, by assuring their health. So our health care thesis essentially was about how we transformed the consumer experience to make it more preemptive, but with a real commitment to shrinking the size of this market, which is very anti-capitalistic. Right? When you mentioned Striper, the striped missions to increase the GDP of the internet, the mission in our health care work is to actually reduce the GDP of health care. Because this is a drain on society and when it reduced the costs, so folks have resources for other things. So that's how we started building company and honestly taking that point of view and putting the consumer in the middle would build something that grew as fast as any of the other businesses. We started in 2013. We ended up going public in 2019. And then last year, we decided to combine Livongo with Teladoc in an 18 and a half million dollar merger. The reason being we wanted to take the two winning platforms, put them together and build a modern virtual health system that could truly transform as a platform, as opposed to these two companies competing and killing each other. Well, that's the brief story of Livongo. Well, it's going to be fun to track Teladoc because that is the public company, correct? Absolutely. And it certainly seems it has unlimited potential and will be one of those companies you were talking about earlier. Absolutely. Long time ago, I'm going to run the ahead of that. Yeah, wow. But I'd like to talk about the themes of your course that I mentioned that you're teaching artificial intelligence, entrepreneurship and society. I remember when you were thinking about doing that and I came by and we talked about where would be a good place for it in terms of I think CS is a great department. And who's your partner teaching that? Syria Gangeloop. Yeah, yeah. And I've just heard amazing things. When will you do it again in the fall? Probably in the fall. Yeah. All right. Awesome. Awesome, then. But that seems to be an investment thesis though of your firm. So and you know, you wrote the book in scale. You touched on earlier, but anything you want to share about AI technologies? Yeah. So I think the observation that we started to make in the early parallel decade was boy, we're going from those companies that are building software to make stakeholders more efficient to building new health systems and new education systems and new new banks and what not, right? And why was that happening? And the reason that was happening was because by having platforms like Facebook, Amazon Web Services, iPhone, we had essentially started to have a way to organize content, community, commerce, now care online. And they the act of doing that essentially became these closed loop product development exercises because you could rent all aspects of scale that you needed. You could rent computing, you can rent manufacturing, distribution, consumer access. And so it all became about mass personalization. So if in the 20th century, we had scaled all of our systems, corporations, banks, power plants, hospitals, we were now starting to go from that mass production and mass scaling to mass personalization. So managing your diabetes or teaching you in a personalized way on Khan Academy or giving you your own kind of a financial management surface online. So that's the trend that started to happen. Why was that possible? It was because we could have an implicit understanding of the consumer and their needs and have this product development loops. Well guess what? That is, you know, you went from it, if you remember, big data to machine learning to AI over the last 15 years, you started building this deep intelligence around people. And the thing we started observing is well, those product development tactics were okay when you were building games and you were trying to influence people's engagement in games. But when you start doing that around healthcare, somebody's health, you can't, to your point earlier, move fast and break things. If you're teaching somebody, you can't just experiment with different features to see, will they learn better or not? And actually, it's somebody's educational journey. You can't play with that. And so how do you do that responsibly? That is what we started thinking about in the context of AI. I think AI is not a thing by itself to go invest in a lot of companies and just like mobile is the thing. But using, how you use AI and how are you accountable, transparent and explainable in your approaches, became a core focus for us. Because that's what it is going to take to build responsible companies. And that is what led us to writing that book and putting our frameworks out there around it. You certainly inspired me. As you well know, I've told you this a few times now in our work at the Center, the STBP Center that puts on this series to rethink what we mean when we say entrepreneurship and innovation. And we have, you know, this, this Center puts on the series. It also is the home of Steve Blank and all his lean startup courses and movement. And to a person across our 24 faculty full time and part time faculty agree with you. You know, and whether we stand up new courses that are specifically about ethics, not mentorship or about responsible tech, it's embedded now in every core, other course, including this one. I mean, this is a course, as you know, but it happens to be divided through. So it's really great to have you because you're in way, you're sort of a godparent to it all with that piece you did in 2019, the era of move fast and break things is over. We all know that to be the theme of Facebook and its first ten or so years. Anybody Facebook call you about that title? No, no, no, I listen. It's not like they don't see it. The thing that's interesting is, you know, Facebook is a very profound company to organize society and community online. It's the unintended consequences is they did not know what they were getting into. And by the way, this happened to us 150 years ago. Like if we were staring at the first internal combustion engine today and somebody told us, hey, this is going to transform society, but it's going to cause climate change, how would we have used that differently? It's the same thing with the use of AI in trying to garner people's attention and building products to a facility that it led to, you know, there's lots now been said about that. I don't need to go into it, but that was just an unintended consequence. And so to me, learning from that to say, how do you build companies now when the scalability of these companies is very fast because you've got Moore's Law and Metcass Law working behind these companies. You can go touch hundreds of millions of people within a couple years. Well, as you better understand the unintended consequences of they become untenable very, very fast. To me, that's the big learning there as opposed to thinking that, you know, there were bad intentions. None of these founders, you know, that we meet start with those bad intentions. You just, you, you, you, you, you, you, you lit into it by the series of decisions that you make along the way. Well, as you saw last year, you know, you were so kind to also come to a conference we put together with University of St. Thomas and Duke University. And you saw that educators have gotten a message and it's being emphasized not just, I'm not just blowing Stanford's horn, but it's really across MIT. And all our peers, all the full spectrum of colleges are now emphasizing. There's a entrepreneurship and innovation are very powerful tools. I know you agree on that. You know, you've dedicated your life to that. You know, to combine with these technology, these technology paradigm shifts. But the only kind we're doing is principle, you know, ethics, based, values, based, responsible, technology, innovation, all that. And it's, they've become a little bit of buzzwords, but that's okay. It's released. It's in the conversation. So in the piece for Harvard Business Review, you said there are eight questions that folks should ask. And I think you were speaking even to your VC community, you know, with that very directly saying, these are the kind of questions more or less saying, look, this is what we're asking. Can you pick a couple of those eight? Because I do encourage you to go read that HBR piece. It's free on their site. But what are those two? Well, how about this one? You wrote it probably three years ago. Those two seem even more important today. You know, I can say you can bucket those questions into two things, mindset and mechanisms, right? And the mindset of the stakeholders that are working on the company and that includes, you know, the founders, the product development team, the investors, everybody. Are they thinking enough about the systemic change they're about to go create? Right? Do they really understand all the stakeholders that are involved that they touch, right? And not sort of immediately, but second order and third order effects of as well as their business? So that just brings intentionality to the whole body work. And one example of mechanism is, are you looking for the unintended consequences that might be emerging from your innovation? So this goes back to what I have called algorithmic canaries. Are you measuring the second and total effects of your products on society? Because every time the challenge is around how do you make the right short term decisions for your business that are fundamentally aligned with the long term interests of society? So I think having that bigger picture and having that kind of a product development mindset probably had two important ones that you have to think about. Yeah, well, there was also one of those eight that, you know, in 2018, you had probably no idea just how important it was going to become now because it was important then it just got a lot more attention and that is DEI. Absolutely. You know, those statistics in 2018 were pretty horrible. And so I encourage everybody to go have a look at that. But you're really ahead of the game on that too, calling out the industry. It's a great point because one of the unintended consequences always is around equity. And are you really building for society as a whole or are you empowering some stakeholders and leaving others behind? Listen, that happened with the internet, right? If you think about how our rural education and healthcare have suffered, digitization benefited the urban areas more than rural, you know, that, I mean, this is something that we have to worry about with biology. I'm sort of using this notion of biological divide. Well, if Chris Brick and help us, you know, become an NBA players or NBA candidates for our kids, is it going to be an affordability issue? And does it cause equity issue? So just constantly thinking about are we taking care of all those stakeholders with these innovations? Is there responsibility we can no longer ignore? Has the technology diaspora? Well, let's get to Q&A about that. Let's trust the up voting system. We got one here at the top. How about taking that one? And healthcare ventures like Lavango and other sectors that have significant gatekeeping, licensing requirements, regulation stuff like that. How do you approach introducing novel business models, which is a customer first model that may not easily be accepted in that existing system? It is such a great question. And the business models that are in these industries have a lot to do with, you know, where they end up. So advertising is a misaligned business model, right? Who pays and who benefits our two different stakeholders? Healthcare is even worse. Who pays, who benefits, who decides our different stakeholders often? So one of the things we have always thought about a lot is where are those leverage points in the system where there's alignment of those stakeholders. So when we started Lavango, for example, we went to these self-insured employers because they were taking their own risk. And we could go to them and say, here is the clinical ROI. Here's the improvement in lifestyle of your employees. And here's the financial savings. So if you make that decision, do you benefit across the board in using the service? And so I think the key is to find these leverage points where there is alignment for even if it's a small sliver of the overall market, demonstrate success. And if you have shown economic as well as in this case, clinical benefits, others will follow. And this is exactly what happened there. And that has become a little bit of a play look in this industry because I meet lots of companies out there, Lavango for X, where X is a persona, if Lavango was serving for diabetics. And I think just that leverage point identification is really, really important. Thank you. Let's do. We'll take a look here. We got one, we got one upvoted here. Let's go. When and why should a startup receive VC funding? Let's get to basics. What do you think is the most misunderstood? What do you think is most misunderstood regarding how the public and early stage entrepreneur, whoop, it's jumping around here. Entrepreneurs perceive the role and relationship VCs have in their investments. I like that. I'd like to hear your philosophies about that. Yeah. Look, I mean, I can tell you when I raised Capital From Own company, I was 23 years old and it was very intimidating because here's these folks that show up and they've got millions of dollars and that number was just daunting to even think about. And you start to immediately think about this subservient relationship to them. And that's clearly not the model that leads to success. I think the thing I have learned over the years is the relationship and I'm speaking about early stage. And early stage investor with their founders truly has to be a partnership where they're not investing with a mindset of judging. They're investing with a mindset of building. When a company is really raw, it's actually not about governance. You can have more meetings, but what governance is there to do? Because there's problems everywhere. Everything has to be figured out in the early days. So the mindset has to be, what are the key decisions that need to be made? How do we help you make them? How do we help eliminate failure modes? So it really needs to be a builder's mindset early on. And if I'm starting a company, if I'm somebody in the audience doing that, I would really be screening for that. I would really be looking for exactly how you would work with the Capital Investor. And if you're not going to get that, then you want somebody passive. So you can decouple Capital from advice and go seek advisors in the market that maybe you can help people to business. So it's got to be one of those as opposed to necessarily adding too much governance tax in the early days. Well, sort of keep it on this venture thing. I see we've got one pretty. Why don't you take that one? You say the top one there. How do you differentiate your venture capital from from others? Do you have any thoughts on the future of venture capital and any trends it might be gravitating towards? Yeah. It's a good question. The secret in our business is everybody's selling money, which is the ultimate commodity. Right? So I think the differentiation does have to go back to this idea of are you coming in to be a long-term partner and a company builder or not? Are framing for how we're different is we very much have a maker's mentality. We very much have this mindset of let's help you build enduring businesses. Our mission is actually to invest in powerful positive change that endures. And the general view is let's not look for exit strategies. Let's look for endurance strategies. We want to partner with folks that want their companies to be their life's work and we want to be on that journey. That means we want to be a capital provider all the way from beginning to health businesses in the earth through the public markets. We want to provide governance through the different phases. Again, from being just sort of co-creators and builders in the beginning to what is the take to run a public company with good governance and sort of talk about that with the right phasing. And it's all about that life cycle relationship. So that's how we think about this. I would say there are a few great firms that have that kind of a mindset towards building enduring companies in the valley. We're not alone. And it comes from also being intentional about capital we have aggregated, which is from long-term investors. They want us to do that. So every stakeholder is aligned from the standpoint of building enduring companies. Thanks for that. We have more. Here's one. You need to believe that technology will become more regularly. You seem to believe. On trauma glasses. Believe that technology is going to become more regulated. Do you think this will lead to lower VC returns in general? What are the other areas that have high potential? Internet 90s, early 2000s that we've talked about, but are not as regulated like it? Yeah, I look at the role of technology companies is changing. I'm going to keep going back to this from building free market efficiency software to actually building core services. A lot of them are regulated. Stripe is an regulated business. It's a very regulated business. But they're obviously building a phenomenal platform for commerce and financial technology and financial products that's arguably the best private company out there today. And Livanga was regulated. It was taking care of people's lives. Robinhood is regulated. So I actually think most innovation in this phase, as we're reorganizing societies, at the intersection of technology, capital and policy, and great systemic thinkers that have deep regard for the spirit of why the policies were what they were and help evolve that towards these new consumer experiences, where some of the biggest ideas lie. Because those markets are very big. So we're actually not afraid of going into regulated markets. We're building, we're involved in a phenomenal defense contractor, highly regulated space. They're doing amazing things. I mean, industry after industry, I think we have figured out how to build businesses at that intersection. How about a little bit of a right turn or 90 degree turn? One of the things that news nowadays or spacks. Yeah. And they sort of burst onto the scene. So I picked in this question because I teach a course starting in two or three weeks with Trevor Lloyd on entrepreneurial finance. It's a full course for the quarter. What do I need to know about spacks? Yeah. First of all, how do you feel about them? Yeah, time you probably don't know this, but I raised a public vehicle as well. It's actually a different kind of a security and we call it sale. It stands for stakeholder aligned initial listing. So here's a model runs back. Model runs back says, you go to public market investors as somebody who's raising a spack. You essentially convince them you've got a thesis. You're going to go find a private company and bring it to the public markets and you will take a, what I call a broker's fee for getting that deal done. And that's obviously deluded to the company. And for public market investors, it's a great way to get early access to good public companies. That'd be the idea. Okay. Good public companies have many choices and they can go public on their own as well. Anyways. What happens generally is because in my opinion, there's an economic, there's an economic impact on the startups generally companies that aren't as public right here. The ones that are choosing to go the spack route and accessing public market. So if you look at how many spacks have been raised, it is an incredible amount of money that have gone into those vehicles. And I'm pretty sure there aren't that many very good companies that are going to choose that route. And I think there's an adverse election problem that the spacks have to deal with. So imagine taking something out of the peak of the market today and you get your 20% promote as the spack enabler. But the market collapses. You still got paid, but the investor is actually lost money. There's a very likely chance that could happen to a lot of companies. So the security we created, the sale actually does away with the promote. The idea is to not get paid anything upfront and take all your fee structure, almost like a carried interest in terms of how public markets, in terms of how you stock appreciates in the public market from there. So that's a more aligned structure for everybody. And so we're trying to encourage the market to think about it that way. And in that case, if you can actually bring great operating expertise to these companies, perhaps the really good companies that are also choose to go public that way. And that's an experimental journey we're on. But I definitely can tell you, it's the volume of spack activity is crazy, and it's mind-boggling. Well, I'm going to give you the opportunity to sort through these and see if there's one you'd like to answer because we've got a lot of them and we're coming up on the end of our time together. So yeah, so here's the question. I should have founder who would spend a lot of time on a problem dealing with the rational advice from a hands-on VC in the early stages when it's contradicting the founders got. I think this is the, I chose that question because it gets to the heart of the problem of hey, we're coming to help you build. But I think the key point is we're not coming here to run your company. So one of the things that I always talk about when I meet founders in terms of our own approach, the approach is to be adaptive. And if our time is not useful, we want to apply it. If our time is useful, we have all the time in the world to be helpful. And I think as a good founder, you ultimately have to listen to your own gut. As many patterns as we have seen, all great companies have their unique trajectories. And so, you know, I think you have to listen to your venture capitalist advice, assuming they're well informed and they're self-aware to only give advice when they're well informed. I should, I should caveat by saying that. But in the end, you have to make the call. I'm actually very afraid if a founder changes their opinion because of something I said. And I want to make sure it's for the right reasons. So in the end, you have to trust your own judgment after listening with first principles. Thanks. How about this one? What advice would you give to minority and international students currently in college? Yeah. It's a great question. I think twofold. One is I do believe, and maybe I'm an optimist, but I think many firms are taking this issue very seriously around creating a more equitable environment for entrepreneurship. So that's one, which is, you know, start to understand where teams and cultures are developing and spend time there. And you can see early signs of how these teams are evolving in different firms. The other thing I would say is the opportunity is very global now. And if you are going to think about starting a business, think back to where you're from. This is about the international part of the comment, because there are great ideas to execute and the ability to execute everywhere now. I think the pandemic was an accelerant, but more importantly, you know, as everything is going digital, you know, all countries, societies are getting more sophisticated by using technology. So the number of ideas is just phenomenal. So you know, you will have great empathy for problems back there. And think about applying that empathy to resolving them as opposed to necessarily, you know, thinking about what might be interesting and high on the valley. That would be my sort of other piece of advice there. Well, since you are a part-time professor, which I hope someday you are a full-time professor, and we're lucky enough to have your talent at Stanford when you hang up your VC hat. There's something that you wanted to share today that we didn't get to, either with my questions or the student questions. I mean, because I've got one more for you. I'm going to take advantage of that in a moment, but I just wanted to double check. Yeah, look, I said, four years ago, five years ago, that we're in this 30-year cycle. Okay? And what is 30 or 40, I don't know, but the duration is long. And that applies to, you know, probably the rest of my career. And it applies to a huge part of everybody's career that's listening as well. We're in this phenomenal time. And I really do think we're all going to look back as the builders and innovators, which is a huge part of the community at Stanford. And I feel like our legacy is part of the society that exists on the other side of the cycle. This digital transformation is once in a hundred years. And so we should all feel very fortunate that we are actually living in such a fertile time in terms of what can be done with our skills, I would say, as innovators, entrepreneurs, investors in technology. And we should also feel there's great amount of responsibility. And I think that comes, you know, folks that are asked and for the fact that there's so much being taught around responsible innovation, just learning from that and bringing that to bear at all levels in these companies. If we're going in prepared with that mindset, then those engineering decisions that manifest sometimes that themselves at scale will be the right ones and will build these products are a good for society. It's truly global. You know, I want to make, I want to combine that. My question for you, you just answer, which is, you know, if you've got one piece of advice for students, these opportunities are global like never before. I mean, it's the best of times, worst of times, right? We've got these existential crises going on. And all these shocks last year, every way you turned, has provided a reminder to us, you know, in our wall, you would normally be at Stanford over in the video auditorium, you know, right out there, right outside is where our center is, the STBP puts all the stuff on. You've been by there. And there's a big motto on the wall, the bigger the problem, the bigger the opportunity. And so we have that great. Now we have this, just this awakening in all these different dimensions by this generation of students. I'm saying this is not just the Stanford students. Yes, they've been learning how to teach students in the UAE. And then last week I was teaching students in the, the, in Saudi Arabia. And it's, it's just remarkable how flat the world really is, you know, at a barrow that old term. It really is flat. And it just got flatter, you know, over the last year, but that was coming anyway. As you said, it was an accelerant. But I really liked the optimism I hear about folks wanting to go solve these existential crises, but with it, with entrepreneurship and innovation as the wind in their back, as long as it's principled and responsible, all the stuff you taught me, you are my spiritual guru on that project. I don't know if you know that any last words you want to share. Look, I'll just say one last statement, it perhaps summarizes all this, which is, I think we all have to realize this, this period of innovation, there's a false choice between impact and returns. It, it, it, it, it used to be you can invest in, impact, we can invest for a financial return. I don't think that's going to be the case for this next phase. I think the best businesses and the most impactful innovation is going to be the intersection of impact and return. And so, you know, might as well go at those big problems, Tom, as you're describing. I think that's it. That's where the opportunity lies. That's what the world needs.
