 Who you are defines how you build. This is the entrepreneurial thought leader series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. Welcome YouTube and Stanford communities to the Stanford Entrepreneurial Thought Leader seminar. I am Ravi Balani, a lecturer in the Management Science and Engineering Department at Stanford, and the Director of Alchemist and Accelerator for Enterprise Startups. The Entrepreneurial Thought Leader seminar is brought to you by Basis, the Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students, and STVP, the Entrepreneurship Center in the School of Engineering at Stanford. Today, I am thrilled to be welcoming to ETL James Reinhart. James is the CEO and co-founder of Threadup, a $2 billion publicly traded company that is one of the world's largest online resale platforms. Threadup designed a digital resale experience that aims to take the work and risk out of thrift. In an effort to make used clothes, the new normal, and create a more sustainable future for fashion. James is also another phenomenal founder with liberal arts roots. James studied history at Boston College, and like Reed Hoffman and many others, he studied philosophy, political philosophy at Oxford, and then spent seven years dedicated to secondary school education. He was a high school teacher, a communications director, he co-founded a network of the top charter schools, and he also was instrumental in developing one of the nation's premier public schools, Pacific Collegiate School. He then graduated with joint degrees from Harvard, from Harvard Business School, and Harvard Kennedy School, where he earned master's degrees in public policy and business. So with that, please welcome James. James, welcome. Thanks for having me, Robbie. Good to be here. Great to have you. I'd love to start off with the origin story of Threadup because there's so much catnip here, which is so fascinating. One of which is, if I was a life cartographer and I'm tracking your life, and this is I think a true inspiration for many of the Stanford students, your life screams out, education, politics, philosophy, and policy, and then suddenly you go to being the founder of one of the largest online reseller platforms for secondhand clothes. So can you talk us through that? How did you start Threadup, and was there a connection between the past and that venture, or what was the inspiration behind it? Robbie, I think I needed to be on a couch. It's like a therapy set. How do we get here? Well, it's great to be with all of you. And yeah, I mean, the origin story, I mean, there's a few threads in there, no pun intended. You know, I think growing up, I was always a guy who had a point of view on fashion, you know, wanted to have unique things and express my individuality with, you know, with the clothes that I wore. I think this was probably like a dormant, you know, latent part of my personality. And, you know, and then as you said, I did a bunch of other things and then I was in business school, you know, that school that shall not be named on this call. And when I got there, I didn't have any money. And so one of the days, I went and I tried to sell like some bags of clothing, you know, at the local consignment store. And they didn't take them, you know, and it was like, I remember vividly, it was like a J-Crew cashier and her sweater and a Brooks Brothers coat. And they said, you know, these things don't have any value. And I thought, man, just find that hard to believe that this cashier and sweater is worth zero. And I think that the insight that I had was like, it's worth zero to me. But in some other context, it could be worth $20 or $25. And so what I saw at that moment in time was a real market failure. And, you know, in the business school parlance, I thought these were mispriced assets. Right? In my closet, they were zero. And somebody else was positive. They'd be worth, you know, worth more. And that is really what kicked off, you know, the story. My whole life, I had been, you know, tinkering with businesses, you know, you know, the joke, like I had a long-moving business, right? And then I did. And so I think there was entrepreneurial spirit in me. And I think I found the right idea. And then got really inspired to proceed that. So that's a little bit of how I think this all came together. No, that's terrific. So you were always entrepreneurial. You were always thinking about things and you just happened to, this was the moment in your life when things, when things converged. You know, James, on this idea of market failure, there's two schools of thought I find when it comes to starting companies, some believe that startups attack markets. There's a set market size. You're going to go and take a certain share of that market. And there's another school of thought that startups create markets that founders are more like missionaries that are actually going and evangelizing and creating movements that you're more of a movement maker as a founder versus a market attacker. If you subscribe to one of those and if so, which one and any thoughts on that. Yeah, it's a great question. I think it's the time that I think to be really like intellectually honest, I think at the founding moment, it was a market failure. I was like, man, there's something wrong, right? And I told life, I think I was sort of, you know, obsessed with markets and marketing efficiencies. I think, you know, the business got started with a market failure approach. And I think what we learned in the pivots, right? And we'll probably talk about some of those right in the pivots. We realized that we could actually massively expand, you know, the town by the sets of activities that we undertook. And so not not the hedge, but I don't think it was either or I think it was a sequence where we understood a market failure, which we tried to solve. And then we engage in sort of rapidly expanding, you know, the market as it is today. And can you take us through what was the first thing you did after you had that insight, you know, when you had this instinctive knowing that something was wrong here, that there should, this is a misplaced, mispriced asset. You ended up building a marketplace business marketplace businesses are notoriously the most valuable, but also the most difficult business is great because you have a chicken and egg problem in the beginning. And you have the suppliers to get the buyers and you the buyers to get the suppliers. So when you had this that after you had that insight, what was the first thing that you did to with the business? You know, I, I did a bunch of primary research, you know, with with friends and family. And I would ask them a series of questions. I would say, you know, what percent of the clothes in your closet? Do you wear? And most people said not an odd wear a third or a half. And I said, hmm, and for the ones that you don't wear, what will you do with it? And consistently, everybody said, eventually, I'll just give them away. And then I asked that I developed a third question to that after a couple of weeks, I said, well, how's that going to make you feel? And they said, I don't know, just what you do. And, you know, and so I pulled together enough data points where I was like, interesting, right? Under the UIs part of the closet, people are going to eventually give it away. And they're going to feel not great about it. Like, is there an opportunity to improve every part, you know, that experience? And, and so when I got started, you know, the third of that started, we, we were really focused on peer to peer. And I remember like the original pitch slides, right? It was all about building a better version of eBay. You know, how do we reduce the friction that was involved, you know, in eBay? And, you know, so that was sort of all the research that we did. And, you know, I think the business got started as peer to peer. We quickly learned, you know, how challenging that marketplace dynamic is because you're constantly relying on sellers. And so I think that's when we started to iterate on what's the right way to access supply. And that's sort of where we landed on the business, you know, as it is today. But it, but, but it was very much primary research at the beginning. And then the massive unlock I created to a professor of mine, the HBS, who, when I was running this small pilot trying to figure out whether there was a there there, you know, I had a few hundred customers, you know, friends and family, people like on Facebook and so forth. And I thought that like I had, I had found something that made sense, right? Classics or a product market fit stuff. And I went to one of my professors and he said, well, how many users do you have using this thing? And I was like, I think I've really nailed it. I mean, I think we're, we got something that like really got a scale. And he was like, well, do you have like 10,000 people using it? I was like, you know, like live like 300. You know, you'll get product market fit when you get to 10,000, then like you'll know that there's a there there. And I remember walking out of his office and then like, yeah, you know, but he was right, right? And I often like share that advice down with other entrepreneurs. Like you can't get 10,000 people to use it on the internet these days. Like you don't have a thing. So that's your golden metric is 10,000. I mean, that's a good metric. I mean, yeah, as any for like out of the gate, you know, for for consumer. If you can't get 10,000 people to love it, you're not going to get 10 million. But was that the moment for you? I mean, can you tell us when they were when you had the moment that you knew this was going to be a big business. When did that occur? I think it was when we opened. So, you know, 2011, we were tinkering with pure getting out of the peer to peer business. 2012 was when we unlocked what we do today, which is this managed managed marketplace where we manage all the logistics to really unlocks a buy, you know, to your previous question. Right. We were really unlocking a new market by doing all the work for people. And I think, you know, we built our first distribution center and it wasn't really talk about 2014, where I was starting to see the organic supply. Come into the market at like very high rates where I started to get conviction that like we had really struck a nerve on the supply side. People were sending us lots of great clothing for free. And we were able to resell it in good margins. And so that's kind of what I knew we were on something. You know, and then I think it took another year or two for me to really appreciate it, you know, the company could be worth $10 billion a day. But so that moment that you knew it was when there was an organic inflow of supply. You weren't soliciting it. People were just coming to you with activities. And you know, we had Justin Con on two weeks ago, the confounder of Twitch. And he talks about this moment when you know that the boulder is just rolling down the hill. And it's not that you're pushing it. It's just you're chasing it. That was that. And was there. Can you quantify that? Was there a percentage that you saw at that moment when you were like, oh, this is significant. I just, you know, people talk about viral coefficients, right? And, and you know, at that time in 2013, 2014, like our viral coefficient on the supply part of our business was above one. Right. People would do it. And, you know, and it's become such a problem now that we actually now so much supply that the challenge in our business is we have struck such a nerve on the organic clean outside. We were drowning, you know, so to speak in lots of product. And so I think it's why we weren't doing anything. And we were just bags were just coming in the door, right? And like, and people were sending us the bag. And then saying, can you send me 10. And that really, you know, I mean, and then I'll go step further is and maybe Justin talked about this in his experience is even when people would have like a non optimal experience. They would want to do it again. Right. You're like, it's a you really know you're solving a problem when people are like, it took too long to process. You didn't pay me very much. Man, I love to do it again. You said you said that. Right. And then you kind of know, right? I mean that you're on that you have product market fit. And just to be clear, that was how many years after you founded it. Oh, I didn't really feel that probably until 2013, 2014. So four years. Four years after you founded it. I think one of the hallmarks of being an entrepreneur is that the job changes or a founder is that the job changes so much as the come and sometimes the very skills that allowed your success in one phase. Are going to be orthogonal to what's required in the next phase. And a lot of the core decisions are whether or not you stay the course or give up. And so I'd like to dive deep into that because, you know, even before you hit to that point where you knew for sure that this was going to succeed. You had 27 investors. I understand that you pitch that said this was a failure. And yet, and at that point you said, no, I still think it's going to persist at that. And then I talked us through the fundraising process. How many people said no to you and how you made the decision to say my internal conviction should trump their external opinion. And when do you decide to listen to external feedback versus your own internal gut and when do you decide to listen to your gut versus external feedback. I mean, I think there's I don't know who's who's famous for saying this. So I just I steal it. But like this notion that you have to be contrarian to start big businesses and you have to be right. And and I took a lot of calm. I took a lot of. I got increasing amounts of confidence when people are like, this seems way too hard. And I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's really, really, really hard. But man, if we get it right, it's going to become massive. And it's going to be really hard for people to compete with us. And so I was, you know, because I was in business school, remember when we started the business, I was sort of obsessed with these like fundamental frameworks around competitive advantage. And like how you build like disruptive businesses like I took, you know, I had play Christians in a professor, right. I was like obsessed with like how he thought about the world and like. And so I was I was played for the students plays the author of the innovators dilemma, which is the classic work on building disruptive companies from the bottom of the up. Just passed away, I think a couple of years ago, but but incredible man and and so I think I just believe that like I was struck, I was building something that was structurally correct. And that I just need to raise enough money to keep going to prove to people that I was going to be right on the other side. And and so, um, dance your question about the fundraising process like, yeah, it was really hard because you're trying to convince, you know, a bunch of, you know, generally. So generally speaking like wealthy white people, you wealthy white men that you were you're going to sell us clothes on the internet. And you know, that's not necessarily like investor product fit. And so, you know, I think one of the things that I learned in that process was I, you know, at the time we were more focused on kids on kids business, because kids was like a natural replacement cycle kids grow. You know, our first our first tagline was closed on grow kids do. And so what I realized in that process is I needed to find a really sharp investor that also happened to be female and have kids and like appreciate like what this is like in the life of a normal person. And so when I found Patricia in the costume is that Trinity ventures. And and I don't teach us a classic Stanford, you know, coincidentally, I think she really like she got it, you know, and like our conversation, you know, as you know, was she was like, hey, I really get this. Tell me how you can make money. And that's a very different conversation than I don't even know how this works. And so I think that was the difference in the fundraise process. And I give Patricia a lot of credit for seeing it and getting in and getting it right. I got a question about the repeating the name of the book. The book is the innovators dilemma. It's a classic entrepreneurship book, Clayton Christensen is an icon students. You should check it out. But I want to just underscore what James was saying about fundraising. You know, I oftentimes tell my students that it's fundraising is not so much about convincing investors that you're right, but finding the investor that's looking for you and doesn't know that you exist. And going after that. And how many investors said no before Patricia said yes. I'm on record as a being 27, but I think that numbers low. I mean, you know, and I'm probably like, you know, and then through my whole journey, I'll be in a public company where investors come and go, right. You know, it's probably a hundred investors. You know, even when the company was having some modest success who like just like didn't really believe. And so yeah, it's it's challenging out there. And I also want to sort of go down a path. So that was an example of where you stuck to your conviction because you had a belief that you knew to be true. And you listen to your internal conviction over these external views. I'd love to also explore a situation where you actually pivoted or changed where you had some internal belief and you decided to change. And I think that was the shift from the peer to peer marketplace. But I feel like we oftentimes talk about the victories. And we live in a tech crunch world where everything is glossed over. But we don't talk about the struggles. And I would just want to invite you to share any struggle or struggles that you can share that you have gone through in the journey and how you got through them. Yeah, but I think your point about like, you know, when when do you change course and pivot? I think it's an important one. And I think that's where I remember with them. Right. And so I think when we started out just to think the picture. We started out peer and peer focused on men's. So think like business model peer to peer category men's. And then I said, then our first thing was well, a men's thing. That's stupid. That's not going to work. But peer to peer, maybe something there. So we pivoted kids. And so we appeared appear kids, right. And that took like a year. And so I think that that men's thing wouldn't work. Did you test it? Yeah, I mean, that was the two to 300 people that I had. Okay. But I could never get to 400 or 500. And you know, when you have a product that's not going to work on people say, I don't think I'll use it. But I'm sure my I think my friend will use it. Right. That's like, you know, the death now. People don't want to tell you your ideas to good. So they say it's not for them. But maybe for somebody else. I heard that enough to be like, yeah. But then in that process, I heard a lot of will say, hey, I really wouldn't use it for myself. But I wouldn't use it for my kids. You know, they're parents and they understood kids are growing. And so so we were we sort of went with some of the customer feedback. And so we went from peer to peer. And then we had kids. And and then kids, you know, who who shops for kids but parents. And we ruled out men. So that meant kids and moms. Right. And so we had peer to peer kids and moms. And then we realized that like kids and moms was great. But peer to peer was wrong. And so the next version that was in like 2011 was kids, moms and then managed marketplace. And it was a bad moment where we sort of got the two together. That that we saw acceleration. But it was like not without, not without controversy. I remember going to a board meeting where things weren't going well. And when we were we had we were in the kids peer to peer business. And I was like, and we're going to launch women's. And I remember the board being like, what are we doing? Right. And you know, but we were constantly navigating for the largest market, you know, with the right kind of business model. And those were very challenging times. And in those challenging times, how do you overcome resistance? So when the board is shaking their heads, what do you do? You know, I think that you have to find that balance of, you know, your, your, your, your sort of base instincts around what you believe about the world. And then you have to follow some of the data. But you know, the problem with the joke right the problem with the data solve is it's all about the past. Right. The data is not a roadmap for the future. And so, you know, I was sort of obsessed with like, where do I believe the consumer is going? And, you know, at that time, I just really believe there was going to be this, you know, sustainability mindset, you know, how the consumer was moving. And I had a bunch of, you know, you know, data that said like, hey, you can get the supply out there. You get the supply. There's a there there in this market. So then it was ultimately like, how do we drive the business to access that supply? And, you know, I think that's why when you say one that I know it would work, right? It was a year from there where we really unlocked supply in a powerful way. Okay. And I'd love to sort of talk about this notion of sustainability and that conviction that you had around that and how that interplays with, you know, there's this narrative of iterating towards victory. And then you're moving from men to kids to women. And then there's this enduring mission or the sense of purpose around sustainability. Can you talk a little bit more about threat of submission? How do you define the mission? How central is sustainability to the mission or vision of the company? And when did you when did you set the mission? And how did you make sure that you kept the company's values as you were going through these iterations and scaling? Yeah, it's a really good question. I think in the early days, you know, we had a set of values, but we didn't really have the mission. It took it took until I think probably 2012, 2013 to three years before we really codified, hey, what's the mission of this business? And it's because I think in the early days, you know, as I said, it was, it was sort of like, hey, are we solving this market failure piece, right? And like bringing, you know, bringing, you know, great children's clothes to parents, but we had really locked on to like, you know, what was really going to drive, you know, all the organizing activities. And so I think, I think it was like 2012, where we like sat down like, yeah, what is the mission? And I think that's where we ended up on, you know, our mission inspired new generation of consumers to think secondhand first. And embedded in that right was was all sorts of things around, you know, new generation, right? It was like, hey, we're thinking about the feet, we're thinking about where people are going to be, not where the world is today. Think secondhand first became like a real big mantra for us because we knew if we weren't ultimately going to get everybody to have 100% of the clothes in their closet, be second hand, right? That doesn't make any sense. But what we could change the mindset where you thought like, hey, maybe if you do need something new, maybe you should start with threat. We often use that phrase. Like we want you to at least start here. You may have a shopping and buying it you, but we want to put ourselves in a position to have you start there. And then the mission, you know, we kept like testing it and, you know, time people are like, hey, I think we should evolve the mission. And, you know, I've sort of told people like, no, I think this is the mission. We should stay true to it. And, you know, until it no longer until it's until it's too, it till it constrains us. It feels like the right journey to be on. And then your point about sustainability, I think. I think it was something we believe was going to matter in the future, you know, in the early days of the company. But what I can't remind the team of and reminding myself of is that, you know, sustainability is is not the end goal. Right. Like what we want to do is building great business. That could create a sustainable outcome. And, and I remember with somebody explaining to me that like, you know, it's, it's, we were using example of like seventh generation, which was like that like sustainable cleaning wipes. And they did like whole products. And we were talking about how like the problem with seventh generation has that it was so much more expensive. And so people want to be sustainable, but they don't want to be sustainable by paying a lot more. And one of the things that really like for me that I drove in every day is like, you can be sustainable and pay less. That's the magic of shopping second hand. And I mean, that's what's really driven us. That is great. And, and, and so that crystallized after three years and it sounds like it got really, really well honed. At the beginning though, it sounds like there wasn't a mission, but you had values. How important was it to have values at the beginning? And is that something that you recommend to founders? And how did that come into play? I think that the values in the found in the very early years are like the values of your founders. And, and we didn't write them down, which is who we were. Right. And so it took a few years for us. It probably came after the mission statement that we sat down and wrote like, what are the values? And in, and that process came from hiring. All of a sudden we were hiring that next layer of people where, you know, I wasn't interacting with them every day. Chris, my co-founder wasn't an interaction with them every day. And so the values that ooze through the company, they actually need to be written down and shared and talked about. And so, and so that you know what you appreciate like the value story. So when we signed right to values. Great, let's do, let's codify the values. So we had a committee. Right. People would probably want to gather up, but we, you know, we came up with values. PowerPoint, you know, and I get the values and I was like, these are my values. Like the, this, this is these are the values of some amorphous company on the internet. Like did you guys download these? And I was like, we're not doing this. And I went home and on the weekend, just, I just wrote them like, like, gut, like from the gut, like what the values were. And that became, that became the values for like seven years of the company. And it was just in my own, my own words, you know, why, you know, how I wanted to run the company and, yeah, that's kind of where we went today. And were they values that some people would disagree with or were they sort of mom and apple pie that were generically good virtues. They were generally good virtues, but they, but they had, they had like twists on them around like why, you know, why we wanted them to be, why I wanted them to be what they were. Right. And like, for example, one of them was on was influence outcomes, right, which on its face, like, yeah, influence outcomes. But like, I'm obsessed with this notion that like it's all about the outputs. It's not about the inputs. And so like everything in the threat of business is like, I want to know about what the output is. I don't want to, I don't care that it took 10 hours. Right. If the output is not good. That doesn't matter. If it took 10 minutes, the outputs amazing. That's great. And it goes back to my teaching career. I remember when I was a first year teacher, there was this wise old woman, Sharon Cadwalder, a god bless her. She was like 70 years old. And I walked into the teaching lounge as first year teacher. And I was like, man, I don't know what I'm going to teach today. And she was like, James, it's not what you're going to teach. It's one of the students going to learn today. And it has always stuffed with me, right, because there's an inputs way of thinking about the world. And there's an outputs way of thinking about the world. And so that's shared with Kimball our story is like what we talk about today. That's fantastic. And I love that thread connecting teaching to entrepreneurship too. James, I'd love to get your comments on resilience because it's now been 12 years of threat up. And I think, you know, people think about startups as these sexy things. And few people realize that they're really marathon. So when you, you know, if you endure as you have, it's been 12 years. So can you share any practices or tools that you've really treasured that you would want to pass on to the next generation of founders that have helped you stay resilient and engaged over the course of 12 years. Well, I mean, a few things. I mean, one is like, I think if you're working on a business that like you that has a mission and a vision, and you think it's making the world a better place. And it's a lot easier to stick with it when it's hard. And you know, when I talk to entrepreneurs, you know, over the years who are who are doing things that could be fine businesses, but, you know, their, their things that aren't necessarily like making the world a better place. And so I always remind them, like, hey, it's going to get really hard at some point. Like, do you want to look back and be like, man, I spent five years building a Facebook game. Right. And, you know, when, when that was a thing, right. And so I always tell people, like, look, it does take 10, 10 plus years. And I was lucky enough back to education, the school that I worked at specifically at school. One of the big donors that school was really hasty. See a Netflix. And through through the early years, read and I became friends. And I remember talking to read one day, and I said to him something that has seared into my brain. I was like, hey, read. This was like, 2013 or 14. I was like, what do you think about this red box company? You know, the red box like kiosks. I was like, seems like they've come out of nowhere. You know, dollar DVDs like, you know, this is what methods was really a DVD company. He's like James. That company has been added for over a decade. Right. That's the coin start guys. Like, these guys have been working super hard for more than a decade. Like, this stuff takes a long time. And for whatever reason that like really stuck with me that like, this stuff takes a long time. And so, so I always like have read in the background when I'm like, as long as I'm working on something I care about, you know, he's been at Netflix since 97. You know, and so 25 years, right of passion and purpose. And I think I think that's a good, it's a good way to think about the world. And you know, on this idea of taking a long time, you, I mean, obviously on the face of it, it looks like threat up is this marketplace for used clothes, but, but deeper, it's actually this very complex logistics and engineering organization. And I'm curious, if you, without the formal training in logistics or all the technology that's used, can you share, because I think many founders or students will have imposter syndrome. You feel like they can't go into a market without being, you know, having formal training in that market. How did you learn to build the premier, one of the premier logistics organizations in the world without having a formal background in that. I mean, yeah, it's a bit cliche, right, it is all about the team that you build, right. I mean, and so I think, you know, founders like myself, there are certain things that I'm really good at. You know, I'm good at, at the strategy piece of the storytelling and I think I have some natural and things around products and markets, fundraising, despite, you know, my failures the first 27 times. But, but, but, but so, you know, my co founder Chris, you know, he was a rocket scientist at Princeton, you know, he's a Harvard Business School with me, the smartest guy I've ever met in my life. He was really important, you know, in the process, all one of my other co founders was computer science major. You know, so those two guys were really critical. And then, and then yeah, people will talk enough about luck. And like on the logistics piece, we got lucky, right. And so I sort of share with you kind of the read Netflix connection. And so it was because I sort of knew read that I was able to raise money from red point ventures. I need Tim Haley, who happens to sit on the board at Netflix. And so there was a lot of Netflix DNA flown around and Tim knew a guy. And he rendage who joined my board and Andy had a friend John Boris who worked in Netflix who was, he said, is the best systems officer he's ever met. And I managed to convince John Boris to come and join thread up 2012. And I was like, this is a logistics company. He was working for a long months in space. And, and you know, right moment, right time, little bit of luck. And John was like, shit, I don't want to keep community down LA. Yeah, I'll work on this. Right. And, and we pulled it off. And in fact, John is now retiring in a couple of weeks, spent nine years and he's retiring, you know, for good. You know, so it's a little bit of luck really. I have to say, well, I think founders don't talk enough about that. But I think it's so much of it is, yeah, it can be timing and luck. Let me turn it over to the students now. So I'm going to, I'm, I'll let's, I'll kick it off with the first question. How important are ethics and sustainability to your company's mission. And what do you tell people to encourage others to start shopping second hand? How do you steer them away from fast fashion and constant consumption? Yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's a, it's a core part of our DNA. So we, we really try to help people understand that, that every time they buy something used, they're like making a really good decision for the planet. You know, buying something used compared to buying something new saves 82% of an items carbon footprint. Right. So 82% less carbon in a used item relative to a new item. And so I think what we try and do is we don't try and preach to people. What we try and do is pat them on the back for making good choices. And, you know, people generally don't like to be preach to, but we all love to hear like, you know, when we get, I remember the nest reports, you'd like, hey, you've used less energy than your neighbors. And you're like, awesome, right? I don't want to be brow meat that like, hey, you're the guy using the most energy on the street. And so I do think that like that positive encouragement is really important. You know, and I think on the fast fashion side, what we really try to help people understand is that what people love about fast fashion is these low prices and sort of individuality and sort of the uniqueness. And I think resale is a really good example where you can get those low prices. You get that individuality, but you get into a sustainable way. And so that's how we try and thread that people. That's great. The next question is how important is initial velocity following launch? How long should it take for a good idea to get those first 10,000 customers? Yeah, you know, and I don't know probably the 10,000 customers, like, is that, that might be dated these days, you know, like in 2009 that seemed like a lot, you know, these days with social platforms. It's, it's maybe it's too low. But, but I think it's one of those areas where you should see like organic word of mouth early, like it should, you know, there's lots of them written around like your product should be good enough. The expression you can know that people want to be like, hey, have you used this thing? Do you know about this? And if people aren't willing to talk about it. Talk about to their friends, share it with their colleagues, then it's going to be an uphill battle. And I think, you know, to give you the real raw example, like, we've really cracked that on the supply side. We've talked about, like, we've only, we've only sort of cracked it on the buyer side, right? There's lots of competition out there where you can buy, buy clothing. And so I would say we, our vital coefficient on the supply side way higher, for example, than on the demand side. So, you know, it's not necessarily perfect. That's great. Next question. How do you feel about your decision to go public? Did you have any major hesitations at the time? Has thread up struggled with the loss of privacy with regards to having to slow stock ownership margins to competitors and customers executive compensation, et cetera, caused by IPOing? I don't think we feel like we thought it was the right time. You know, I think the market was was very receptive to the story that we were telling, you know, around resale and the category of events and the category growth. You know, and sometimes I think, you know, the company is just at the stage when it just feels right, you know, you have the systems in place, you have the data. And so we just felt like it was right. And I think the process of going public made us a much better company. I think the thing people don't talk enough about is just the rigor of that process. It's really powerful stuff. And so I actually think that we're a better company now that we're a public company. And, and yeah, I think I think it's great for us to be public. Next question. Did you always know that you wanted to do something with a socially positive mission? Where did you first pursue thread up because you believed in the idea of buying selling second hand? I think I've always been a mission guy, you know, I think part of why I started off as a teacher. And you know, teaching English and history that eighth graders is, you know, I think I always wanted to do something good in the world. And so I think, you know, I thought education, you know, was was an incredibly, you know, powerful calling. So I do think somewhere in my life, it got burned into me that I wanted to do some good in the world. And so I think when I came up with the idea for thread up, you know, it's early years, I saw this wonderful opportunity to build a good business and also do good. And then that sort of reflects, you know, how I run the company today. So yeah, yeah, I think I've always wanted to do something good. Do you think that the public financial markets focus on quarterly earnings and your term profits hinders companies that aim to tackle long term problems requiring more time and research? Oh, I don't know if I have a much of a much of an expert on that. I mean, I think, you know, great public companies, you know, take Tesla, take Apple, take Amazon. I figured out a way to invent the future while being public companies. So, so no, I don't think it necessarily hinders, you know, innovation. It does, it does mean that, that these companies have, have to have incredibly great stories to tell. And, you know, they're run, run by incredible founders. So, so I think it can be, if you're a great founder, a great story of big, you have a big vision to tell, I think the public is, there's no better platform, you know, to get the capital you need to build the business you want to build. So. And do you feel pressure though from near term quarterly results to steer strategic decisions? No, I mean, you know, we only have public, you know, a few quarters, but I've been really helping investors understand sort of the long term view and just being very consistent with our investments in the future and where we see the opportunity and so yeah, no, I think, like I said, I think the public is really good for us. And, you know, I think it's just important that you really communicate what you're trying to accomplish. Next question is, what were the key aspects of adapting to COVID? How did you keep your customers engaged and comfortable with buying second hand clothes when fears of viruses and transmission were so prevalent? Yeah, great question. Yeah, and I think in the first like a couple weeks, you know, sort of March of 20 from the pandemic, there was a little bit of like a head scratcher of like nobody really was understood how the virus was being transmitted. I think there was a lot of a lot of confusion. And so he definitely experienced that with our customers, but but quickly, right, people realize that the virus didn't, you know, get transmitted on, you know, part of our boxes and it could live long enough. And so I think once we had reliable data around how it got transmitted, it was pretty easy to communicate to customers, but yeah, the first couple of weeks, I was like, man, I don't know, you know, and then we sort of figured it out. But did you also suffer from a drop in demand because I imagine the main reason why people are buying clothes is to show off and social social. And so I did, yeah, a drop in demand and then I'm really mixed in what you were buying, right? So instead of buying shoes and dresses for going out, right? They're buying loungewear and shorts. We've never sold more shorts, you know, than we did in the first few months of the pandemic. And were there any enduring lessons from that on staying agile that you learned from the COVID experience that you'd want to share? Yeah, I really learned something. You know, I mean, we got sharper around forecasting from merchandising and the man planning, but I also, you know, it was such a black swan event that we try and draw too many lessons, you know, from it. Because I think you can scenario plan for for blacks want events all day. But I think a lot of time that's a waste time. Next question. What has your experience been with staying patient through the process of reaching profitability? Well, I think the way that we think about profits is like, you know, we obviously want to build a profitable, you know, sustaining business over the long term, but we're really balancing, you know, growing into what we believe is a massive, addressable market. And so the way that we really run the business and we communicated to, you know, to investors shareholders is, hey, we want to continue to grow, you know, at a really strong rate. And we want to continue to show leverage, you know, in the business. And so I think as long as we accomplish both of those things, it's pretty easy to see, you know, where profitability comes over the over the short to medium term. And sort of how we think about it. I think if we were in a market that was small and contracting, right, might be a different story. But we're in a market that seems to get bigger every year. Yep. Okay, next question is on gender. How does the gender of your customers impact your business choices? Does the gender of your target market impact how you make decisions with marketing or development? We always sell to women, you know, primarily, we do have some men who buy for their children or, or, but, yeah, we don't sell men's clothing. And because we don't believe the men's market is as matured as big, you know, in second hand, it's just a women's market. But I get asked about that all the time, you know, people want, when you do a men's, when you do a men's, when you do a men's. But I've really tried to be rigorous around let's stay focused on the women's market. Because it is, it's a lot easier to communicate your marketing messages, even the colors on your website. Now the products are positioned, right. It is very much categorized for a female audience. And so, yeah, we feel like by constraining our market in that way, we're able to better serve it. And the founding team is all male. It is. Yeah. And is that an issue? You know, I think back to sort of the team approach, right. I think we've had to make sure that we bring in a diverse set of perspectives to make sure that like we're serving our target customer, you know, correctly. But I don't think it's been a huge, I don't think it's been a huge issue, but I don't have the counterfactual. So maybe it was business founded by women and would be 10 times the size. Okay. Fair enough. Next question. Next question is, who would you say is your biggest demographic threat up? Any interesting insights on what group you initially targeted versus which group you ended up utilizing threat up? I know we talked a little bit about this, but they specifically said millennials versus boomers. And we generally skew younger, you know, it's people, but they tend to be people in their 20s and 30s. You know, I don't think we're we have quite a side penetration for teens. And you know, we do have some boomers, like one of the things that unites kind of the threat community is it is a broad segment of the population. And I really focus on that probably 25 to 45 female demographic shopping for themselves or shopping for their kids. Okay. Next question. As you mentioned, finding the right product market fit can take several years. How do you know when it has been too long to find this fit when what keeps the founder convinced that it will eventually will happen eventually? Is there any way that you can foresee or calculate that it will happen? Well, I think two things happen, which is you get enough positive data to kind of confirm that you're getting closer or you run out of money. And you know, running out of money is a pretty clear indicator that like you haven't figured it out. And so, you know, the the old truism of like being the CEO is like you got to set the strategy higher the people and never run out of money. That's so true. You just need to keep cash in. So whatever way you can, you need to get cash is cash is oxygen. Next question is does pivoting one too many times mean the business is fundamentally flawed and should be shut down. Yeah, I mean, it gets back to that. Yeah, I think you can pick up lots of times until you find the right thing. You know, assuming you have the cash is object. So, you know, I think I think there are lots of great businesses out there, you know, Stuart Butterfield that's slack. You know, you built the business is totally different. You know, the guys on Instagram built bourbon. It was totally different. You know, if you had Kevin Sistramon here, he would tell you that was terrible idea. We took a while to find a good idea. So I don't think it's a number of pivots. I think it's that you end up having to find something that really does work while you still have money in the bank. And if you run out of money and you're just a founder with high conviction, you're like, I just want to be a founder. I want to start this business. Is there a moment when you would say, you know what, you should take a break and not continue this venture and do something else. You know, I mean, everybody has personal circumstances that sort of change their ability that kind of, you know, to pursue the entrepreneurial endeavor. But I've always found that like, like, there's more capital chasing businesses than businesses chasing capital. I do believe the markets are pretty efficient. And there's lots of money out there looking for great entrepreneurs with great ideas. And so if you have, if you have a great idea, right, if you are a great entrepreneur, you will find the money. And so, and so sometimes you need to take a break, you know, to kind of regroup. But I don't think that means that people should stop pursuing, stop pursuing their passion to do something entrepreneurial. Next question is on luck. I'm going to ask this question, which is a word you used about the success in fundraising is luck. Can it be interpreted as the importance of network? Can, can luck be interpreted as the importance of having that network? How, how you build your network during fundraising? Is that what really luck means when we say luck? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, it's like, you know, you're, you're, you're constantly, you know, when you're out fundraising, you're constantly looking for signals about, you know, who to meet next. And, you know, or who might be helpful. But in that process, right, and the first, the pitch you give to your first investor is so different than the pitch you give to your 10th investor. And so, you know, the fundraising process is a journey in and of itself. And so you're constantly like meeting new people, refining, you know, what, what you think about it. And I think if you're, if, you know, if you're going to be successful entrepreneur, you're going to need to build a network. And that networks can help not just for fundraising, but for recruiting and partnerships and pipelines and all kinds of stuff. Right. And so I think. It's really something that people who want to be in the entrepreneur ecosystem need to pay attention to. And, you know, I've always tried to be somebody who's, who's helpful and can, and helps, you know, that helps build my network and people that I trust and be valuable to other people. I mean, you know, rather like doing this call, right. It's because, you know, the guys at red point were wonderful to me and they were like, hey, you know, and I was like, yes, I would love to do this thing for you. Right. I think there's something that's really nice about putting yourself out there and helping others. And I think if you do that, I think the world works in really positive ways. Yes, I've seen that. So again, if you're looking for insights on how to network. I mean, I even hate to use that phrase. But the best connect to people I know adopt James's philosophy where their attention is on helping the others around them. And then things will naturally can fall into place. I have time for probably one more question, James. And we really appreciate your time. I'll ask, I'll exercise. I'm going to access my prerogative and ask the second one, which is based on your experience. Do you have any further advice on how to address the chicken and egg problem in the early stages of a marketplace should founders focus first on attracting supply demand or both at the same time. Yeah, it's a there's a lot of stuff written about this. So since we don't we only have two minutes of, you know, the click notes version is, I think you have to figure out what the real long term constraint in the marketplace is going to be and spend all your time solving back. And so, you know, for example, like Airbnb, you know, their whole business is constrained by the number of hosts. Right, the hosts and supply team over there dwarfs everything else in the company, right. It's all about supply. You know, open table when they got started, right. It was all about restaurants. How do I get our software into the restaurants. And so in any marketplace, one side is going to be more constrained than the other. And generally speaking, this isn't always true, but generally speaking, supply is the constraint. And so if you can, if you can crack supply or crack a new way to bring supply online in any market, chances are like you're going to have an opportunity to win. And it doesn't mean that you'll win over the long term, but if you're going to start somewhere in marketplaces, I think supplies at the place to start.
