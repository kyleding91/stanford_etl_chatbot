 You were listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at edcorner.stanford.edu. I am very, very excited today to be able to introduce our first speaker for the quarter his name is Professor Bill Perry. How many of you have had a chance to take a class with Professor Perry at some point in your Stanford careers? We have a few who are lucky enough to do that, and the rest of you are in for a big treat. My mom was so excited that I was going to be able to introduce Professor Perry today, because in addition to being a senior fellow at the Hoover Institute and having joined appointments in the engineering school in the International Relations Institute here at Stanford, he had the honor to serve with great dignity in the role of Secretary of Defense for the United States. And mom was married to a career naval aviator and her son, the other son, the good son, became a career naval officer, and I just ran away and joined the Marines and then went into its million life. What we would say is, in the cosmic household, this is the coolest speaker that we've ever had at ETL. So mom says, thank you, Professor Perry. Let's welcome Bill, not back to Stanford, because he's here all the time when he's not serving his country with distinction. Welcome to ETL Bell. As you can see from the chart, the title of my talk today is, it's your ship. And I will first of all explain what that strange title means. When I was the Secretary of Defense, Mike Abbershoff does spectacular job for me as my military assistant. He then went on to command a needy's class destroyer. When he was captain of that ship, it won awards twice as the best ship in the Pacific Fleet. This success resulted from a very unmilitary style of leadership that Mike had. When a sailor assigned to a job on the ship would approach Mike to ask him, which of several alternatives he thought would be best, Mike always answered, it's your ship. If you think of it that way, it's your ship, you'll make the right answer. After his command, Mike left the navy to write a book and to pursue a career with innovative companies. First, he wrote his book and entitled the book, it's your ship. And there's the book and there's Mike. The book costs quite a stern industry and Mike was frequently cited as a model for leadership. As a result, he was very profarily distracted from his new career by a blizzard of offers to give leadership lectures. He is still a year later, still giving those leadership lectures, but is now beginning the aback to his idea of working with startup companies and is presently the CEO of a very interesting startup company called Neo-Canetics. I can tell you more about his company in the Q&A, but for now I want to get back to his book. In that book, he wrote that his ideas for leadership had been inspired by my example. I was, of course, flattered, but it did cause me to wonder what he was referring to. So I began to look back on my own career. I'm going today, I'm going to share with you a few vignettes from my career that I believe make Mike's points about leadership. Way back in the 1960s, I was the director of a local high tech company in the defense electronics industry. The company was a part of GT&E, General Telephone and Electronics, but I based my model of management, not on GT&E, which I thought was a star G-old Eastern giant, but on HP, Hula Packard, which was a relatively small, highly, you have trouble thinking of HP as being relatively small, but in 1960, it was relatively small. And it highly innovated the company located right next door in Palo Alto. The HP principles, as I understood them, were innovate, manage by walking around and treat employees as stakeholders. Today, HP is perhaps the greatest high tech company in the world, but in those days it was struggling to get a toe hold in electronics industry dominated by large traditional companies based on the East Coast. I tried to apply the HP principles to my company and had very good results in the three years I was the director, going from 600 employees to 1200 employees while tripling the profits. But I could only go so far operating under the restrictions of GT&E in particular. I had no way of allowing the employees to share in the profits of the company. So I decided to leave GT&E and found my own company. Now that's commonplace in the valley today, but it was almost not heard of in 1964. And I can assure you, my parents and most of my friends thought I'd gone mad to leave a good, sound job at a nice company like GT&E to take a chance to start my own company. The new company, which I called ESL, was to be in the defense electronic business as was the company I was leaving. But I planned to focus ESL on the newly emerging digital technology. In contrast, the GT&E, which is leader in analog technology. In fact, GT&E suffered from what I call a liability of leadership, liability of leadership. That is because of its leadership in analog technology, it was not able to take advantage of the new digital technology in a timely way. Indeed, GT&E through the Souranius Observatory was one of the world's largest manufacturers of vacuum tubes. Many of you don't even know what a vacuum tube is. But in 1964, it was a big thing. And they saw the revolution underway in integrated circuits and digital circuits, not as an opportunity, but as the threat to their very profitable business and vacuum tubes. I plan to continue to manage by the H.P. principle of management by walking around M.B.W.A. management by walking around, which I had found to be very successful. And I plan to seize the opportunity presented by a new company to make all of the employees stakeholders in the company, telling them in the most direct way possible it's your ship. So I rejected offers, Adventure Capital funding or even Angel funding. ESL would be a full associate's company with all of the funding supplied by the stock, bought by employees. All employees, when they started work, had a three month window in which they could buy a specified amount of ESL stock. Nearly all of them did so, using their savings or caching in their pension funds for the average investment of about $5,000, which in 1964 was a lot of money. They were stakeholders in every sense of the word. By this means we raised a half million dollars capital, the first year we were in business. This reminds me of what that first year in business was like. By the end of the first year, ESL was profitable. And from then on, we invested all of the profits to sustain the growth of the company, which ran about 40% a year for the first 10 years. 13 years after I started ESL, I was asked to window the government as the Director of Defense Research and Engineering. I did not want to leave the company I had founded. We were on a growth track, comparable to that of HP, and it's first 13 years, and I wanted to keep it going. But on serious consideration, I decided that the job offered me was too important and too interesting to turn down. And so I reluctantly divorced myself from the company that I had founded and headed back to Washington. Six months after I left ESL, the board accepted an offer from T.I.W. The early employees of ESL made about 50 times their original stock price. So they found T.R.W. is hard to refuse. Although it is clear that if they'd stayed independent and kept growing for another five or six years, they probably could have achieved a thousand times on the original investment. Today ESL still exists, but it no longer has the special qualities that it had as an independent company. Not surprisingly, after its acquisition, many of its most innovative people left, and ESL got stuck at annual sale of a few hundred million dollars per year. It is interesting to note that a company called SAIC, which was founded a year later than ESL and modeled after it as an associate's company, continues today as an independent employee on company, and today it has annual revenues of eight billion dollars. Now let me turn to applying these management principles to a government agency. Now I've left ESL, I'm in the government. When I was the Director of Defense Research and Engineering, I found incredible opportunities for innovative products. At the time we were in the most intense part of the Cold War, and feared that the Soviet Union was developing such a large and capable military force that our deterrence might not be effective. I was charged with developing a strategy that would allow the United States military to compete with the Vante Red Army, even though it was three times as large as us. I decided to apply to military systems the newly emerging information technology in which American commercial industry led the world. These new high technology systems I believed would give our military forces a qualitative advantage that would offset the quantitative advantage of the Soviet Union military. Secretary of Defense at that time, Harold Brown, named this appropriately enough, the offset strategy. And gave me, as his newly appointed Director of Defense Research and Engineering, the responsibility and resources to develop and apply the relevant technology as fast as recently could be done. So very early in my tenure, I went to an agency called ARPA, the Advanced Research Project Agency, which among other things, at that same time in history was developing something called the ARPAnet, which later became the Internet. ARPA worked for me at the Director of Defense Research and Engineering. So I went to them and said, please brief me on all the advanced sensors that would be the basis for the soft-set strategy. During those briefings at ARPA, I was introduced to an audacious new research project that was exploring an entirely new way of configuring aircraft that would make the aircraft immune to attack by radar or infrared guided missiles. I saw immediately that the so-called stealth technology, if successful, would give our military an overwhelming advantage. So I told the ARPA Director that he would have all the resources he needed to prove out the concept as quickly as possible. Within six months, the project team had a successful flight test of a prototype aircraft which served as a convincing proof of principle. I then put the program in what we call deep security and brought in the Air Force to work jointly with ARPA to define, develop, and build a stealthy fighter bomber, which we call the F-117. This is a picture of the F-117 as a test site which is called Area 51 in Nevada. Some of you may have heard of Area 51. It's become famous in the Internet lore as where the US government keeps aliens. I can assure you, I've been there many times. There are no aliens there, but there are very secret airplanes. We also built an innovative warship based on stealth, and this is a picture of that warship and its test run in San Francisco Bay. If you look carefully at the back of the ship, you'll see a man standing with an orange jacket. That is your speaker who was overseeing this first test flight, first test run of what we called the seashadow. That ship was a prototype ship. It was never built exactly like that, but the principles of that ship were later used in that Egypt's story, which you saw in the picture of Captain Abershoff earlier on. Although stealth was a critically important component, the ultimate success of the offset strategy also depended on two other related components. A new family of intelligent sensors that could identify and locate in real time all enemy forces in the battle area, these systems we called smart sensors. And a new family of munitions that could strike the target so like located with great precision. These systems we called smart weapons, of which the Tomahawk cruise missile was the most prominent. The military capability, resulting from America's offset strategy, was what the United States had in place when the war with Iraq broke out in 1989, the war which we called Desert Storm. The resulting military operation demonstrated that these radical new military systems had remarkably high degree of effectiveness in actual combat. It's probably to be getting sound. The effectiveness of these new systems depended not on massive firepower, which is the key to success in World War II, but on much less but dramatically more precise firepower. After four years of the Director of Defense Research and Engineering, I left Washington and came back to Palo Alto. My old company was now a subsidiary of TRW and I had no interest in rejoining it. Instead I joined a high tech investment in venture capital firm named Hamburg and Christworth, the time was located in San Francisco. A few years later, it took a position in Stanford and a small department known as Economic Engineering Systems and Operations Research, which is the predecessor to the MSNE department, which is one of the sponsors of this course. In 1993, I was asked to come back to Washington again. First is the Deputy Secretary of Defense and then a year later as the Secretary of Defense. The Soviet Union had broken up by then, the cold war was over, but we were faced with new dangers. All of the newly formed republics of the Soviet Union were suffering economic, social, and political upheavals. Our greatest concern for the country's an upheaval had nuclear weapons. This was a prime opportunity for innovation. The security dangers I faced were very different from the dangers faced by my predecessors, so their strategies were of no use to me. I needed a very new strategy. With the cold war over, I considered the major security dangers of the United States a terror group getting a nuclear bomb and detonating it in one of our cities. But I knew that a terror group could not make a bomb from scratch. It would have to buy or steal the bomb or the fifth cell material from a nuclear power. So I believed that I had to take all actions available to keep that from happening. As a result, I set my highest priority Secretary of Defense the dismantling of thousands of nuclear weapons and bringing under strict security control the remaining weapons and fissile material. The dismantlement was already well underway in the United States, but the four nuclear powers in the former Soviet Union could ill afford the expenses involved in the safe dismantlement and the safeguarding of the weapons and the fissile material. We needed to provide help. And fortunately, a tool was available to me. Two visionary senators, Senator Nunn and Senator Lugar, sensing this danger had just passed a program which of course was called the Nunn Lugar program, which gave the Secretary of Defense the authority and the resources to deal with this problem. My first goal was to complete elimination of nuclear weapons in the new nuclear powers. Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus created by the breakup of the Soviet Union. Just to give you a feeling of how serious this problem was, Ukraine at that time had 2000 nuclear weapons. They had more nuclear weapons than England, France, and China combined. And they had a government and a society which was total upheaval at the time. With the resources of the Nunn Lugar program, with the expenditure of considerable amount of what could be called political capital, and with the cooperation of Russia, we mounted a truly extraordinary effort. I'm going to give you about a four minute video to give you some insight in how that effort was conducted. Now, during the course of this effort, I visited one of the major sites, major missile sites in Ukraine for different times. To oversee, first to remove the warhead, then to remove the missile, then to blowing up with the silo, and finally, restoring the site to its farming condition. The video, by the way, is made up of clips together from newswields who were presented in Moscow and Kiev. What you've seen here was not presented in the United States. You're seeing newswields that showed in Moscow and Kiev, trying to convince the Russian people that what we were doing was not a danger to them. What would you like to... Can you turn the lights off? Yeah. These are archives from the old Soviet Union Chav, of pyrrngs of the SS-19 missile. This is the missile that was based to Pervomize. Thank you. This is my first visit to Pervomize. They took us into an underground facility where they controlled all these nuclear weapons aimed then at the United States. Then the general took me out and showed me that the warhead had already been taken from the missile. Is the second visit? They're now dismantling the missile. SS-19 missile. Now this is what you'll see is a broadcasting to a multi-broskin. This is the third visit to Pervomize. We go back to that same silo you saw in the first picture. We're going to blow it up. I never imagined that I would be received by an honor guard, I think he had playing the star-spangled banner. Now we're out the missile site. The Russian, Ukrainian and American Ministers' Defense are all ready to blow up that missile. There it goes. Now silos as you may know are built not to be blown up. So we had to get back and check it to make sure we really had gotten it. So after this little ceremony here we walked back to see if the silo had really been destroyed. Here are the three ministers congratulating themselves because it is a destroyed as you will see in a moment. We did a number on that silo. Now this is my fourth and last visit to Pervomize. Now in the meantime the Earth Movers are coming in and straightened out, filled in all that silo. You're not getting sound. Sound up. Sound up. Is the Russian minister of defense, American minister of defense and the Ukrainian minister of defense cultivating our garden as planting sunflowers? That's where the silo was in that first picture. And now six months later that sunflowers really did grow. By the end of my tenure we had dismantled more than 4,000 nuclear weapons in this former Soviet Union as well as another 4,000 in the United States. We destroyed 1,000 launches in the former Soviet Union. Most importantly Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus are now entirely free of nuclear weapons. Well, it was pointed out to me many times in the Congress that most Secretary of Defense were not hired to destroy weapons. They were hired to build them. So eliminating weapons would ininivate the task for an American Secretary of Defense. But being Secretary of Defense also gave me an opportunity to apply management by walking around. I observed that the quality of the U.S. military hinged to a great not only on high technology but on the really astounding quality of our NCO force and non-commissioned officer force. This gave U.S. military a competitive edge over any other military in the world. And therefore I determined I should do everything I could to maintain that quality. I decided I wanted to make a direct contact with the senior and listed people personal, the NCOs and U.S. military. So I arranged for each of the senior and each service had one senior and listed. And they met in my office and we decided what we would do is go to military bases. Every other month we go to different base. And the senior military of the Army say would plan the trip to the Army base. When we got there, the Commanding General would come out, shake our hands, then he would exit stage left. And the sergeant in charge of that base would take over the command for the program for the whole day. While I was there, I talked only with the listed personnel. I know what they were thinking about what their issues were, what their problems were. That was a very insightful, good for me. This is one of the bases I was visiting. The main, one of the principal outputs of that in the discussions was that what they cared about more than anything. First of all, I conclude there was what I called an iron logic between the quality of our military personnel and their quality of life. Because the people, for all the training we did to pay off, the personnel had to stay in and reenlist year after year. But the reason they might have elisted the first place for a number of reasons. The reenlistment was a function of how their families felt their quality of life was. So I had to somehow do something about the quality of life. This was the big issue which everybody I talked with. So we decided, most importantly, what we need to do is get better housing for military personnel. Now, housing is very expensive. I just did not have the resources to do that. So we come up with an innovative approach to housing, which we have plenty of land on military bases. We invited construction companies to come, build on those land, and then lease the houses to the soldiers at the rates which we were able to pay them. That way we avoided the huge capital costs for building. That program, by the way, which was started in 1995 is still going on today and is going to provide tens of thousands of housing units from military personnel. Well, my final day in office was the ceremony. The usual glamour ceremony sang by the Secretary of Defense. But there was a unique part of that ceremony in that the senior enlisted personnel all came forward and presented me with a medal which had never been presented before. And they said to me, you have made more difference in the life of an enlisted man than any other Secretary of Defense in history. That meant more to me than all the other medals that I had gotten. Well, thinking that someday you will be leading a company. I'm going to be leaving you with the advice that the Army's Sergeant Major gave me on my first day in office, the day I took my oath of office. He was speaking about leading military operation. But the advice he gave applies equally well to leading a company's operations. Take care of your troops, he said, and they will take care of you. It's sort of good back to this is your ship. Thank you. I'm up over for questions now. I'll repeat the question. I'll call call if nobody raises their hand. Yes, please. On Wiki, I saw you at a PhD in mathematics. I'm sorry. I'm pretty guilty. So the question is, did you find it useful in your career to have a PhD? So did Dr. Perry find it useful in your career to have a PhD in mathematics? The short answer is yes. I'll qualify that though. I never, when I was Secretary of Defense, I never solved the problem by solving a partial differential equation, which is the subject I wear my thesis in. But I found many times that the analytical way of thinking and approaching problems was a huge asset to me. Moreover, the tools which are developed in management, science, and engineering for doing analytical decision making, even if you cannot, don't have all the numbers, you cannot apply them. The logic of going through those steps are very, very critical, I think, becoming out with, if not analytical decisions, at least objective decisions about the important problem that you're confronted with. I guess one other advantage it gave me, it made it very difficult for the people who were briefing me to snow me on technical issues, which is an occupational hazard for Secretary of Defense. I was wondering if you had any innovative ideas about how the approach to security situation plays, because this managing you can have up in the wall and be conscious, especially with what I've done and my hair, I would, you know, like, be conscious. Yes. So the question has to do with innovative solutions for dealing with the security issues facing the world today. I'll make two comments about that. First of all, when I was a Secretary of Defense, I made a special visit to Pakistan and to India, pleading with them not to test and deploy the nuclear weapons, arguing not so much that it would be bad for the world, which I thought it would be, but I thought it would be make it more dangerous for themselves, or what likely one of those countries itself would be confronted with a nuclear attack. Obviously, I lost that argument. I was not able to persuade not to do it. So Pakistan India did go ahead with a nuclear weapon program. Now we're confronted with several other countries wanting to go nuclear, North Korea and Iran, in particular. If those two countries additionally go nuclear, I think the floodgates are open and we've lost any ability to control nuclear weapons. If that happened, the probability they're being used in our country and in other countries I think it becomes very high. So I think it's a very bad development and I'm still, but I'm still in terms of what to do about it, might actually still try and hold back the proliferation and try to get the major nuclear powers in the United States and Russia to start decreasing the nuclear weapons that they have. Last September, we held a conference here at Stanford, it was hosted by George Schultz who had been the Secretary of State during the Reagan administration. The conference was held on the 20th anniversary of the so-called Reykjavik summit. You probably have not heard of the Reykjavik summit, but a little more than 20 years ago, there was a summit meeting between President Reagan and President Groversoff, the then Soviet Union. And at that meeting, the two presidents actually discussed completely eliminating nuclear weapons and the missiles which delivered them. There was a only time and a major conference that saw where this was even discussed. Now the bad news is that they were not able to come to an agreement. They found it on actual technical details which is I think too bad, but in any event they were not able to come to an agreement and most people consider this Reykjavik summit a failure. But Schultz and I thought the ideas that were advanced at Reykjavik were fundamentally important. And therefore we had this conference on the 20th anniversary to ask the question, can we revive the vision of Reykjavik? And the answer we came up with in that meeting was yes. We followed it up with an op-ed peace in the Wall Street Journal arguing to do that and arguing the steps it needed to be taken in order to get there. Adop-ed peace got very strong and positive response. It was signed by the way by myself, besides Secretary Schultz by myself, Henry Kitsinger and Senator Sam Nguyen. All of whom spent much of their career developing and promoting nuclear weapons. Now these are four people coming out and saying this is a time to totally eliminate the nuclear weapons in the world. And the laid out a series of ten steps that had to be taken to do that. This fall we're going to be having another conference to confirm. The purpose of that conference is to have detailed thoughtful papers on each of those ten steps. What it takes to actually accomplish those steps one at a time. And I'm expecting significant positive results from that meeting. So the short answer to the question is the nuclear danger is greater than ever today and we should continue to re-double our efforts to try to find ways of eliminating nuclear weapons. And the impact stand in India, in North Korea and in the United States and Russia. Please. You will be Secretary of Defense. That's the leadership position that comes with a lot of social responsibility. In general, if someone is a leader of the company, how much do you think it is important for him to have the important responsibility? And if you think that the CEOs of the big companies like Google, HP, you have the important responsibility. How does society or management groom the quality in business? So to one extent, should CEOs of companies assume some social responsibility? And if it is important, how do you develop that capability to execute that social responsibility effect? That's a very good question. My answer to that is that when I was the CEO of a company, I did consider I had a social responsibility not just to my employees, which I felt most strongly, but to the community in which we lived. I think every CEO should take that view. But a CEO is not controlling what all happens in this company. The board and the stockholders ultimately control that. So there has to be a broad of view in the country than there is today of the importance of companies manifesting social responsibility. Some companies do it even without the mandate. And I applaud them. But I also have sympathies with the companies where the CEOs feel they don't have the authority to do that in doubt. This can be manifested in a number of ways, but one of the most obvious today is in the field of environment by mental issues. And I think every company should feel responsibility for that beyond the responsibility that he has to follow because of legal requirements. In the fact, yes. I said it's not only your ship, it's your planet. If you talk about the leadership strategy, is there a climate, companies, and companies or organizations, do you think there are any fundamental differences in the way that you believe in the question? So the question is, are there fundamental differences in the way one leads a for-profit company and a government organization? No, I have spent a part of my life in government, leading government organizations, a part of my life in industry, and becoming a part of my life in the university. And in terms of ethical responsibilities and leadership styles, I found they apply equally to all three. I will go farther than that and say that I think this is one of the few countries in the world where people can move from industry to government and back again, but from university to government back again. I think it's a very good thing because it brings the insights and the special techniques and skills that you learn in government, in industry, into the government. And then when you come back to the industry, it gives you a better feeling for the social responsibilities. So I like very much this, what sometimes is called in a contemptuous way, the revolving door. I think the revolving door is a very positive aspect of our society. But it does require certain regulations to make sure that people have not abused the complex of interest that come from that. Yes, we're in the far left. Clearly, you're like, you're acting like a general, you're pretty credible. You're experiencing the man-feeling, not material, and military research and financing. Like, you help keep positions in that. How do they help people come, take the role as Secretary of Defense, and really help you with things that are such as bonds, and you have some more steep learning curve. That's a great question. I'm not going to be out with me. I paraphrase it. So you talked about the many experiences in industry in other parts of government, and did those experiences prepare you, if you will, for some of the challenges that you faced in Bosnia and Kosovo and some of the other hotspots? Or did you have a very steep learning curve as you came into those situations? During the period between the Director for Defense Research and Engineering, which I left in 1971, and the Secretary of Defense, which I began in 1981, from 1981 to 1993, doing that 12-year period, while I was in venture capital investment banking zone, I was also spending about a third of my time at the Center for International Security here at Stanford. And the background I got there, I found very, very useful when I'm back as the Secretary of Defense. So not only the analytical tools you get from my association with the department here, but the inside and the foreign policy issues, which I got from the Center for International Security here, were very, very helpful to me. But given all of that, when I walked into the job of Secretary of Defense through a host of problems, I had no idea, no background about how to deal with them. And that would be too if you were to move to become the CEO of a new company. You run in the same problem. Product issues, technology issues, people issues that are entirely new to you. And the Secretary of Defense, I found the most important thing for me to do, I mean, the two organs that are in your head, one of them your mouth, one of the ears, use your ears more than you use your mouth. Listen to what other people have to say. Because I was surrounded with the people who had a wealth of background and experience, and you should I had to deal with. I could convening part, I could call a meeting and bring to get all the ten people in the country who had the most expert knowledge of Bosnia, for example. And listen to them, spend the whole day listening to them and talking to them, exchanging views of them. You could do that with technical issues as well. And what was most difficult for me was trying to get on top of the geopolitical and geopolitical and cultural issues of the different countries we were dealing with, Haiti, or Wanda, Bosnia, Kosovo. All of these were issues which I had very little knowledge of background. So the general approach is, spend, use your convening part to bring in the people who have the background and experience, and listen carefully to them and discuss issues with them. And that insight will help you. In terms of military skills, of course we had some of the best military people in the world. Now the Secretary of Defense by the U.S. laws and constitution is in charge of the military. We have civilian control of the military in our country. But if you stop to think about it, my greatest rank when I was in the Army was second lieutenant. And it occurred to me that some of the generals who were working with me might know more about military issues than I did. So again, it's a matter of having the good sense to listen to them, to seek them out, ask their advice, ask their opinions. I'm applying that to the Secretary of Defense. U.S. also will be true to you if you move into a job as a CEO of a new company. What career advice would you be with us? I don't think I can give a specific, I think, a question to general. I don't know how to do it specifically. Okay. One more here and then over there. Yes. Well, I'm a hard-working, fundamental person who knows you when you were working in the U.S. Okay. So how did the DOD notice Dr. Perry when he was working in DSL? You wanting to get noticed by DOD? Yes. Okay. About half of our contracts of Department of Defense were with the DSL or with the Defense Department. And so I met people at that time, but beyond that, and probably more importantly than that, because of my technical background, I was called in as an advisor to the Defense Department. In particular to the member of the Defense Science Board, which, and that, I really got to know people more through my advising and consulting role than I did through my company role. For example, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, because I had a special background and expertise in the Soviet missiles. As soon as they discovered Soviet missile-beany-flowing Cuba, I was called and asked to come back and work on the team that day by day analyzed what was happening there. So I got very close to the people who, in the military, who were responsible for working on those problems. One of the people I was particularly concerned to was Harold Brown, who was, at that time, the Director of Defense Research in Engineering. And then in 1976, when President Carter was elected, he picked Harold Brown to be a Secretary of Defense. Harold Brown knew me from the day I was advising consulting him. He called me up and asked me to come back and be Director of Defense Research. The job he used to have, which was research in engineering. So really my contact with that was more through my consultant work than what's in my company work, and then in the job of Director of Defense Research in engineering, I got to know all the people who later on asked me to become the Secretary of Defense. When I came back to Stanford after being Secretary of Defense, the math department asked me if I would come and speak at their graduation ceremony. And I said, fine, what do you want me to talk about? I said, explain how it is you go from a PhD in mathematics to Secretary of Defense. And I said, the one sentence answered that question is, I got there by a random walk process. And it's sort of good, but also the question you were asking, it's hard to give career advice because the career I ended up with is one I never planned. I started off to get a PhD in mathematics because I was going to be a mathematics professor. Most people were getting a PhD in mathematics. I think they want to be a mathematics professor. But I got diverted along the way by a number of things. I never, never, ever intended to go into government. And I was drafted and I really hated to give up my company and go into government. And I just seemed like something I had to do. During your undergraduate career at Stanford and DSD work at Penn State, what were the main leadership roles you undertook? And did those experience from those leadership roles? Do you think right now they help you later in your career? And my second question is, during which phase of your career you felt the most stressful? You are walking too much and you are stressed out. Okay, so two questions. The first is, did you have any leadership roles? Either as an undergraduate or master student here at Stanford or during your PhD program at Penn State? And if so, how did those leadership experiences a student prepare you for your future? And the second one, which actually all of us are wondering about, is what was the most stressful period during your career? Right, just that. The answer to the first question is no except I was a teaching assistant. And not only that, but at Stanford in those days I was able to actually teach classes. So I actually taught classes when I was still working on a master's degree at Stanford. And I did also when I was working on my PhD. So I wasn't just a teaching assistant, I actually had a lecture at classes. And there's a certain amount of leadership involved in teaching. It's not the same thing, but it's the usual discipline there. Second question and the most stressful. I think I should first of all say that in both of these government jobs I had, the Director of Defense Research and Engineering and the Secretary of Defense. I found them enormously fulfilling. I enjoyed what I was doing all the time. They were all sort of 24 or 7 jobs, but all the time I was doing things I thought was important and worthwhile and interesting. So it was not tiring a stressful, an important view. There were a few stressful situations which sort of came with the job. Every week I would sign deployment orders. The only person that can send Army, Navy, Marine, Air Force people to overseas is the Secretary of Defense. It's not done by the President, it's not done by the Artifacty Army or anybody. It's done by the Secretary of Defense or every week I would sign those. And there were always objective theoretical reasons for sending people into dangerous missions. But I also wanted to be fully grounded as to what that meant on a human basis besides an objective base. So the discipline I had gave myself was that every time something would go amiss and it would be a casket coming back to Andrew's Air Force base, I would go out to meet that and talk with the family and explain to them why their son or daughter have been put in this dangerous mission. Now it not only helped the families to do that but it helped me because it kept me grounded on the fact that whatever the objective reason for sending people overseas, there's a very real human element there as well. The single most stressful incident I ever had though was when one of our airplanes accidentally shot down one of our helicopters, about 20 people in it, they were all killed. And I had first of all the tasks that were going to go and telling the President that had happened. It was like if I had kicked him in this stomach when I told him that. And then to go and meet with the families and explain to them not just why their son or daughter had died, but why had died as a result of an American pilot shooting it down. I think of all of the phrase that you hear friendly fire doesn't really capture the emotion and the drama of how really upsetting it is when we kill one of our own people. Accidentally of course it never less had happened. There's always a very detailed investigation that's what happened. And the investigation always turns out the same way as other accidents happen, which is the system is always designed so there's a four or five safeguards so it won't happen. And so when something really bad like that happened it means all four or five of them have simultaneously failed. You can figure out the probability that happened if you know the probability of each one of the events. And so it doesn't happen very often. You get compound probability of that, but they do happen occasionally. And then after the act acts and the investigation determines that fact then you need to determine what can you do to raise the probability to lower the probability even more than it is already. How can you change your process procedures so that a human error here or an equipment failure there will not be the weak link in the chain? It's very patient. So what extent do you think cross-cultural understanding between individuals can make a difference? So what extent can cross-cultural understanding between individuals make a difference? I found that very, very important. During the time in the German Secretary of Defense I went to visit the 67 countries. I met with the Ministry of Defense, the prime ministers, the kings, whoever they were in that case. I met with all of them in 67 different countries. And each of them came to visit me in Washington at least once. So I had many, many discussions with the Russian Defense Minister, whom you saw in that picture. I probably met with him a dozen times when I was Secretary of Defense. Now, I speak no Russian and he speaks no English. So that complicates the understand right away. I had many meetings with the Chinese Minister of Defense. And again, I speak not to speak Chinese, he did not speak English. The first mechanical part of the problem is solved for us because we were ministers and defense. That we can afford and get the world's best translate interpreters. So I would be speaking with the Russian Minister of Defense. I would say something to him and he would answer me right back because he had somebody standing beside him whispering in his ear in real time what I was saying and similarly with me. There were only a few interpreters who were that good. But when you get interpreters that good, you lose the illusion. You have the illusion actually that you're actually speaking directly with a person. So that's one barrier removed. The cultural understanding though is much more difficult to come by. And every time you tried to visit a country that was new to me, whether it was particularly important to me, I would call in the first half day all of the government people who were acting in that subject, the central intelligence agency, the state department of people, all of the Chinese experts to get their detailed briefings on what I should say thought I should know about this. And then that afternoon, I would, an evening, I would call in all this civilian university, spatulas in that field, the most into them. So from them, you, from the experts, you begin to get a feeling for what are the important cultural issues. Some of them are kind of trivial like the things they say you should not do because this country's spatial customs. Some of those are important. They're not as important. I think it's people think because people don't expect an American sectorate defense to know every detail, customer of their country. But to a few that are important and you really get those down. So cultural understanding is important. It just takes a lot of time. And since you're trying to do it for 67 countries, you don't have that much time. And so you try to distill it by getting experts in those fields to come and speak with you and talk to you. Transfer some of their wisdom and experience gained from decades of study on this subject to you and maybe a two or three out of discussion. In the back, yes. I think you asked what is the biggest challenge that he encountered and how did he solve it? I think there were two quite different challenges. I can't do it down to one. One of them, I just, I tried to describe to you in the video I showed you. The one biggest challenge was getting trying to get the nuclear danger under control. There was thousands and thousands of nuclear weapons that had a deadly legacy of the Cold War. And now a danger to us in a different way. And trying to get that under control was certainly one of the biggest challenges I had. And I spent a lot of my time in energies on that. The other was how do you achieve policy goals in the United States without going to war? How do you use the incredible military capability of the United States without having to use it? How do you get the benefit of the military capability of the United States without having to actually going to war, going to take military actions? This means you have to work very closely with the people in the country charged with the diplomacy. Because between speaking nicely to a country and going to war with a country, there's an intermediate ground that's called coercive diplomacy. Where you speak with a velvet hand and velvet love in one hand and an iron fist in the other hand. I think this is what we'd like to do with you and this is what we would do for you if you can accommodate us. And this is what happens if you don't. And a very simple example of that was with North Korea. I went to Pyongyang a number of years ago. I now out of office as a secretary's defense would have been asked to come back and deal with it in the nuclear problem in North Korea. I went to North Korea and it wasn't just coercing them about the nuclear weapons they have. It was presenting to them the positive ways that the good things that could happen to them if they were willing to give up the nuclear weapons. The economic benefits. The trade with South Korea, the trade with Japan, the economic assistance in the United States could give them. The representation in the United States would give them. All of these things were posed to them in a positive way. So, as I always seem to be the good diplomacy is a mixture of the positive and the negative. And when you only focus on the negative, which is what the military can do, you miss the main benefit of it. So the trick is somehow blending the two of those together, which means you're radically doing something which is very difficult getting the state department and the defense department to work together. But it really needs to be done. Thank you. One last question. Sir. From a business point of view, there's always a question about how do you manage a huge federal bureaucracy? And there's been an evolutionary change I understand over the last 30 years of outsourcing, non-combative functions in the military. And my question is, how much did you have to do with that change? And is it a good thing? So how much did Dr. Perry have to do with the outsourcing of non-combat functions from the military to civilian contractors? And has it been a good thing? I think it's a mixed bag. I do not have a simple answer to that question. I worked very hard to get the government out of the business, for example, of building integrated circuits. Which we were very much in when I became a secretary. We weren't very good at doing it, and they were very expensive. I worked very hard to get the government to use civilian products and civilian contractors whenever it was indeed feasible. I didn't know any way that I could be a secretary of defense to make a case by case a judgment of that. So the first day I went to office as a secretary of defense, I wrote a directive. And it dealt with the fact that up until then, these decisions were made by government program manager. The government program manager, however, had certain restrictions, obviously had legal restrictions, but he also had restrictions that said, whenever if you want to use a commercial product or a commercial service, you have to get a waiver to do that. You have to do a formal process going up the line to do that. It turns out that's a very complex and time consuming process to get that waiver, so not many people did it. So my director simply changed it slightly. I guess slightly, if you want to use a military developed product, you have to get a waiver to do it. So that the presumption was that the program manager, whenever it was feasible, would use commercial products, which would generally be much cheaper. And most of the program managers would have to take advantage of that to free them and save a lot of money. That's one very simple example. The integrated circuits that were being built to military specifications, there are days cost literally 10 times as much as a comfortable circuit in the commercial field. So it was a huge savings, making that one simple change in the directive. Now, having said that, I would say it has now been used, not just for product but for services as well, including services provided to our forces at war, including guard services and MP services. I have very mixed feelings about that. I think, for example, part of the tragedy of Abu Ghraib was because of the contractors that were involved without sufficient oversight and supervision. It was more complicated than that, but that was just one of the problems. So all in all, I'm very hesitant about using this for services as opposed to products. And particularly services during wartime, whether you oversight is not as thorough as it might otherwise be. Thank you. It was good to talk to you today.
