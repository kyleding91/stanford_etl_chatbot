 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Without further ado, I'd like to introduce Thomas Prescott. Thomas? Thank you. Thank you. First, Tom. Thank you. Boy, it's great to be here today and I'm thrilled. A lot of IQ and energy and interest. And whenever I get a chance to interact with whether kids are in grade school or junior high or high school, college talking about science and entrepreneurship in the future, it reminds me why we work so hard because at the point where you are in its Darth Vader, I'm assimilating you. You're now corporate America. No. It reminds me that everything is still possible and that's the wonderful plate you've got in front of you for the rest of your life. So it's really my honor to be here today. One quick survey while we're here. A range of students and faculty and others. How many of you ever had braces? Raise your hands. All right. Scientific survey. More than 50%. How many of you loved it? Someone loved it. Obviously, you know, why'd you love it? I felt like it was in the club once I got it. You got in the club. You were official. You got your team colors on it. It was great until you went home and all you could eat is soup. I will tell you, a line technology. We're here to do a couple of things with you today and with your four parents. My agenda is just to organize to keep me on track and you've got a lot of things to do. I'm going to give you a bless you. I'm going to give you snapshots of a great Silicon Valley success story, a Stanford success story, and an innovation and entrepreneurship success story. I'm also going to give you a few observations. I'm not qualified to teach leadership or to tell you the right way to do it. I'll just share with you a few observations what I'll call a few tenets of leadership and management. And then finally, I want to share with you a little of my thinking about the headwinds in the medical device industry. I think a critical Medtech and Biotech, a very critical part of our future for all humanity, as well as certainly one of the bullworks of American entrepreneurship and innovation that we've exported globally. So with that, how many of you had heard about in this line before the Clear braces company? This company was, you may know many things about it and you probably think of it as a piece of plastic. But it's many things but mostly a line technology is an engineering marvel. And the little piece of plastic that represents the aligners. In fact, I should ask anybody here a patient in treatment? Boy, not much market penetration. One person, you see the opportunity we have here. So when the venture guys ask you how big your market is, there we are. Maybe 80 people, one and a quarter percent penetration we'll call for this slice of market. But a line technology came into being as an impossible idea. Like many of the things you play around with. I love the contest. And today, you're looking at an environment where everything's still possible, but many things are harder. So go back to what you think about. What was going on in 1997 at Stanford, at the Graduate Business School? What would be a couple of differences in your minds? Just jump out. Different from today from 1997. One thing. Sorry. No, never mind. That doesn't count. Next. Somebody jump in. What's different today? One thing. Yes. Social networking. Social networking. Think about, we didn't even think what that meant. It was maybe classmates.com or something like that. What else? What else was going on? I'm sorry? Over there? The dot com bubble hasn't happened yet. The dot com bubble. Come back to it. Yes. Iphone, so I can buy it. Iphone's in all this I apps, everything. So I'm going to jump on this for a minute. The bubble was still a bubble. It hadn't popped. So before that bubble popped, what was going on, saying the financing community, was there more or less available funding than today? Way more. Way more. Way more. You got it. So think about two graduate students at Stanford. And I take my hat off to them. Zia Shisti and Kelsey Worth, that had this idea. And yet they went up and down Sand Hill Road, not far from here. And everybody said, no, you're crazy. Two wild eyed Stanford students with an idea that you could somehow get away from braces and brackets and wires. And a client or Perkins, here's an ad for them, said, now this is crazy idea. But I'll give you a little bit of money if you can solve these, answer these three or four questions. And they did that. And they came back and got them connected with a few medical schools in orthodontic departments. And they answered a few more questions. And that ultimately led to a pretty fast pace cycle of financing and tackling big technological problems. Because know what people could use pieces of plastic to move teeth or retain teeth. But know what I'd ever imagine how you might use technology to make this more systematic using computers and 20 to 32 3D objects in the mouth with no reference frame. And then the manufacturing technology to enable this. And so on five or six or seven fronts, it was basically impossible. And there were no technologies out there in the world that anybody could find that could actually do that. Even if you repurposed best in class technology. So this became quickly a financing and race to solve technology problems so you could actually develop a product and bring it to market. At the core of line technology is technology and innovation. And while you may think of us as a consumer company today, we've certainly pioneered in the dental industry. The ability for a smaller company to create brand awareness and mobilize consumers and ask for a product by name, which is a new dynamic. But the bigger innovation in the company was underscoring the technology. They innovated. We innovated. Much this was done before I came in early of 2002. But the innovative new processes and technology to personalize each treatment, each patient treatment with a class two medical device. And those of you that hang around the medical school or biomedical engineering understand that's not trivial. Certainly today it wasn't back then. We've become the global leader in mass customization and imagine how personal this is. It fits in you. And if it doesn't fit perfectly and doesn't do the job, you're going to take it out. Again, the only way compliance happens is if you want to wear it and you see progress. And every one of these aligners, every one of these treatments has to fit you perfectly or it doesn't work. We make over 40,000, we don't make any standard parts. Every part we make in a demand flow manufacturing system is completely unique with no standards. You know, kind of microns of fit and conformance. And yet everyone is unique because everybody's mouth is different. Everybody's a natomy physiology and treatment is different. And we have to accommodate how the orthodontist or dentist wants to pursue that treatment within some clinical standards. So the company basically did this. We've made now over 60 million completely unique. And this is not an advertisement, but I'm highly proud of our team that's done this. And since you're talking about entrepreneurship and innovation and we're sitting here in one of the best engineering schools in the country, you guys can appreciate what that meant and what it took. 60 million completely unique class two medical devices. And now over a million three patients in treatment are finished. We continue to have 90% plus a very or extremely satisfied marks from the patient. So we're just getting started. You saw a minute ago where a really small share, at least this slice. And again, you come across, you see how amazing the technology we've created to do it. And so at the core of it is intellectual property and novel innovation. But you're looking now at something that looks very easy. I'd like to take you back a little bit. And we're going to come back and talk about this, I guess. And before I do that, I'd like to maybe, and I'm on video, I realize there's a risk of this as being preserved for all. But I need to do full disclosure. Two things. When I looked at the flyer, that's an older photo. I clearly, there's truth in advertising here. That's probably a four or five year old video, more gray hair, etc. The second thing is, I'm a failed entrepreneur. The only company I ever started up failed. And remember, they always fired the sales and marketing guy first. That was me. So we did a company back in 1985, 86 for early optical disc storage and applications on a factory floor. I had come out of factory automation. And it was a great idea until we had one customer doing a pilot project. They were called GM. And if you ever do your history, that was the end of Roger Smith. So GM got a cold. All their suppliers got pneumonia or died. And yes, the answer is yes, we died. We didn't go. So as I look around at potential entrepreneurs and tip my hat to entrepreneurs, many of them failed in many things. And so I don't know whether you read Thomas Edison or somebody else, whether it's experiments or anything else. There's more failure than there is success. But failure is an outcome and you learn a lot from it. So with that kind of full disclosure about me personally, I've had the pleasure of coming in and working with, coming in behind, and working alongside multiple founders. And in most every case, I've had enduring great relationships with founders. And Stephen and I were talking briefly. And what's the difference between an operating hack like me and a true entrepreneur? And the answer is a few things. One, it's life experience and skills. And then two, it's, I would probably, I might pursue a big bet as an operating type. And I would have plans and a rational rationale for doing that. But I'm not as likely to go after a wild crazy idea that's totally disruptive. And so once somebody does that, maybe they can't scale that business or it's not growing fast enough or there's some other problems. And somebody like me can be a good compliment to that. It's not often that a great entrepreneur can be a great operating person. There are exceptions. But I have the greatest admiration for the true entrepreneurs that have figured out a way to create something truly disruptive. The challenge is how many of those companies that create this new thing, this new segment, whether it's in social media, how many of the early movers there really got to gain that? Facebook certainly won. But in looking at any new space where somebody has come out with a disruptive new idea or new technology, how many of those early movers really get a chance to capture most of the profit from that new space? So how many of iPhones or let's call it a fancy MP? How many had MP3 players before you had your iPhone or iTunes or anything like that? What happened to all those guys? So see Apple thought of something completely better, bigger, more complete. We never knew we needed that until they did. We never knew we needed the iPhone and all the apps ecosystem before we did that. But the original players in many spaces don't get to capture all of the profit. And so young companies that go through startups have great opportunities to go not only innovate, but then you got a race to try and continue that innovation cycle and start to scale your business. So you have a chance of actually creating business success. So aligned technology, I'm going to step you through a couple of stages. I'll say the startup through real growing pains and early in 97, Zia and Kelsey were at Stanford Business School getting their masters, their MBAs. And they thought there had to be a better way. They came up with this idea. They actually got a little bit of seed money. The company was formed in April of 1997. It was followed by an A round, a pretty good size A round of financing in the summer. And they went ripping off on solving problems, imagining technologies and starting to think about how they could actually bring a product like this to market. The product actually came to market and it was first product was shipped in August of 99. There was a lot that happened between then, including several financing. All in before we made a profit, the company raised $280 million. Now do you think that's likely today? And so I think there's shaking no way. There's much more pressure on companies with very big ideas that require a lot of capital to enable them. And so virtual models, you've had some great speakers in here talking about virtual models and different ways to do this. And I think a few companies are going to have the capability to raise those kinds of dollars. And I don't know that you could have done what these guys did in today's environment with the access to capital that was back then versus what it is today. But that said, they did a fabulous job of that. They had a first class group of folks here, many from Stanford, computational labs, some of the same DNA that went into some of these great companies in the valley. And they were solving enormously difficult 3D geometry problems and manufacturing technology problems. And with all the kind of dog years of work that you can imagine went into that. Well, I'll take this out to 2002 when I came in company was shipping product, but we were not what I'll call successful operationally. We were not capable. The right case wasn't going to the right office. The product didn't always fit perfectly. Our customer service wasn't very good. And we had a new dynamic emerge to scale. Finding scarce computer kind of 3D CAD CAM skills, a Zia who had deep Pakistani roots had gone to Pakistan and set up an operation there where we could scale in a cost effective way. And then what happened in September of 2001 911. It became very difficult for us to continue to scale that facility, bring Westerners over there, drive process improvement and everything else. And the company was struggling to continue to grow and scale running out of money. And what happens when that goes on in startup companies? What are the board starts saying? What do we do? Should we think about a new CEO with more experience and everything else? I wasn't there for those discussions. And I was really coming out of what I'll say more clinically intense med tech, interventional cardiology, respiratory, patient safety monitoring. I loved health care and I loved the mission directed nature that health care businesses and med tech businesses had. But and I thought you want to go see this dental company. I thought dentistry. You know gosh, it didn't seem like it was clinically intense. When I came down to a line, I saw amazing people, great technology and a wonderful opportunity, but some significant problems. I came aboard in March. We looked at the whole business, decided we had to be more focused with our choices and what we were doing. We cut our burn rate. We raised a little bit of money and we actually turned cash flow positive in 2003. Along the way we made the decision that we had to exit Pakistan, we moved some of that operation to Costa Rica. Zia ultimately left the board. And we've had we had a we basically started doing fewer things that pissed off customers. You know, it's a long list of things that when you're not operating well, you can go right down that list and fix those. So what's the old story when you're in a hole? Don't keep digging. So step by the hole. We basically just started running the business more sensibly and taking care of the basic stuff. So that was kind of the the startup, the scramble, the financing and the first commercialization in growth of the company. By the end of 2004, we are about 140, 150 million in revenue and growing nicely again, 30, 40% a year. And what happens when everything starts going well in a company? Everybody gets sick. Yeah, no, what happens when everything goes when everything's going well, what about in your personal life, everything's going perfect, you assume it's going to be great forever, right? So maybe you relax and companies are like any organization. They when people don't keep pressing into something, keeping your eyes on the horizon for the bigger thing, start to relax. And guess what, you got an inflection point and you start getting less focused. Your execution isn't as good and the time you should press the most is when you're doing the best, right? That's when you can press advantage, whether it's technology, market, your organization. And so we we ran into a few execution challenges and then lo and behold, one of our founders showed up again. I'll just say we have a rich history and we wound up in lots of litigation for a couple years. And you know what doesn't, Nietzsche was right, what doesn't destroy you or kill you makes you stronger. Ultimately adversity is a good thing in nature, in the marketplace, in competition for innovation. And we went through a couple cycles, but through that process, we went through some very challenging times. And I've included this bringing out through 2008, because we all know what happened in the meltdown. Just when we were getting our act back together, we after competitive threats were mostly dissipated, the whole the whole world went crazy and consumers went into a shell and our customers were freaked out. And we were all collectively saying what happens next. So what happens when when everything else goes wrong, you step back and take a very sober look at your prospects and your opportunities. And we did that and we put a turnaround plan together took some cost of the business got refocused and through that period, we've really been scaling the business and came through the downturn actually grew. We took 20, 25 million dollars of cost of the business made some hard choices to focus on fewer priorities and have exited that cycle doing pretty well. I'd say right now it's a pretty choppy economy and you work through the time you're in, but the phase we're in right now is basically scaling to make sure we stay that we created this new space. We innovated and pioneered clear orthodontics. Our goal now is to be the leader and we really only have about 3% share of the existing starts just in North America alone. Those starts with orthodontists. So we got very small share. We got an opportunity to switch over the whole world to clear liners who would want braces. We'll help you feel like you're in the club, give you something else. But at every stage of a company there are very different challenges and you can learn much from what we've been through. Hopefully vicariously soon enough to repeat it. I'll stop there. I've given you kind of a speed review of our history and I'm happy to take questions in real time here. I have a few other ideas I'll throw on the table. But what questions do you guys have about the stages? Yes. Sure. Sure. I'll keep them instead of the typical three we normally ask since MSN178 is wrapped around this class and you've been kind enough to volunteer to come into it. I won't use up our magic three. I'll just use one. And I think the most interesting question is kind of boiled down to what is the interface between the founder and the new operating guy who comes in? Are there expectations that are kind of unsaid or not said or what do you wish would happen to make that better? I mean implicitly that's a loaded question on purpose. Thanks. I'm putting up to the class. Sure. I would say again I've with the exception of one founder I've got great relationships with many founders I've worked alongside three or four. What I'd say first of all is you need a mature relationship and you need to recognize there's different life experiences skills orientation and if you can do it right they ought to compliment and not compete. Now that requires emotional maturity on the operating person that says or everything here was bad. You need to fix it versus saying boy this is amazing. I can see a lot of ways it can be better. Are there sacred cows? Are there some other things that are very important to you as founder? Oftentimes founders remain on the board and that's still maintained. It's an important relationship. On the case of the founder many founders it's your child. You can't imagine seeing it other than how you see it. So it requires some emotional maturity from the founder to develop that working relationship with the operator. In the best case you have a board that is having open dialogue about this. You have a founder that really cares most about the company being successful. The operator that is able to leverage their skills but is respectful and appreciative of the fact they wouldn't have given birth to this wonderful thing called this new company creating jobs and opportunities for a lot of other people. There's a lot of one of the presentations and I know a few of the individuals that have characterized this is Shakespeare and Hamlet and others. There's plenty of drama and Silicon Valley about startups and founders being moved out and all that stuff. I would assert that it doesn't have to be that difficult. If you're thinking about starting up a company think about where it evolves. Imagine success. I do that personally. I visualize the outcome I want. Whether it's three years, five years. Then I imagine where my skills won't fit anymore. I personally don't run a run of five billion dollar company. It's too far away from customers and employees and the magic of innovation for me to get really excited about that. For me to think about this business if I'm here five more years and were billions in revenue, it's less interesting for me and I wouldn't be as passionate. I have to start thinking about either the head or the board does it for me. When would be the right time for me to be thinking about somebody else that loves running a two billion dollar company taking it to five because the work you do is different. I think it's the same thing for each of you that are starting companies and if they're virtual, it may be different. You may not have a successor, an operator. You may be able to rely on the ecosystem around you and some of the people that in virtual space can complement what your skills and experiences are. But I just I believe life is too short and you ought to have open honest discussions and if the operators coming into a situation where the founder doesn't agree and the board doesn't agree, then I'd say that's not a situation. The operating type would say I'm not sure this is the right thing for me. I personally don't like to drop into situations like that. Let's open it up to the client. Sure. Any other questions? Yes. I'm interested in knowing how the market penetration process was because you weren't competing with some other businesses and the new product was new type. So how easy or hard was it to convince the doctors to employ this and what kind of resources was necessary to do with it? Sure. I'm going to try very hard to play back the question and if I don't get it right, you're going to help me. I think there was a three part here. The first is interested in market penetration. How hard was it to get doctors to believe in and start to adopt and then three, what kind of resources went into that? Was that pretty close? All right. It's hard. If medical advice industry, whether it's a dentist or a doctor in a specialty, they're looking for proof, clinical evidence, white papers, clinical studies in some cases. In the early days, a line didn't have that. One of the reasons they went out quickly to consumers was to say, boy, who would really want braces? They had a great value proposition, but the problem was especially orthodontist, it was almost dogmatic. Everything they did was brackets and wires. So the job they had to do was explain them, give them the clinical reasons, the economic reasons, and all the other reasons why they would say, you should trust us with part of your practice to at least start trying this. And the company wasn't really set to do that. They didn't have a lot of people in the early days that understood clinical development and innovation inside Medtech and why doctors make choices. So they went to the consumer and it was exciting for a young private company to run a $30 million ad campaign. There was a lot of buzz, but very little that translated into case starts for a line. It turned into a lot of case starts for the brackets manufacturers. They should have at least done his Christmas cards. The company basically had to retrench a bit, provide the reasons to believe, clinical evidence, and a lot of science. And we're still doing that. The consumer has far greater demand for this product than the channel, our GP Dennis and orthodontist, who would still probably rather default with a little bit of, there's a group of committed champions here, maybe a third of the orthodontist out there, but many of them are more comfortable using traditional approaches. So you got to invest in clinical studies. Trade shows, a lot of clinical education. We have an award-winning website where we have a lot of CE content and bring them along, give them a reason to change. The other thing that happens in dentistry is how many of you are in biomedical or Medtech or other areas in engineering? What's one thing say cardiac surgery or an unimensional cardiology versus dentistry? What would be one big difference? The payer, yes, private pay, that's a big difference. How about morbidity mortality? Anybody here if somebody dying from a dental procedure? If it happens, you probably got very bad care. But the very low morbidity mortality in dentistry and orthodontic specialty and the very fragmented nature and private pay means they're slower to change. If a big change occurs in interventional cardiology, let's use stents. The change is within a quarter or two, you would see most people using what's now considered a standard of care based on very clear clinical evidence. It was almost irresponsible to stay with old technology if it was proven that there's greater morbidity and mortality. We're going to test that when the government's the payer and say, we don't care so much about that. Back to your original reason, this is why it's taken a longer time, we're still working on it. The company spends a lot of money on clinical research, on sales and marketing and all those things. I'd say we're still in the first or second inning of that adoption and market share is still very small. Other questions? Yes. What's it like running a company that has a very physical product in a place like Silicon Valley where there's computer startups going at 10,000 miles an hour everywhere and you guys have to like physically go out and meet with people that you're going to be working with? Another question is what's it like? We're living in the Silicon Valley where things move at breakneck pace and it's electronic world and you can reach customers in a virtual space, in a parallel universe without a real economy without ever seeing them. Yet we've got a real physical product, we have to deliver on it. For me, it's a great thing personally because again, I am passionate about medical devices and healthcare and having a purpose based company, very mission focused where we can do well and yet see how people are so excited. We don't save lives in this part of our MedTech but we really change lives. A beautiful smile for somebody that never could smile or feel good about themselves is really a big deal. I, frankly, underestimated that when I came here. I was used to life-saving technology. This is life-changing. For me, I would probably have a harder time in a virtual world because I get kind of renewed by all the stories and seeing patients and doctors out there with people that we've touched. So for me, medical devices, healthcare is a passion more than it is a kind of a job. It pays pretty well too. Yes. You have a Facebook fan page, you have a chance to see it. We do, we do. You're not a teen. I'd also point you to InvisalignTeen.com. That feels creepy but we do. We have a lot of social, back to the question about social networking. We have a very viral kind of product, when you have a very honest offering and it resonates with your consumer and the value proposition, when you knock it out of the park all the time, we've got some very passionate fans that love to talk. One of the things we see today with, frankly, your generation and those younger than you is, you're on self-produced content. You don't rely on somebody else's content and you're telling your own story. So we're trying to enable that with all the digital social media environment and ecosystem and we're doing a pretty good job. Yes. So how would you say the culture changed when you came into your company and now what's the fundamental change in culture and the people there? Sure. So the question was what has changed with the culture since I came in. What I would say, what I would hope, and it's not just me, it's bringing in another team and bringing in people that commit to the core values, I would say the core values of this company haven't changed. The DNA of the founders will always be in a company and I think that's a good thing and you shouldn't dodge that. You see the base of technology we created and that's a wonderful blessing. But also the passion for our customers and their patients is there as well. So the right kind of place to work. Now we don't quite have the campus of a Google or whatever but our employees are there on weekends and they're doing it because they believe in it and they want to take it to the next level. And I think now you layer on, do you have, when employees run out of gas it's because you work really hard and you don't get things done. So now if you can add kind of basic stuff to consistently execute well that progress, that kind of winning kind of re-energizes the team. So I do think though in any company you have a stated culture you can find it on the wall or a card and then you see the invisible culture. And a lot of times the things we don't like about where we are or where we work are that invisible side. And I think it's really important to be honest about that. Here's what we say but here's what we really do. And a lot of times those norms are more powerful in a company. Gee we like open discussion yet you never have arguments right. It always happens in the hallway or whatever. So I think when you guys are out if you're talking to companies and getting jobs, are there any jobs available? Go figure out what the real culture is otherwise what they say. There's always the intended culture and the unintentional culture that's out there in a business. I hope we've made it a bit better and it's built on what they had. Other questions yes? How is your difficulty of being an approval from the food and drug administration in order to launch a new medical device into the market? I'm going to come to that in a minute. The question is how difficult is it working with the food and drug administration and other bodies outside the US to get approval to launch commercialized a new medical device? It's really hard right now. And I you guys have had Josh MacGour and here not too long ago he's been in a few times. He's a great entrepreneur and serial founder. I just spent some time with him last weekend at a meeting. It is very hard right now and what's more difficult is it's moving. And so what happens when there's uncertainty when what appears to be political policy is both being played out through heightened regulatory action and that appears that can appear to be arbitrary sometimes. And then when new rules are coming in and how they'll be implemented is not clear. That's all the way from CMS where they're determining reimbursement and payment all the way through FDA and clinical trials and all that. So for a founder for a VC firm and for the other actors in a young company this is very destabilizing and most VCs I know have backed away from big idea opportunities because the capital isn't available for it. And the risks are too high right now and that's a huge problem. It's a huge problem. But I believe we're going to work through it. There needs to be certainty about what the process is and then you can figure out what you can do with it. A couple other questions maybe on this. Yes in the back. So you're at orthodontia which field of medical technology do you foresee will be prominent in the upcoming decades? Boy the question was we're playing in dentistry right now in orthodontics. What do I think is going to be really prominent. You know there's some obvious technology gaps in the traditional way medical devices have come about is a clinician that's really smart is saying there's got to be a better way to do this. This is an unmet patient need people are dying or they certainly aren't getting well or you have chronic diseases that just linger and you have engineers that are thinking of the same thing and they get together and figure out a way. I think there is so there's going to be convergence in the next five 10 15 years of I believe today's medical device technology with an original clinical focus patient problem unmet need. And my hope is that with just as convergence has happened in some other areas of the technology world multiple technologies getting together and shifting the curve I think there's a great opportunity in medical devices sitting here today the obvious places where innovation is rewarded are for the big disease states you know interventional cardiology. And there's a whole class of problems from atrial fibrillation to still sudden cardiac death and things like that there's huge problems with you know what's called COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which is just you know a terrible way to waste what emphysema and all that and we've got all the you know 60% of the population is going to wind up with type 2 diabetes. So what I'd say there are enormous problems and enormous opportunities but I my hope is that the traditional strength of medical devices will continue and we will bring a whole new way to get them to be more cost effective and be able to prove that the system can afford that intervention because it'll eliminate the need for a bill to prove that eliminate the need for a long term chronic disease state. I would say go figure out what what the most expensive problems are diabetes is clearly going to be one of them heart failure is going to be one of them sudden cardiac death and certainly cancer cancers of all types have been around we're still not smart enough about how to apply even the best in class drugs today and I think there are a handful of really amazing companies in this valley working on very targeted therapeutics you know why should a one class of the best class of of the treatments for breast cancer only work on you know 20% of the women and and they endure all the side effects and yet they don't really work in six months later you know you've got bigger problems we should know what will work what therapeutic regimen will work on individual patients so I'm actually it's a hard time but I'm very optimistic about the long term if we don't kill the golden goose. I didn't answer your question sorry there's lots of big problems out there sorry. Maybe one more question or not I'll move on yes. Just kind of follow on to that do you see this kind of innovation in the pharmaceutical industry? The question is do I see innovation in the pharmaceutical industry you know I'm I when I moved into medical technology out of fact got a mission it was after I I had a startup that failed and I was trying to think about I was kind of answering her question for myself what's going to be hot for the next 20 30 years I need to learn more about being a better leader and a manager and I and I want to find a segment the economy that doesn't go through the business cycle. The same that I had seen broad based industry and I back then we didn't exactly have Google the internet wasn't around and so you'd go to the library and spend time micro fish and SAP you know S&P reports and all that stuff. What took weeks probably could do in 30 minutes today but the upshot was I looked at health care and medical technology and I decided not to go after pharma so long way of me saying I don't think I'm qualified to answer what pharma what I do see. What I do see happening is they're moving over from classic pharma into biotech and they're moving into generics and they're finding ways to find low cost environments where they can bring a therapeutic regimen. One of our board members is was a number two guy to M. Jen and and they work very hard but it's very expensive what they do for biologics and you know I don't know what's going on in pharma as well as others but there's great people you could bring it. I do believe that integrating pharmaceutical regimens is a big opportunity within informatics and the genetic profile how you can make certain therapeutics work for certain class of patients and know they won't work for others because a lot of the therapeutics don't have the effect we want but you can probably get somebody better to answer on the pharma question. Wait in the back yes. Our FDA type regulations different international markets five years ago the FDA had the most organized process with the most straightforward milestones and I'll call it stability and understanding and some of the more difficult and the reason why more clinical trials innovation and that was really the case for about 15 years. And that's why most of the clinical trials and invention was going on here and about five years ago that started to change and now most people go do clinical studies first in man trials first in woman trials sorry first in human trials and and work like that that's moving out to the European countries Latin American others not because they're lower cost necessarily but because there's a more straightforward process to move through to get the clinical understanding. That informs how you come back to the FDA then with with a pivotal trial design or something else although they won't accept typically the FDA won't accept those they need to be needs to be in the United States. So it's just flipped the reverse that the USA used to be the gold standard and the place you'd start and then with that in hand you could go out to the rest of the world now it's just the reverse my fear is our regulators are trying to say to others slow down you're making us look bad and it really can crush innovation safety is critical and important that's up you can't do without that and if you're not doing it right there need to be repercussions but the innovators I know are passionate about. Curing disease and improving patient life and and it's it's getting slower and tougher but it's right now easier outside the US than in. Shall I move on keep in track of time here I'm going to so we've got a great market in here I can give you all referrals for great orthodontist in the area if you're interested interested but but I you know it's fun for me to talk about this business we could do this for three or four more hours you have a lot more to do. So what I like to do is shift to this idea and then go into management leadership ideas we've been working very hard on evolving and scaling this business but but we wouldn't have had the opportunity to do that if it wasn't for that crazy idea that most every venture capital type up and down San Hill road said no to. Client or Perkins want up funding it but but if they hadn't said yes we're willing to bet on this crazy idea we wouldn't we never would have had the opportunity to to evolve and create this great story and it would have been one more idea never acted on so you're sitting here in the absolute cradle of entrepreneurship and innovation I'd say go do something go create that revolution your own minds before you do that though. Think about how even as you start you can plan ahead to make sure that when you pioneer that space when you create that opportunity how are you going to figure out with your friends your partners your employees to be able to capture the opportunity that means or you're going to be the first blip that somebody else owns the space on so think not just about how you're going to create the revolution but how you're going to build a real business and capture that profit and one organizing principle today and I'm a fan of Clayton Christianson I you know you see it in reality today he says be patient for growth don't be patient for profitability that's a really interesting idea and that's flipped on its head from what we talked about in 1997 98 when funding was available back then it was go for eyeballs poor money on it and run hard and get your get your turf like the great land rush back in the 1800s today I think you have the opportunity to say how do I create a real business is there a real business model here or is this just an idea that I have to pour cash into so be have the end in mind think about how you would scale this business and turn into a real company and sometimes it wouldn't be a real company maybe it's just an interesting product all right shift gears and I'm just going to put all these up here and talk through them and we can you can ask a few questions about it and I'll just call these you know hard one experience every one of these that I speak that I speak about I've usually violated so if I just start with what I used to think about for strategic planning and the ideas I used to think I'll come up with the brilliant idea or the strategy and then I'll hire the right people to help me execute it the answer is it's just the opposite everything starts with having the right people around the table having the right team and along the way that team has to evolve the people you started with may not be the people you can go through the middle with the main happy the people you can scale with because they have different skills and temperament they may have different things in mind but at any point ask yourself are these the right people with me am I and by the way have I changed am I working at the right place if you're at somebody else's company but everything starts with the right team whether it's a startup whether it's an operating business or anything else you can tell I don't like this stuff at all right but but I don't you know I don't know how you go through life without being alive and feeling passion and having a purpose and so part of this great thing about having a startup is it kind of weens itself out it's got to fit itself into your life it might disrupt your your degree across your parents or whatever is paying for your college or really have some ideas about that you're doing what but the idea is if you're passionate about it and you can't sleep because you have to do it and it's completely unreasonable that it's going to sort itself out pretty quickly whether you're really serious about it or not that's how you how you you bring your passion to bear or something else I'm just telling you life is short if you're sleep walkins fix it change it if you're in a company you're not passionate about get out of there find another job find a place you can make a difference have some fun work with people you believe in and it's look it's not perfect you're always going to have bosses or people to work for your co-workers that are jerks and you can always find reasons to you know you're going to feel like a victim but I'm telling you right now if if you're not feeling alive even when you got a lot of work to do with Stanford in a great engineering school and you got homework to do tonight in labs just telling you change it and it life is all about passion when it comes to turning that personal passion into a company you have to have a vision and you have to have this compelling idea about what you're going to accomplish and how are you going to go about it so you can get people to opt in or to opt out and they can say that isn't for me they can't read your mind as a manager as a founder and they're not going to figure out do that so hard to mobilize an entire organization whether it's three people or three thousand without compelling vision mission and passion and it better be genuine you know the thing on the card what are you really about as a company what matters to the people there how many of you find yourself in life focusing on the journey how many of us do that boy it's really hard right now I love this slog right that's just you know it's really tired your your dragon you fight Nicole you got a lot of work to do you know have a got much money you're going I'm not feeling the love right now for the journey the point is though you're always looking ahead if you can't find some energy out of the journey no matter where you are in your life situation whether in school or you're working and if the journey doesn't especially when you're if you get a group of people around you that you love to be on the journey with if that journey becomes as important the good days in the bad is as the destination you're going to be successful if you find that you're only thinking you in there is focusing in the future whether it's my stock options someday might be worth money whether it's if I just do this for a couple years I'll get a better job if that's then it's just the means and so the point is find a way even in the hard times this is not just work but it's life to say you know am I doing what I want to be doing how can I extract a little bit of joy the journey even at the hardest times and I and that's a challenge and we all go through that but that's the thing that renews you in spirit and it's the thing that you're going to do is a lot of work that's going to be doing it. So that's the thing that renews you in spirit. Now we get down to the real stuff this question earlier about financing if you don't make money over some period of time it seems to exist there are amazingly great companies here in the valley that that three or four years ago had great futures and they're getting crushed in financing those are the ones that are getting financed or they're going away. So this kind of Darwinian they're the companies that are getting financed are the best in class companies and but but it's a hard thing so the point is at some point with any company you have to not be a nonprofit anymore so you have to figure out a way to make money or you're going to cease to exist and even if you're a wealthy operating company it's make a lot of money you're only a few turns around the corner from disaster a disruptive new entrant a problem so you always have to be thinking about what happens if this happens if growth slaps you're going to be a lot of money. So if you're not going to lose how will we adjust do we have plan a bc so it goes back to if you're not making money you're not in control your own life with a company whether you're an entrepreneur and if you can't see how you'll finance it then you got to figure out how to bootstrap it yourself and make enough to at least cover your costs. So I have friends at McKinsey and other great consulting firms and they're great strategy presentations at the end of the day that strategy relies on execution and execution relies on whether it's three of you in a room and you've got a little company or whether it's 3000 people everybody understanding what the play is knowing what they're supposed to do and then making that happen again and again and again and so things and you're doing it in concert and so you're going to get rewarded for finishing it. So you're doing that by searching stuff in life, whether it's school, whether it's your business building something and so the strategy is really about the beginning often the execution is about ensuring you can finish that. Make sense? I know it sounds boring. I'm just an operating guy. What do I know? All right. I'm not so boring as you think. Going too fast is far better than going too slow. And so most of the mistakes when you don't make a decision, guess what, what is that? That's making a decision, right? Especially if it's hard or it's going to upset somebody or whatever, how many times have you done something you find said, boy, I should have done that a long time ago? Is that any of you have that experience? You know it and just takes time. So in an organization, imagine that kind of magnified by the number of employees you've got. And if you drop in that reflex delay for what everybody knows is the right thing to do, even if it's hard, you just burn time and that's the thing you can't get back. So going to fast creates problems. But if you're good about it, you can undo those and adjust. But if you're at least if you're ahead in the right direction, going fast, making decisions quickly and then adjusting is usually a far better problem than going too slow and considering it forever. And that leads to the next one, which is procrastination is the mother of all ineptitude. You can always find a reason not to do it now and a boss of mine a long time ago who was really hard on me. You can tell I'm now I admire him. He used to make me do the thing I hated the most on my list of to-dos. I'd have a whole list of stuff I had to get done. And he'd say, I got to see that by noon. I'd go, oh, I thought I could put that off till next week. And the point was get after the hardest thing. And you guys have learned this. You're all smart. You're in great school. When you're fresh, you go after your hardest subject, your toughest lab, and you get at it when you're fresh. And even if it's not what you want to do, something you have greater interest in, but you know you got to do that. You've learned by experience. So the point is, if you put off this thing that's hard, or it's ugly, or it isn't defined, it's just going to get worse. And it goes back to the point above that, right? Now you're going slow. This idea about winning and momentum and confidence, it just when, especially, it's you. When you start getting successful, something you're going, wow, that went pretty well. You feel like you can take more risk. You feel like you can move faster. You trust your instincts better. It's like that magnified in a company. Once a team starts to have success, it just further primes the pump. And this idea of momentum and confidence, and ability to take risk just gets magnified. And by the way, you can lose that. And then it's a great question. Do we go back to being risk averse? Or do we continue to press advantage? And the answer is, all right, what do we learn from that? How do you fix that? What went wrong? What would we have done better? Have an after-action review and say, boy, that may have screwed up, and it may be painful. But what do we take on that? How do we reapply that quickly? Doesn't mean everything else we did wasn't right. Just means we stubbed our toe on this one. Now go back and reapply that. So this idea of, and then gaining confidence in yourself and your team to go along. That's a really big deal. When you haven't had that win, now you got to get a few wins under your belt, and the organization takes off from there. So here we are. Most of our competitors out there are huge companies, and we're competing with divisions of theirs. They have vastly greater resources, huge organizations. They can put almost unlimited capabilities to work against us. So guess what? You saw the slide. We have enormous intellectual property in this area, and we keep inventing new things and extending our intellectual property and imagining how one of you brilliant people would come up with an idea now after I've given you this lousy little speech, how you could get at a line technology as a competitor. So what I'll call is healthy. If you're paranoid, something's behind you, right? You're only paranoid if there really is somebody behind you. I guess it's the definition from a psychologist friend of mine. The point is, you always stay humble and hungry, and be paranoid that somebody could get at your business. And if you do that, and you always imagine whether it was a big company or a startup, what would they have to invent to turn us upside down? What would a big company have to do to upset our business model and do better than we can? What if somebody could satisfy the customer dramatically better at a better value proposition than we could? And so you maintain that healthy paranoia, and that helps keep you humble and hungry. And again, if your goal is not only to innovate, but to capture a lot of the advantage in the space, then it kind of takes naturally. And then this last question about culture when we were talking over here, any leader, whether you're the manager of a small department or a group of three and you're the CEO, you cast a shadow, and those are good habits and personal styles as well as bad. And you usually have blind spots. So have the presence of mind to understand that how you're being perceived isn't necessarily how you believe you're being perceived, and to recognize that the great things about you are also there are things that aren't great about you that either rub other people or create challenges or some people don't understand you. So I'd say be open to 360, accept that's party or opportunity for growth, and recognize that any leader cast a shadow, good and bad, and we're all humans, and none of us are perfect. Any thoughts, questions about this? Yes? Is your IP council in house or outsourced in line? The question is, is our IP council in house or outsourced? And one of the things that the answer is in, we have a pretty significant IP staff for a company of our side, and we use a lot of external litigators. We've been in lots of IP tussles, we've never lost an IP battle about our IP. And we've protected it and defended it and extended it very well. But one of the things the company did very, very well, I give them enormous credit, they recognized how novel this was, and along with the financing sources, the VC said, let's invest real resources into writing quality disclosures and thinking how we'd practice this art, and creating a very good patent estate. We have an amazing patent estate. So that's important to us, we spend real resources on it. It's most of its insight. Other questions? Almost ready to the end of your attention span. And we talked about this, that there is a sea change going on from a policy perspective as we're trying to figure out the new healthcare system, if it is yet a system indeed. And that means regulators and policy makers and others are all in motion for a young company trying to get funding and for existing companies trying to bring new products and innovation, that's paralyzing. The problem is on the bottom, everybody's becoming more risk averse. And I was railing against a friend of mine who runs a lot of life science venture deals. And they said, we believe in some of these young companies. If we fund a big A round right now about something we really believe in, when it comes to the B round, we're gonna get crushed anyways. And our whole investment way up top. So we're just waiting for somebody else to do that and then we'll do the B round in crushem. Now you know what, that means the company never gets off the ground because everybody's waiting for that. The second thing is nobody wants to take any risk. And so everybody's pulling back, that's everybody in the system. At the end of the day, what this means is, I think we're gonna have a very big problem. The next five to seven years, we're gonna have a bit of a gap in technology and innovation flow that's gonna propagate through the system. My hope is this all settles down. The rules kinda get established and propagated. And we all adjust and we continue to move biotech and medtech forward. With that, I'll just basically say to the question up here by the young lady, there are still incredible opportunities in life sciences, in medtech and biotech. And there is so much need, so statistic that only 8% of the world's population even has basic access to a doctor, only 8%. So imagine what's possible for us to think about helping the rest of the population. You got some big trends, urbanization, affluence increasing, and disease states going from acute to chronic. Imagine the scale for the world over the next 50 years of what that translates to. So there will be, these are enormous societal problems. There will be opportunities to make huge impact in people's lives and to build great companies. And so with that, I'll stop, I think I'm out of time. And I thank you for your attention.
