 You are listening to the Draper Fisher-Jurvinson entrepreneurial thought-leader seminar, brought to you weekly by Stanford Technology Ventures program at Stanford University School of Engineering. I'd like to cut to the chase and introduce our guest for today, Nick Earl, who's a vice president and general manager at Electronic Arts. Prior to taking on this role, Nick was actually in charge of the Electronic Arts Redwood Chores Studio as the Chief Operating Officer and had very, very interesting games under his responsibility and he's got a great lineup for us today. So Nick, we're really looking forward to having you back at Stanford and look forward to sharing your insights with us. Let's welcome Nick Earl. Thanks for having me. I know I'm competing with the Hoot tonight, so hopefully this will be as interesting for you guys. I think the first thing I'm going to do is just start with a little video of some next-gen software and then we'll kind of jump into the content of the presentation. So that's just a little taste of some of the products that we're working on and the process of shipping. We're the dawn of yet another generation of hardware systems out there and it's very time we're having this discussion today because so much is going on in our industry and that's really what I'm going to focus on today. What is happening in the video game business? Talking and then talking a lot about the strategy that EA is bringing in order to deal with that because it's just so much going on. So 1982 is when Electronic Arts was founded. It was founded on the notion of celebrating Game Makers as artists. It was really sort of a united artist approach where Electronic Arts was essentially going to publish and distribute the creation from Game Makers. The realities have sort of changed these days where it's really harder to do that. Instead I'd say we celebrate Teams of Game Makers. In 1982 one or two people could create a product. Today it takes 100, sometimes 200 people to do it. But we still believe that we are here to kind of change the landscape of entertainment. And as a result we're the leading publisher of video games and computer games in the world. We have 7,000 people in the company. 5,000 are on the development side actually responsible for making games right from the original idea through to the final to the final disk. And 2,000 are approximately on the sales and marketing side. We live in an age where gaming has really become pop culture. It is ubiquitous. It is out of the closet. It is really a new age that we live in in terms of how important gaming is. Certainly compared to where we were in 1982. The technology that we have available for gaming today has really changed what we can deliver. Lots of debate about whether games were better back in the day compared to today. Just based on the technology. Based on the number of people who play video games. It is pretty certain the technology has had a very positive change. So what does electronic arts do? We do a lot of things. One of the things we like to say probably more than anything else is really create properties, create franchises. From really from features or collection of features right through to the notion of a franchise. It is very important for us. We do both license games, whether it is a sports license or a movie license. For example, the Lord of the Rings and Superman. We try to create a lot of original IP which is very tough but rewarding. As I mentioned, we are big. We are very big inside the industry. We are the leaders by far. We use that to our advantage in terms of what we have to offer. We like to think we have a very broad portfolio in terms of the type of games that we release. Sports products, owned IP licenses. And then in terms of an environment for people to come work. It is very stable. A lot of innovation going on. And we sort of cover everything that happens in the industry. We are spending a lot of time and energy and money and investment on the next generation. And it is interesting we are having to talk tonight because next week, PlayStation 3 and Nintendo we launch. The Microsoft X360 system is out. It has been out for almost a year. And it has been very successful. I would say next week really officially kicks off this next generation. One of the very important initiatives inside of Electronic Arts despite the fact that we have so many studios around the world. This 13 of them at this moment is that we really act as one studio. So there is a tremendous amount of sharing of technology, of people, of resources, features, anything that we create that we can share across the studios. I think that is one of the greatest things about EA. And something that I found surprising when I started there that is such a big kind of disparate group of studios could actually work together in concert the way we do. Something that is relevant to this group. Just some of the things we are working on from an engineering standpoint. Engineering games is incredibly challenging because you work in a very constrained environment in terms of memory and throughput. So you are trying to compete with other media, you are trying to compete with other publishers and developers all of whom are trying everything they can to get more out of the hardware. So these are just some of the things we are working on. And one of them here at UCAP is I want to show you a video of this is a new capture, motion capture technique that we used on two games last year. That we launched this year, one is Tiger Woods. And we feel it has really taken the motion capture, especially facial animation to the next level. So let's run this movie here. It is fair to say we actually captured his smile. And that is probably a good thing. So talk a little bit about the industry. It is about a $25 billion at retail market. It was in 2005 and that is the software side only. It is currently the North American business is bigger than Hollywood box office. That is theatrical release. That is not included DVD. It gives a sense of just how big the business has become. In terms of the demographics, I think a lot of people are surprised to know that the average age of a gamer in North America is 29. I think most people think it is 9 or maybe 19 but not 29. And interestingly, there has been a huge increase in the number of women gamers lately. Close to 40% of gamers are now women which is great. It is really broadening the market. Again, just to play into that a little bit, it is just a graphic that shows how many people are gaming every single week. And you watch 4% are going to see a movie in the theater and close to 60% are playing some kind of video game every week. So there is our rank. Obviously we have got a commanding lead on the second place publisher Activision based down on Los Angeles. This is both good and bad. It is a growth company. It is hard to continue to grow the way that Wall Street wants us to. And it is hard to maneuver the carrier when you need to change strategies which we are doing right now. So again, being big and being successful is sort of a double-edged sword. And right now I think one of the great challenges at EA is how do you move this $3 billion business along to really, I guess, the next hill. We are going to talk a lot about that today. So where is the industry going? There is a lot of things happening in the industry that we will talk about. I just think it is important to kind of start off with the reminder that the bulk of the business by far and away is still packaged goods. So when you think about going into electronics boutique or game stop as it now is or best by Walmart. That is by far and away where the business is today and will be certainly for years to come. So that said it is not growing at a very fast pace, certainly not what we are used to. And we are also learning that it is just getting incredibly expensive to launch games. So making games we have known for a long time is very expensive. You could spend $15, $20 million making game these days. To launch a game has become more expensive. What you need to spend at retail. You are really looking for events that allow you to kind of rise above the noise and there is a lot of noise out there. It really requires looking beyond. And that beyond includes things like mobile. So mobile is kind of the new hot thing I say along with online in terms of an opportunity to create games and market them. Growing at a very fast growth rate. If you think about mobile phones as a device to play video games it really is by far and away the largest install base. Install base means a number of hardware units out there. With that said it is completely fragmented. So there are all different types of devices with different user interfaces, different size screens, different technologies, which makes it very challenging. But it can't be ignored. We have about a third of people in America playing games in a mobile device. One of the other things that is really moving rapidly right now is Asia. It is really coming alive as a market for gaming. Japan has always or has been a market or has been a powerhouse market. But we are not entirely positive there is going to stay that way. There is sort of changing demographics there with birth rates. And it just feels like it is not the kind of growth market that you look around the rest you see in the rest of Asia. China, clearly the new frontier. A lot of people over there and certainly a big market. But again you have challenges in terms of how you joint venture. It is really hard to set up companies. It is hard to bring your profits out. And IP protection is a perennial issue. So the mitigation there is really to go online. And that is sort of a whole new suite of technologies. And the South Korea is an interesting market. It is so ingrained in the culture there that the best gamers are really celebrated as celebrities. And revered cyber cafes are really big. It is a way that they socialize. And there is tremendous government support going into gaming in South Korea. Another recent phenomenon that is really gaining steam right now and getting a lot of presses in game advertising or dynamic advertising. Very controversial in terms of the way it is being received in the marketplace. Publishers love it because it is a great revenue source. Or certainly has the great potential to be. And you can see that staff there that analysts see this going to a billion dollars a year by 2009. So the eyeballs are there and gaming and advertise one access. I think one of the interesting questions is to wonder whether gaming evolved to kind of free and pay the way that television has. So what we will see how that happens and it is certainly a possibility that there could be free games in the future that are advertising based. And paid ones that are non advertising. We have a couple of slides that are talking about Hollywood and gaming. As you can see it is sort of the CG that is used in feature films, feature animation, visual effects. And that is using gaming is now very similar. It is very close. Meaning that we compete for scarce resources as developers and employers of developers with Hollywood. And you get a sense of the type of characters that we are creating our world from a technical standpoint or approaching. Certainly the trajectory is to be there at pre-rendered film at some point in the near future. So we call it kind of getting Pixar in that respect. As I mentioned earlier it is becoming incredibly expensive to develop games. It already was expensive to develop movies. It is sort of interesting that you can make a movie much cheaper than you can make a game these days. And that used to sort of really used to be the opposite. But with the invention of the digital video camera and editing offline editing tools it can be done fairly inexpensively. It is very hard to make competitive games these days for less than multiple millions of dollars. And you know when you put the resources that EA does into games you are talking you are well into the tens of millions. And this is really just to point out that clearly there is going to be and starting to be partnerships with Hollywood and gaming. And there has been a lot of talk about this for the last sort of ten years. But it feels like it is really happening now. So continuing on with what is happening in the industry. There are learning and family games that are really taking hold now. I am sure many of you have played Brain Age which is an NDS game. And this is just incredibly popular. It has just taken off in Japan and really starting to take off here as well. And that is really broadening the market which is a very positive thing. I mentioned a minute ago about the Nintendo Wii launching next week. The Nintendo Wii is I think probably the best example of a really and truly immersive controller. This device for those who don't know about it, it is called a nunchuck. And essentially it really does look like one. It is two things you hold in your hand. We are going to see a video up in a minute. And you really and truly interact with the software. So swinging a tennis racket in a tennis game is like this. And swinging a golf is really like this. And it really takes things to the next level. So let's have a look at a little video and give you a sense of where controllers are going. And I think this is going to be consistent for other systems. So let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. And let's have a look at the video. So this is really going to usher in a whole new age of in terms of the controller devices. And you can just see how much more interactive it is the way you you can really use your whole body. Another concept that is really taking hold is user-generated content. I think we all know this. This is really happening in many media, including TV. media, including TV. It is really what we think it really defines this kind of next big generation. We call millennials, they're 12 to 28. And they're very big in number and very into creating their own media and creating their own entertainment. Machinima is a really good example for those who don't know Machinima. You can take a game and essentially create a movie and then post that on places like YouTube. And there's a lot of that going on. So one of the things we're thinking about is how do you create a game that's all about customized content? And we think we got something in motion, but I'll get to that in a second. And then along with mobility, mobile phones, I think the other kind of major area of growth that has really changed in the business is online. And this is a profound change in what's happening. I think this is represented a significant challenge for EA, which has been kind of king of the package good hit products and really king of that particular hill, which has been all offline. And now the world is going online and we're having to react pretty quickly. Growing at a very high rate, it allows you to distribute more content. There's obviously a great economic bonus for that, but obviously a great challenge is communities are sprouting up everywhere. We really see two court segments in the online world, the casual and the hardcore. The casual we think is more like sort of checkers and chasts and those sorts of games. MMOs we think really defines the core gaming segment, but there's a good chance that we'll see some casual massively multiplayer online games, which is what MMO stands for. Just a graph showing the active subscriptions for MMO in North America, starting in January of 97, virtually nothing going up to where it is today in the 3 million range. This is actually just a few franchises, but you just get a sense of that growth rate. And it's really showing no signs of slowing down. Virtual worlding we just think again has become so popular and accepted. Years ago it was sort of thinking about in the closet and now it's completely out and everyone's doing it. So much so the world of Warcraft, which is by far and away the most successful massively multiplayer game right now has 6 million subscribers all paying a monthly fee for that game. Community is huge. There's a lot of examples of this going on. I think the best example in our businesses, what's happening with Xbox Marketplace or Xbox Live. And for those who have an Xbox 360, you really have a sneak peek into where the future is, with regards to creating communities online in the video game world. So lots of content that's being downloaded, a lot of people getting together and playing games. Two billion Microsoft points have been spent today. It's just a staggering number considering that that has only been around for a short while. Digital distribution talked a little bit about this before. This is truly happening. It feels like the last generation of PlayStation 2 and Xbox was really a dress rehearsal for this and now it's really here. So we and all publishers have taken this very seriously. There's lots of different models here, whether it's a subscription model or a paper play. But at the end of the day, this is just a huge margin improvement from packaged goods for obvious reasons, no costs of goods, no return or fewer returns. And this is definitely happening. Microtransactions. Last example of this in our world, I'm sure most of us have downloaded something from iTunes. Ringtones are happening. Ebay is a great example. In our world, we're seeing lots of expansion packs and buying of swords or new sorts of gloves and tiger woods. And there's just lots of things that are happening in the microtransaction. People are buying gold for real money so they have gold inside of massively multiplayer and role-playing games. So I think a big question for us is, can we organize a game or create a game to be an entertainment hub the way that my space is? I think MMOs certainly have the potential for that. Marka place we talked about, can EA sports be the new ESPN despite the fact that we're close partners? It's something that's great interest to us to figure out how to create a community around that. So I think we're going to see a lot of innovations there and we're thinking long and hard about how we do it. So on that note, what are the things we're doing? On the package good sides, we're in great shape because we're continuing all of our franchises and creating new ones. We're the number one publisher on X360 and we should be that way on PS3. I think Nintendo will be harder for us because Nintendo is such a powerful and strong creator of software. It's going to really hard to compete with them ahead on but I could see us being number two there. Same for handhelds, the PSP, the NDS. NDS is a fairly non-market commodity for us so I think we'll be strong in that respect and certainly our core demographic. On the mobile phone front, we acquired a company called Jamdat. Jamdat was the leading publisher of cell phone games in North America and a leading one in Europe. So it was just a good combination of our distribution power, our marketing muscle and our IPs with the company that's really figured out how to grow and be successful in the mobile phone space and there are a lot of publishers so that was a great purchase for us. We talked about creating IP, intellectual property. This has been a huge initiative inside of electronic cards. EA is probably better known for licenses or for buying properties. We're not really known for creating it from scratch so there's a lot of that that's happening and great effort going into it. We did about 40% of our revenue last year came from IP that we owned and we are, we think we're going to be able to get to 50% next year and continue to grow. So higher margin but I think probably more important for us is that it is very engaging for developers to create software and games that we own as opposed to having to stick to a licensed or an established set of rules. We talked about how Hollywood and games are really starting to partner. We've got a partnership with Spielberg on doing three properties that we will own and he may make movies out of that. That'll be sort of an ancillary business but he is very engaged in this. He sits at our LA office, a studio once a week. His son actually works there and so it's just something very close to him personally but it's just one example of how the movie business and the games business is really starting to merge. With regards to music, we are looking at a situation where songs are being broken by video games and this is sort of a recent phenomenon but in Madden, in Bay, live and Sims we've seen pretty successful examples of rock stars and pop artists actually launching games so much so that's you know it's almost more important for them to do that with a game that there is on a movie soundtrack. So this is something we are very focused on and we've had great success. We talked about user generated content and machine them. I just want to show you one that was created by someone using Sims. I think this was a... He's the roughest person to check your player there ever was but he's no match for this tough bird. Even he and he tries to beat this foul but this is one tough crater. Which leads us to the moral of our story. If you can't beat him, he'll... Ready to team for team. So that was created. That was off of PC Expansion Pack and there's a lot of that going on. There's literally thousands of those out. Just talking a little bit more about user generated content. I think the Sims is probably our best example of a franchise that is we're able to do this in terms of the number of websites and the number of that are full with content from based on Sims products. This has been a great success for us and hopefully more to come. So it's sort of jumping back to online. What are we doing there? This has been the main focus for us as a company in terms of trying to implement a new strategy. So on the casual side we've got a division called POGO which is all about casual games. We've got a little over a million subscribers there that are monthly subscribers. On the hardcore side we purchased a group called Mythic out in Washington. They did a game called Dark Age of Camelot and they're doing a game now Warhammer which is a great license and we hope to compete with World of Warcraft as hard as that is to do. That's certainly the intention. A lot of downloads that is going over Xbox Marketplace, Xbox Live. We're trying to figure out how we can take EA Spore. It's an creative community and a business around that online. We've signed deals with massive and IGA on the advertising side so a lot of work is going into dynamic advertising. Again, I'm sure exactly where this is going but it's certainly something that cannot be ignored at this moment. And the user generated content, a lot of happening, stuff happening in the Sims, a lot of success. The next one for us is Spore. Spore is a product that we're doing in my studio that Will Wright has created. Will Wright for those who don't know created the Sims and Sims City and this is his next big thing. I think the great opportunity in online that no one owns at this point is the console massively multiplayer online game. Consoles have not had the ability to hook up to each other until now and I think it will be interesting to see if we can create a persistent world in the console business. I'm sure it's going to happen. I think that's kind of the next big hill because the video game business is much bigger than the PC business so it's sensitive to the reason that this is even higher potential than something like World of Warcraft. Warhammer I just mentioned this is the game that Mythic's working on and I'm just going to show you a little movie here. There's some fun for the whole family there. All right, so this is just kind of a fusion of online and Asia. One of the things we're doing right now is taking some of our package goods product like FIFA which is our big soccer game and creating an online and online experience has been a big success still early but certainly a good start for us in terms of the number of unique users and the peak concurrent users. Paul, I mentioned earlier, we think of this as kind of a my space for 35-year-old women. It's interesting for us for a company that's really pale to kind of testosterone driven young men to be able to have a community for 30-year-old women as sort of an example of how the market is broadening. And then finally, I'm spore. This is I think holds a great promise for us. It's something that I'm personally very involved in. It's one of the franchises in my studio and it is promises to be kind of our next opportunity to create user-generated content. It really is what the game is all about. The concept is you start as a cellular creature and we'll call it a way up to dominating the universe and sort of everything in between. It's epic in scale and scope. It's only something that will be able to do and I think it's going to be a great example of a game that allows you to customize your experience. So kind of in summary, like I said earlier, this is very timely to be able to have this session here tonight because we are just sort of in the dawn of this new age and it is something that is really kind of dominating every thought and every ounce of energy in the company right now. We're in a position of strength but there's a lot we need to do to be able to kind of maintain our lead and grow our lead. So on that note, we're really focused on the next-gen consoles because that's the core business but mobility and online are really the sort of the future. So that's it for the presentation. I guess we'll go to Q&A. Or not. Yeah. So you mentioned branch as an example of what I call that series game. I would say that is part of the idea to strategy or to think about all of getting into the game. Yeah, we are. I think it's a kind of a cross between a learning and a serious game. That is, you know, that's not a core business for us obviously. We've dabbled around in educational or agitamid space and never been successful but the success of that game makes us think the market is changing. So we are looking at it. I didn't really have any good content to kind of bring up here. We have some stuff that's just too early but yes, we are looking at it. And with that said, it feels almost sort of a rounding error compared to what we are doing for online and mobility. Yeah. You mentioned that getting business, $1.00 a proposition a lot of years. So what do you think of startups? I think it's a very difficult, very hard for startups to start doing games. You know, it's interesting. If you would ask me that. Yes, sorry. The question was, it is an expensive proposition to start developing a game. So what about the idea of starting a developer company to build games right now? Is that hard? My answer is a year ago I would have said it's really hard. It's don't do it. Run screaming for the hills. Don't even think about it. I think what's happened in this last year is that with Xbox Live and Xbox Marketplace, we've seen examples of games that could be by credit by a small group that are sort of funding off a credit card, the way that you see these small independent movies being funded, and they could find success selling directly to an audience, kind of a captive audience through that mean. So I think the world is changing a little bit in that respect. And it's interesting because a year ago I would have said it's just impossible for a small developer to really get up and running unless it's an experienced splinter group of a larger developer that's capitalized in some way. Maybe they've got a shot, although it's highly risky. So I guess in summation, I think it's possible. You need to think about what your audience is. You need to think about what kind of game you're building. To go and try to compete against Madden or to compete against one of these big movie licenses, that is impossible. To create a smaller footprint game, an arcade game that's for the cell phone, that's actually doable. Yeah. So the question is, are we making games specifically for China and how do we protect our property? The answer to the first question is, yes, we are. We have a studio that we just created in Shanghai. We have a publishing division that's already out there. We have some joint ventures that are in motion. And we are creating games that are specifically for that marketplace. For us, it's a real learning experience because we're very understanding of what the interests are in the Western societies in North America and Europe. We don't know a lot about what's really in demand in Asia and we're still learning. But yes, we're creating some games over there. We're kind of reformating some of our existing products. Like I showed you, FIFA Online, that could be a product that we could take into China. The second part of the question is, how do you protect your IP? Really the best way and really the only way that we know of right now to protect your IP is to make it a purely online experience. To put a package good product out there means that you'll basically sell one copy and hundreds of thousands of millions of people will be playing it. That's not interesting. To do it online where you can sort of check the heartbeat of the machine and make sure that they are paying customer is feasible and that's really the way around protecting your IP. It's a real challenge. Yeah. Yeah. You know what we know about it. You said you see advances in graphics, game driven by the games in Australia and the industry in general and what it's going to buy after the end of the research. And also, looking at the future as games and complex art and you're able to make a new experience. So, let's say the first question is thinking about what's really driving, what's really driving CG advances. It's a good question. I'm really thought a lot about where it's coming from. My hunch is that it is coming more from feature animation and games than probably anywhere else. I haven't seen a lot of examples coming out of academia that are kind of driving it. With that said, there are some great programs in schools these days here and I think CMU, USC or some schools that kind of pop to mind that are really focusing on computer graphics as a discipline and video games as a discipline. So we're seeing a lot of really bright young people who are coming into electronic arts with kind of new thinking and new ideas and are helping us kind of get to that next level. Let's start with what was the second question? The second question. Do you see EA ever taking your expertise into the website? So will EA ever branch out into other things, you know, serious things beyond games? I hope not. Actually, I'm kidding when I say that because obviously it would be potentially good and good for society, good for humanity possibly. I think the truth is there's so much to do in entertainment right now and there's so much there's so much change is going on and so many sort of interesting new areas to be in. I can't see that happening in the foreseeable future but you know, it's always a possibility and you know, sort of five to ten years but not in the media future. Yeah. So the question is what is what is it like to program for these next generation machines, PS3, X360 in particular? It is every generation presents a whole new set of challenges. This is by far and away the most complex generation from an engineering standpoint, you know, an order of magnitude greater. These are all sort of parallel processing machines as multi-threading going on. It is, it really takes a different architecture. It really takes architects that we don't currently have that we're having to bring into the company to understand how to kind of distribute your engineering that's going on. There's these sort of cellular chips in architecture of PlayStation 3 in particular presents sort of a whole new range of challenges. So with that said, we always figure out how to do it. It takes, you know, the engineers are very grumpy for the first year and a half of developing for these new systems and then as soon as they kind of figure it out and we launch, we launch our first suite of products, they kind of get past it and they start to get excited about what the potential is for these machines and you saw some of the stats and a couple of my slides, the possibilities are really exciting in terms of what you can do given the computing, the raw computing power of these machines. So generally speaking, very tough for the year leading up to a launch of a system and after that you get pretty comfortable and over the ensuing years, five, six, seven, eight years of a particular hardware cycle. You really start to explore what the real boundaries of that architecture are. Yeah. But what would you mean new companies, new new consoles, what would be your bet for that? For the winner? The winner? The Wii, the PlayStation 3 and the X-O. Yeah. So the question is, who's going to be the winner between Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii? It's actually interesting because PlayStation has been the clear winner in the last two generations. So, PlayStation 1 and then PlayStation 2. Now with PlayStation 3 it's going to be a lot tighter race. And so what we see is a fairly even playing field. If you kind of look globally, in Japan, Microsoft is not going to really get a foothold, so it's really going to be PlayStation, it's going to be Nintendo. In Europe, Sony's PlayStation is going to be very strong and X-V60 and Nintendo are going to be fighting for second place. Probably X-V60 will get it. In North America, pretty close to even. The way that we think that's going to net out globally is PlayStation will probably have a majority from an installed base standpoint, but very close second place is going to be Xbox and maybe right there is going to be Nintendo. We do think that Nintendo may be kind of the second machine that you get. Certainly for the serious gamers who buy a second machine, they're going to buy either PlayStation X-V60 because the games are going to be very similar. It's a very similar class of machine and then they're going to buy the Nintendo away because those games are going to be very different based on that video we saw and all of the different controls you can do in the different style of games. Yeah. So the question is what I think of the high price, relatively speaking, the high price of the machines that are launching now. It's a little troubling, I think, to look at the launch landscape of PlayStation 3 in particular could be $600, $700 by the time you get a couple games and $800, $900 if you get a few peripherals with it. With that said, they're going to sell every single unit that they ship certainly for the first six months. The demand is certainly there and there are plenty of examples of devices that have sold at that number. In order to get to the next level, for example, PlayStation 2 had sold over 100 million units at an install base of over 100 million units. To get into that level, you need to be down in the 200, maybe 150, 150 range before you really can go out and sell in those numbers. Just most products, audio, video products, the price comes down and the market expands. We just don't think this is going to be something that's going to hold the business back in any way. The demand is there at that price. I know it sounds surprising, but it is. Yeah. In fact, about how EA started out as a publisher for games made by smaller groups, like programs, maybe even single people, and how it's involved into a company that builds franchise basically, which is a lot has become a household name, at least, you know, lots of people I know. And so with the emergence of user-generated content, how do you see EA sort of, like, what do you see their role as in terms of continuing creating franchise? Because it's almost like EA might not be needed if you've got an Xbox Live online community and then people creating their own content. So where do you see it? It's really depressing that you just said that about it. Nothing to do. That's all I know how to do is make games. So the question is, with user-generated content, is that going to change the nature of a company like Electronic Arts to compete and do what it does? I don't think so. User-generated content to me is something that complements the games and the franchises that we create. I don't think it's going to supplement the games that we create. I think that the game is really looking for a sort of a large experience when they purchase a game of $50, $60. And they're looking for experience that could be 20, 30, 40, 80 hours of polished gameplay. I think that machine-a-m-a-user-generated content is a component of that, a feature of that, but not something that would eclipse that. I think it's really interesting to look at movies because movies now can be really created by a small group of people. And there's a lot of examples. Blair Witch is probably top of the list of a movie that's created for virtually nothing. And look what, you know, how meaningful that was in terms of pop culture. I guess as a chance that games could evolve to that state where tools are available for a small group of people to create a game that really does that sort of, that has that sort of distribution and that sort of effect. But I do not see that being the norm. I see that being an exception. And I certainly feel that user-generated content is a feature set in a kind of a complement to the games that we create. Yeah. The mobile games? What's your take on on deck versus off deck distribution? What's your relationship with carriers? On deck or off deck? What's that? Going through a carrier or just going through the internet to get to self-own users. Don't really have a paint, so the question is on deck off deck. What's my take on that? You're not really having to paint. I'm really not a part of the mobile group. So I wasn't really even aware that that is an issue. I think the mobile business in general is evolving right now at a really rapid pace. And I think a lot of distribution questions are still yet to be answered. And a lot of marketing questions and demographic questions have just really not been answered. It's very early in the nason stages of mobile gaming. So I don't know if it's even established thinking on what's the way to go. Yeah. You were saying that the console and the WRPG are going to be the next way. They could think so. So how do you see that the extra price of having the like say exhaust, double-check the latch subscription. And then on the semi-annual RBG subscription. Where you offer like pretty much everyone in the internet connection. You think that's going to be a big change in how much people subscribe. So the question is console-based, massively multiplayer games. the fact that you have to pay an online or a fee to say to Xbox Marketplace and then obviously pay a subscription to whoever's publishing the massively multiplayer game. My sense is that anyone who, not anyone, I think many, many people who have a console machine are just gonna naturally pay for their subscription to live and it's just gonna treat it as those their internet connection and not really think about that, not add that to the annual subscription or the monthly subscription of an MMO game. The amount of business that we're seeing done on Marketplace right now, we think it's staggering. It's way beyond what we thought, both for us and just sort of in general. So I just, and clearly the guys who are doing and the guys and the women who are playing and downloading and doing micro transactions over live are kind of the top of the pyramid. I mean, they're sort of the early end into doing stuff like this. So we can't sort of judge the entire market based on their behavior, but it is well beyond what we thought they would be doing. So I think that just sort of translates out that it's not gonna hold that market back. And when you consider the power of 100 million dedicated gaming machines, which is what X-Fee Sixie could get to, that's what PlayStation 2 got to, last generation, that is a captive audience for a game like that. And they are there, unlike PCs, which you use for a variety of reasons, those machines are there for gaming. So you look, you got about a very captive and dedicated audience. Yeah. When we look at EA's strategy, it was sports game and all their sports franchises. Seems like it's a concerted strategy to pay a lot of money and sort of licensing, you know, and I guess several hundred million dollars in the face of ESPN and NFL. NFL, yeah. So I mean, can you talk about the strategy, you know, like these would be, it's like building their own sports games without, you know, if they're not paying five million dollars to have players named on their backs or just some type of, you know, real legitimacy with the actual players, you know, as opposed to spending on different, you know, game development or other strategies and not trade off and talk about it on the board. Yeah. So the question is, well, I would boil it down too, is it really worth spending the license fees on NFL and other sports licenses ESPN as opposed to spending that money elsewhere or maybe creating, I guess sort of generic sports or sports of generic players. I guess my answer would be the kind of the verdict has come in that the authenticity of real players of the NFL, PA, the NFL, the authenticity of having the teams of being the NFL base game, despite the fact that it's very expensive, that verdict has come in and it's a resounding, it is absolutely worth doing. It is, there's room for really only one, obviously one person do it with the NFL, but with other sports licenses and, for example, NBA, there are multiple players and it's still worth it to split up the market and go after and spend that kind of money. With that said, it's shrinking our margins and it is one of kind of the prime drivers for us to create our own IP. So, you know, I think it's a very good question because this, you know, sort of highlights one of kind of the strategic comparatives of a kind of electronic arts is, you've got this existing business that we have to service and we have to kind of continue to grow and yet, the business over here is where we need to get to and one of the components over here is creating our new IP. Not only is that a lot more engaging to people who are doing it and, you know, makes for a happier workplace, it's also much higher and margin and therefore healthier business to get to. So, I think we're, as a company, we have kind of the luxury of having a broad enough portfolio where you can do all of the above. It'll be interesting to see in five or 10 years, for example, even if we even have the NFL license because there may be enough offsetting over in original IPs and, you know, new sports legs to kind of offset the power of Madden. But when Madden launches, you know, that's a $250 or $300 million a weekend, the first day that game goes out. I mean, that rivals some of the biggest movies out there. It's really hard to kind of turn that down, that business down. Yeah. What looking at the smart and the concerns of Hollywood, you have, yeah, manufacturers very high-end and very expensive games like the Blockbuster in Hollywood. But while Hollywood and the film industry have all this, and the film is movies, as you mentioned, which is a very big book of the business. While in gaming, you don't see that. So how sustainable is that for the long? The question is, are we, so are we very different from Hollywood and that Hollywood has a kind of a complement of high budget and low budget independent games? You know, again, it's interesting, because I think the business is changing before our eyes in a way that that may be something where we move towards these sort of smaller independent games. I can tell you that in my studio here in Rewood Shores, it's very expensive to build games. And we are really thinking about how we can change the dynamic and the cost structure, are the different types of games that we can build. What can we do to kind of ameliorate the very, very expensive bills we get in building our products, some of which don't succeed. And in the future, we may see more independent games. With that said, it's really hard to kind of create the value with an independent or small budget game that you do with a big budget game. And we just haven't seen a lot of examples of it yet. Unless, of course, you just sort of go for a different market. And so Pogo, this online community site where you can do checkers and backgammon and those sorts of games, that's low fidelity, that's low cost, and that's low revenue. But that's probably an example of sort of segmenting the market. But I think if you're talking about the hardcore video gamer, the guy is going to go out and buy Gears of War, which is a big game that shipped a couple days ago. It's going to be really hard to kind of take an independent approach and low, low cost approach to building that sort of game. Very tough. Yeah. How do you test these games on the consumer before they go to market? So the question is, how do we test our games before they go to market? We do focus tests, like it was a religion, for example, on Godfather, which was done at my studio. We focus tested 1,000 different people over the course of about 30 weeks. They would come in and play the game, and we would capture their data. We would capture every keystroke or buttonstroke on the controller, and take that data and sort of try to understand what was going on, what the trends were, et cetera. There's a lot of focus group testing that goes on. They're kind of the classic professional focus groups where it's behind the one-way mirror. And then there's a lot of what we call Kleenex testing, which is more of a low fidelity, but high volume focus testing where you bring people in, you sit them down, you kind of capture the keystrokes. But what you're really doing is you're kind of looking at their face while they're playing game, and sort of understanding whether they're enjoying it, or they're getting frustrated, and that sort of thing. So there's a lot of that that happens. Yeah. You talk about MMO going into the console, and with the general trend of consoles beating the PCs, do you think there are any areas with a PC for main dominance in the future? Yes, good question. So the question is, will the PC remain dominant in any area? Yeah, I think, well, I guess I don't know if I would say dominant. I just think that the PC is just going to be in the landscape for the time being and for the foreseeable future. It's interesting. Every generation of video game machine tends to steal one genre away as we go. And we've seen first-person shooters that were traditionally only lived and only successful on the PC. That has really moved to the console. In this last generation, there's a lot of examples of first-person shooters that have moved over and been very successful on the console. One of our products, Medal of Honor, is a first-person shooter that I think was partly responsible for moving the audience. This generation, we're kind of looking closely to see what happens with high definition television. You can see a lot more detail. And for those of you who played games in high depth, 780 or 1080 or 720, you get a sense of just how much more you can see on screen. I think that's going to probably fuel one yet one more genre going from PC over into console. It could be real-time strategy, which is something we've been experimenting with. But with all of that said, it just feels like there's a lot of independent games or will generally come out on PC. PC's are all hooked up. So you get the whole online component. You can edit things. You can create things better on the PC. So I think it's always going to be there. And I don't see it going away. And I'm not a believer in the PC and the TV merging into one, certainly from a game standpoint. So I see it just, they're both being there as kind of as compliments. Yeah. I think we made a lot of cross-hot form games. How do you adapt it to your rival? Because it takes a weed controller and so on the other end of this? The question is, how do we deal with the fact that the weed controller is very different from the other input devices? The way we're dealing with that is that we are actually setting up studios that focus entirely on the weed platform. I think that's the way we're going to deal with it. Because it is. It's kind of an odd bird. It's a current generation look with what I call a next-next generation controller. And so there's really no very little synergies from a porting standpoint in terms of moving graphics over and content and code over from PlayStation 3 and XV60 onto the Wii. In fact, it's much better to go from current generation in terms of your content and your engineering, your code. But the controller is so radically different. It requires just different thinking and expertise and experience to really take advantage of what that controller can do. So I think our answer is really just create separated dedicated groups. And we're big believers in the Wii and the potential success. So we think it's worth that startup cost to have these separate groups. So all they do is build Nintendo Wii games. So playing port a lot of your major content that you speak of? I wouldn't use the word port because I think these are just, they really are different experiences. I think out of the gate, I guess you could port stuff over it. We've got Tiger Woods, for example, coming out in March. And the game kind of looks the same. But when you play it with the controller, it is just a unique experience. I don't think we're going to see much more of that. I think we're going to start creating originals. I think that's the way we're going to be successful in Nintendo is to create originals that are made specifically for the controller. It's probably nothing more important than how the controller relates with the software. Yeah. If you talk a little of your process for creating new ideas, you hire a lot of players or you can try to fix it and say that. So the question is, what's a process of creating new properties? Again, it's really hard to describe this because there's no real process that we go through. It just organically happens. At a company like Electronic Arts, you've got a lot of products that are already in motion. And we need to do those every year, every couple of years. And then we get licenses thrown away. So Superman and Batman, the Lord of the Rings. And we did Godfather and a lot of those. So that's how new IPs can start. In terms of creating new ones, the way it happens is a small team will generally come up with a concept. They will talk with an executive producer. An executive producer will go to General Manager, which is what I do and talk through an idea. And then if the General Manager feels like this is something that's worth funding and getting to a prototype level, he or she will do that. And when you get something to a level that's really worth looking at, then you kind of go brought around to the company and just sort of keep picking up steam along the way. It'll ultimately get built and shipped that way. But there's not like there's a definitive process. It's very kind of loose and organic. And actually, I think that's probably a good thing. The other thing that I would say in this topic is when I talk to people in my studio who want to pitch a game or want to create a game, what I say is think less about creating a property and think about creating a feature inside of a franchise. Because that takes incredible innovations. For example, the Tiger Swing, we've been talking about that. Creating a feature inside of a game. You can actually end up changing the whole value proposition of a franchise. In a good example is Tiger Woods. That was a $30 million annual franchise when it was the old method of watching the little air go around and you hit a couple buttons to swing. When we went to the analog swing, which just felt much more fluid and much more realistic, that was the fuel that grew that franchise to $120 million a year. So just creating one feature can have a profound effect on the success of a franchise. And I think that's where a lot of the energy is. We're trying to have a lot of our creative energy flow into. Yep. How do you think about the guitar move and how are you interested in creating a graphics zone? Sorry, the first part. How do you think about which audience are targeting? So the question is, what do we think about targeting? And what are the changing demographics? So let's see. I guess the way we look at demographics is just every year at ages a little bit. And obviously, I talked about earlier about how female gamers are really growing in number. So we think a lot about that. And we also think about how new applications, for example, Pogo is interesting to a whole demographic that we weren't ever really creating games for before. So I think we've probably changed our opinion from 10 years ago, where we're just going after the 18-year-old male. And now we really do segment the way we market, we segment the way we build games. And I can tell you, when we started gaming my studio, one of the first discussions we have is what is that target demographic? What's a secondary demographic you're going to go after? What are the ones you're just going to steer clear from? Not even bother with, because it really affects what you're going to build and how you're going to market your product. And we're in an age right now where demographics are just changing radically. And that's because more and more people are getting into gaming. Yeah. Thanks, Eric. Sorry. You mentioned for the sports advertising and you know, the journalism, money, do you get us five pairs of scores with the technical figures out of that? I cannot. I cannot. But suffice to say that it is something that we are incredibly excited about. And if you kind of look at the popularity and success of Sims in particular, we're thinking about it in very big ways. But it's just too, it's honestly too early. I don't even know what month it's going to launch. I'm under a lot of pressure to make sure it happens next calendar year. If you sort of forget the actual month that's going to happen, it's when you're dealing with something that is unique and inventive as that, it's just really hard to kind of give a number. Of course, we have a plan number, but we just can't discuss that. But I will say that it is we are very excited about. We think it could be an industry changing game. Any more? One more. One more? You've been in the back? How do you see the growth of your studios worldwide compared to what? Just a local versus. Right. So the question is how do we see our studio growth worldwide compared to local? Very topical issue right now because we are looking beyond the Bay Area to establish studios. The obvious kind of driver of that is cost. With that said, I think the way that we're going to grow our studios is having hubs where there's kind of core resident of expertise, design, the best engineering in the world, the greatest technical artist in the world. And then what you do is you sort of figure out a partner with kind of bulk creation that can happen in other parts of the world. That's kind of the model we're doing at my studio. There is no substitute for having the kind of engineering that exists here in the Bay Area. And we talked about just what we're up against trying to make these machines sing. And then in terms of technical art, in terms of design, in terms of production, you just can't find that talent in many places. And this is why we're just absolutely dedicated to Bay Area, dedicated to LA, dedicated to Vancouver. Those are sort of three of the center points. So the way we'll work with other studios is really partnering with them instead of figuring out what's the kind of best way to complement each other. Thank you. Thanks everyone. Thank you.
