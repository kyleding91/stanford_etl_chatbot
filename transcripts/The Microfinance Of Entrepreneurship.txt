 Let me introduce Jeff Davis, who is the president and CEO of United. And let me start out by asking you, so what is Microfinance and how does United fit into this ecosystem? Thanks, thanks again for having me here. First of all, I can ask a question of the audience quickly. Can you guys hear? It's the Microkin. Yeah. A little louder. Can get a little louder back there. Is that better? Yeah. How many of you know a bit about Microfinance? Raise your hands. How many to know nothing? How many of you are here because you want to learn more about that? How many of you are here because this is the first course of the year? You always go to everything at the beginning of the year. No one's going to be honest? There you go, thanks. Okay, so that helps. So I'll spend a little bit of time then talking about Microfinance and what it is. You saw a little bit about it there on the video. And that's from a very micro level, the idea. Around the world, most people don't have jobs. There are about three billion people in the world that live on less than $2 a day. This reference point, there are only six billion in the whole world. It's about half the world that lives on less than $2 a day. And most of them work in what's called the informal economy. They sell goat cheese in the market. Or they weave baskets and sell them in the market. Or they sell milk. Or something. They make shoes or men's shoes. Do something to get by informally. And that makes up the bulk of employment in most parts of the world in Mexico. It's 65% of the economy, for example. And so that exists. That's just reality. And most of these people who have these small businesses are incredibly cash constrained. Like this woman who needed $35 to almost double her income. $35 seems like not much to most of us here. But when she was making $2 a day coming up with $35, that was quite a lot to try to come up with. Because that entire $2 a day that she made went to feeding her family. So micro credit, I'm going to distinguish between micro credit and micro finance. Micro credit is an idea, as you heard about, that began about 30 years ago, of giving small loans to these type of people, these men and women who are working in the informal economy, to either start a business if they didn't have one, or to grow an existing business. And oftentimes it's refinancing existing credit that they might have for money lenders. And I'll just pause and give a side comment. Money lenders are alive and doing well around the world. And there's almost a cartel in money lender rates. It tends to be about 10% a day. I first started learning about this. My eyes did exactly what you just did. Wow, 10% a day. And it's usually called the 10 plus 1. So I'll ask people, or in some places, it's even worse. And in the Philippines, it's called 5.6. That means I give you 5 in the morning, whatever it is, 5 pesos, 5 fish, 5 whatever. And you give me 6 in the evening. So even more, 20% a day. But it's usually 10 plus 1. I'll give you 10 in the morning. 10% a day. 3,000% or 3,000, you know, 650% a year, which is incredible interest rate. So oftentimes microcredit loans will refinance that and allow the woman or the man who runs a small business to keep the profits from that. So around the world there are programs that have grown up to give these small loans, to give loans to poor people working in the informal economy. There are about, depending on how you count them, 3 to 5,000 of these programs worldwide that are giving small $100, $200 loans, these type of people. Which is great. It sounds like a lot. And you saw, you heard the impact on one family's life. The rub, if you will, or the opportunity since entrepreneurs, or at least wanting to be entrepreneurs, the opportunity is that less than 20% of all people who could benefit from microfinance or microcredit have access to it. So less than 20% market penetration. I'll talk a little bit more a bit later, but this is potentially a $50 billion market. And right now it's about a $1 billion market. So huge growth opportunity. I'll pause there and go on to your next question. But I'll talk a little bit more about the role that our company plays in this space and what we try to do a bit later. Okay. Well, how did you get involved with this? How did United get started? Great question. Maybe I'll answer it two ways. You asked how I got involved with this and how United got started there, separate but very related. So I, this is about my, again, dependent on how you counted. If you count the little soda pop stand that I had as a kid, I don't know how many, but at least my seventh formal startup that I've either done or been a part of. And so I've been doing that for a while. And in college as an undergraduate, I learned about microcredit and was smitten with the idea of the power of it. Use business principles to do good in the world. The, the loan that I, you saw in the video, the woman paid that loan back completely. It was done at commercial base on a commercial rate. The interest rate was about a credit card rate. So it was a, you know, commercial transaction. And I love the power and the rigor of that. And then I saw the impact that I had on people's lives. So that was one thing. And then I owned a company that I started as an undergrad as well. So the story that you heard me tell in the video was when I, after I graduated from school, I sold that company and took some money from that and some other money that I put together. And I went to Mexico to start a program to start an actual microcredit program. I had read about microcredit and done some writing, wrote a senior thesis on it and was, you know, all excited about the potential to change the world. And I went to Mexico to see what it was really like. And that was the first loan that we gave you saw in the video. So that was a bit about my background. And then I did that. Started the program, turned it over to a local nonprofit, went back and worked at a biotech startup for a number of years, and then had a chance to go to Washington, D.C. to help get something off the ground called Grimine Foundation, USA, which is an output of the Grimine Bank in Bangladesh. And while I was there, one of my jobs was starting up new microcredit programs around the world, taking the Grimine Bank methodology, which is one of the pioneers in the industry, been doing this for 30 years, very large program in Bangladesh, and replicating that in various parts of the world. And then I also ran the operations of the foundation. So I did that for a number of years, and then I did graduate work in development economics and management at, I was at the Stanford of the East. I ran a number of years. And then when I was finishing up there, I met who became, the person who became my partner in the United, Mike Murray, who's the chairman, you saw at the beginning of the video, and he was based in Seattle. He had been involved in another company, also called the United, that was doing something completely different. And they had happened upon microfinance and microcredit. Like, hey, there's something there, maybe there's something we can do with this. The other company wasn't going so well, and was winding down. They said, why don't we take the infrastructure that we built, and morph it into something different. And so Mike and I started talking and said, okay, basically, let's do that. Let's start a new microfinance accelerator, something we made up. We want to figure out what exactly that means, but let's use the existing legal infrastructure of this other company to be a microfinance accelerator. So I moved from Boston to Seattle about four years ago, and to start what is currently United, is in the United, that we'll talk about here, even though it had a previous life. Is that how? Sure, now you mentioned Grimmie and Bank, and a lot of us are familiar with Grimmie and Bank, because they go, they give these micro loans. How different are you from Grimmie and Bank? Are you doing the same thing, or you do fit a different place in this ecosystem? Yeah, great, thanks. Thanks for tossing me this off-bought question. So I can tell you what we really do. So I mentioned we're a microfinance accelerator, and if you remember the problem statement, or the opportunity, that there's less than 20% market penetration for microfinance. We found, as we've analyzed the industry, that that's fundamentally because most microfinance programs are very small, and they stay very small. So the three to five thousand in the world, most of them, about 65% of them serve less than 2,500 clients, or 2,500 families or customers. When the potential in their market area might be 250,000. So they're small, mom and pop, sometimes they say it's a 7-11, certain local geography, when it could be a Walmart or something serving a much bigger area. So we saw that, we saw the potential that was there to, at the same time, there are programs like Grimmie Bank. With millions, I think the latest numbers, 4 million clients, Grimmie Bank has in Bangladesh, and there are others who are very, very large. So we knew that scale defined by the number of clients was possible, but it wasn't happening. As we looked around the industry and looked at most of the institutions that worked 2,500, maybe 3,000 clients, we found that their growth curve started off okay, but then started to level out. And as we analyzed it further, we found that that was because they had internal operating constraints. They didn't have the infrastructure to manage large scale financial institution, and they didn't have the money they needed. So even if you're giving only $100 loans, once you give 1,000 of them, 5,000 of them, 10,000 of them, it still adds up to a lot of money. So they didn't have the financing they needed. So we created what we call the United's Acceleration Model to, it's basically using a venture approach. So if you think early stage venture, that's what we do for microfinance. We want to create the next generation of Grimmie's. We go and we scour the world looking for the programs with the highest growth potential. We find them in various countries, wherever they might be, and we invest heavily in their infrastructure, and put in place the capital structure they need to dramatically accelerate their growth to drive 10x growth. 10x growth in 5 to 7 years. So that's how we're different. We don't give $100 loans, we have even $35 loans that I described there. We give $4 million loans, or $1 million loans, to the institutions that break them up into small $100 loans to distribute. Interesting. So does that mean there has to be a micro lending organization already in place? For example, a small business or a bank that already does it? And so essentially you give them the resources to take it to the next level? That's exactly right. Why don't I give an example? It makes it concrete. So our first partner in India, we do a lot of our work in India. We're currently in Mexico, Kenya, and India, and expanding very soon to Argentina, and a number of other countries that I'm not allowed to mention yet, but they're coming. Watch our website. But anyway, in India, we have an office in India, a small office in India that's growing. We'll have about 10 people there by the end of the year, and we have five partnerships, or five portfolio companies in India. The first one that we started working with, we started two and a half years ago, and they had 10,000 clients. They had grown over five years, they had grown to 10,000 clients. They had strong management, good infrastructure, and a great market potential. 80 million people that could use microfinance in their area. And so we said, wow, let's see what we can do with them. Their long-term growth goal was 100,000 clients. They hoped to get to 100,000 clients. And we put together a plan to help them reach 350,000 clients within five years. And we put together a plan to transform them from a nonprofit institution into a four-profit institution, so they could start to access the capital markets, start getting access to the resources that they need to grow, and then we put together a plan to build a capacity to manage this type of growth. That was about two and a half years ago. They were at 10,000 clients. They're now at 120,000 clients in two and a half years, so more than 10,000 growth in two and a half years. The industry grows about 20% a year, so to give you a benchmark, and they're growing at 250% a year or more. So that's the crux of what we do. We find institutions with that type of potential, latent potential, and we help unlock it, like a venture, a sand-held road venture player might do. So we often hear the saying, doing good as well, as doing well. So are you doing well? Is this a profitable business? Is this something you'd say, wow, this is something that other people should consider doing? Yes, it's the short answer. And here's something for those who want to explore this further. This has at least a 30-year history, a 30-year track record, and it was initially started as a development activity. The way of helping companies or countries or people develop economic development or individual development. And it was a philanthropic activity. It was funded through government sources or philanthropic sources. And that was very important for demonstrating the potential of poor people to repay. I should pause here and say, worldwide repayment rates with these programs hover around 97%. 97% repayment worldwide. And there are about 80 million people now, the latest count who have access to microcreditome or a microlone. 97% of them repaying on time every week. So just amazing, through become a small financial industry. And proving that was possible was a key role for the early donors, donor dollars, and whatnot. But if you go back to the opportunity that I described, 80% market shares just left open there, 80% possibility of reaching these people. That need, it's a 50 billion dollar industry. That need cannot be met with donor dollars. And so there's a movement now that United States is championing and others to say, this is now a business opportunity with incredible social impact. So it's a slight nuanced version of this is a development activity that can cover some of its costs. If it's designed correctly, the same. This is a business opportunity that has incredible social impact. The ultimate double bottom line. So yes, at numerous levels, this is at least can be profitable at the small micro bank level. It can be profitable. Those institutions can be profitable. And there can be profitable investments into those institutions, which is what we're doing. Okay, so this all sounds fabulous from this very high level. The story of the women with the cheese, past rice cheese is pretty compelling. Are there other stories you can tell us that sort of bring this to life? Sure, there are millions of them, literally. I can share another anecdote if you will. A woman that I met in India had, she had four sons and a daughter. And very, very poor. Her husband was a day laborer. She was married young, had children young. And in order to survive and then pay the dowry for her daughter to be married, she had eventually sold all four of her sons into an indentured servitude. Sold them into slavery, bonded labor. And hated doing it, but had to survive somehow. So she got her first loan and bought a water buffalo, basically like a milk cow. And she milked the cow and sold the milk. And then after that, she paid that loan off, she bought another cow or another water buffalo. And eventually built up enough profits to buy back her sons, one by one. And when I had met her, she had just bought back her fourth son, bought them out of bonded labor. So how do you measure the impact of that on the family? Just new pennies. And there are literally millions of stories like that around the world. Wow. So what have been the biggest challenges you faced? I mean, obviously building any business has some hurdles. Sure. One of the biggest challenges we've faced is coming into an established industry that's been successful. That's been, this is the year, the UN declared 2005 the year of micro credit or micro finance. So it's been successful. It's done incredible things. It's helping millions of people around the world coming into an industry like that that's doing incredibly well and doing incredible work in the world. And to say, this can be done better. This can be done differently. And trying to show a different perspective, trying to show a different possibility of this, which is what we're trying to say that if this were to be converted and viewed as a whole, business with an incredible social impact, then not millions would be helped, but billions and be helped. And so the first time I started giving speeches and talking to people in the industry and talking about what we wanted to do, some of it was met with skepticism. Some of them were saying, oh, why hadn't we ever thought about it like that before. And now, so just going around trying to kick up dust and trying to show that things can be done differently with all the inevitable friends that smile with one hand and get ready to stop stabbing the back of the other hand. That's been one of the challenges. Let me describe a little bit about what we've been able to accomplish. We've been doing this for about four years. We have a portfolio of seven partnerships right now around the world. They're collectively reaching almost 500,000 clients and four years. They'll hit that if they haven't hit it soon. They'll hit it in the next couple of weeks, 500,000 clients. They collectively employ about 1,200 people. So, we've got assets of $40 million, $1,000, et cetera. So, just very quickly, we've established scale. And as a counterpoint, that may be fine, you say, but how many do they have when you started working with them? When we started working with these seven portfolio companies, they had 225,000 clients. So, again, a doubling effect very rapidly. So, trying to do that and trying to show that it's been different can be different. Coming in as a new kid on the block, you know, people say, you're arrogant or you haven't thought about this. You haven't thought about the implications of that or you're ignoring it. Track record. So, some of that has been challenging. If you were to do it over again, are there any things you would do differently? I think I would be more aggressive. Yeah. We are ahead of my expectations in terms of what we've been able to achieve. And I think thinking ten times bigger and the work to achieve that is often not ten times harder. And so, I think we thought we were thinking big then. I think I would think bigger and be more aggressive. Great. I want to give you guys a heads up. Then in just a couple of minutes, I'm going to open up the discussion for you and you will be able to ask questions directly. And when you do that, are there microphones in front of you that you pick up and hold down the little button on the top. So, just a couple of minutes. So, give you a little bit of time to think about what questions you have. So, here we have this room of these incredibly talented students. And, you know, it was only a few years ago that you were a student. What sort of advice do you wish you had gotten when you were their age and sitting in auditorium listening to speakers that would have helped you now? That wasn't on the press. That wasn't on the press. That's a great question. I think one thing that I'm going to answer, I'm going to say what I would say to you is I'm sure you all feel something deep in your gut that you can make a difference. You can do something great in the world somehow, whether it be through technology or through health or whatever your specialty is probably a lot of technology here in the engineering department. But, you feel like you've got something that you've got great intellect. You've had strong upbringing. You're getting a great education here. And, you feel like there's something that you can do. And, I'll just say you're right. You can do it. Believe it. If you could fast forward 10 or 20 years down the road and then look back at yourself, say, yeah, I'm going to do it. And then set your sights high and go for it. That sounds like it might sound like a lot of fluff. But, just with the grit and the ingenuity that this valley is known for, build on that and do it. So, now sitting in your chair, now that you've built this, what are your goals going forward from here? I mean, you've got this infrastructure in place. You're having a big impact. If you look forward five or 10 years, where do you hope to be? Great. That's a great question. So, by the end of next year, we want to have reached one and a half million clients, so an incremental million clients through our partnerships. By 2015, just in India, by 2015, we hope to have reached 10 million families, 10 million clients alone just in India. And an additional five million outside of India, so 15 million, 15 by 15, being impacted by this. But the work that we're doing with our partner that I mentioned in India, where we've helped them grow from 10,000 to 110 or 120,000 clients, that work is just the first level, the first order of our impact. The second order impact is, as we demonstrate that this is possible, that we've provided demonstration effect to what's really possible. And we're aiming to provide that demonstration effect to the industry, to think much bigger, and say, ah, that's a much bigger possibility than we thought about before. We also want the capital markets to no longer view this as a charity, as a development activity, but to view it as a business opportunity. And when we start to do that, when the capital markets start to see this as a place to play, the place to put their money, some of the $2 trillion that circulates the globe every day, some of that will go down to these women selling goat cheese in the market. And when that happens, there'll be an incredible change in the way the world is structured. If I can give a vision, if you will, paint a vision for the future. Over a Christmas, for some reason, last year I read the history of Bank of America, started in San Francisco, started in 1905 by an Italian immigrant, started to service Italian immigrants, to bank Italian immigrants, who were currently then unbankable. And he went door to door in the north end, trying to get people to bring their gold out from under their bed and put it in his bank and talk to them about interest and credit and things like this. And it worked incredibly well. You started banking the unbanked. Then 1906, third quake in the fire happened, and third of San Francisco burned down. All of the banks closed down. He took what he had $80,000 in his cash box and he left town. Three days later, he came back. It took the formal banks or whatever you call them, a month to reopen. He came back three days later with two buckets and a plank. And he went down to the war, put those buckets in the plank down with a hand-painted sign that said it's called Bank of Italy then, but he said Bank of Italy, open for businesses usual. And people came up and he started giving loans. He said, I only have $80,000. So I'll tell you what, you want a loan for me? Go get half of what you want to borrow and bring it here, I'll match it. I'll match anything you can go get from your neighbors, from your friends or whatever. So he turned that 80,000 into 160,000. The north end was the first neighborhood to rebuild after the fire. And he said, this is incredible. These people are bankable. This is the art of JP Morgan and that type of banking where they wouldn't have thought of banking in Italian immigrant and Italian immigrant. And so then he opened a branch in San Jose and then expanded throughout California and then throughout the world. By the 50s was the biggest bank in the world. So that was incredible. What a story. So 100 years ago, most of us, I don't know all of your background, most of us wouldn't have been able to get a loan. Just common middle class people. And he started that, he started to transform that. And so I started saying, I'm a Bank of America client. I said, well, how many financial products and services do I have? First I added the Bank of America ones and then I just started adding all of them, counting them up. I stopped at 42. And that sounds like a big number but you have the same, a lot of us have the same. So college loan mortgage. If you have a car loan, if you have a credit card, if you have savings accounts, if you have any kind of retirement accounts, it just starts to really add up. And we take those for granted. We don't realize how important car insurance is. It's required here. We have to have it. So we kind of take it for granted. But if we didn't have car insurance, we'd probably slightly unconsciously be a little more cautious or a little more nervous. But what happens when we get an offender vendor? Also, we're out $5,000. What if we smash up the other car pretty bad? We're out $10,000. What if we total our car and then we're out whatever your car costs, $30,000? What if we total the other person's car? Then we're out $70,000. What if we have terrible health implications, medical emergency, $100,000 to whatever it is that can add up pretty dramatically? That's just car insurance. Well, that type of insurance doesn't exist for half of the world. And so that's just one small sliver in that whole financial spectrum. So if I can paint a vision for the future, what we're trying to do is create financial services for the three billion people who are currently left out, which sound very unglamorous and unsexy. But as you heard from the goat cheese lady story, can literally change people's lives. So that's where we want to go. We want to help drive that type of change and that will literally start to change the way the world works. It's inspiring and I have many, many more questions if you don't, but I'm looking across the room and I bet you have lots of questions. So I will turn the attention to you. Who has a question first on here? And please do pick up the mics. Can you say your names too? Hi, Jeff. I'm just going to wait until the next large growth potential as far as we can make the most out of the restaurants. Good name, Jeff. Where's the next largest growth potential for microfinance? You ask? It's actually, I think in Asia for large scale microfinance and that has to do if you think about this. It doesn't feel too crass, but you think about it from a market perspective. The poverty density in Asia is much greater. So it's much more efficient and quote unquote easy to serve large numbers of people. Africa broad, you know, go from village to village in Africa. It's a lot longer distance poverty density or density period population density, the level of poverty density is a lot lower there. So mostly in Asia. And we're doing work in Kenya. We're looking in South Africa, Southern Africa, I should say South Africa and a couple of other countries. And West Africa, there's a strong credit union movement from the French sort of the French history basically. If you want to talk more afterwards, I'd be happy to talk to you. I'm John. Really too hard question, personal. Do you pre-bolicire, qualify for people even alone too? And if yes, how do you sort of justify the ability to spend for such a small sort of loans? You get the comments there. How does that work? Yeah, great question. Yes, is the quick answer. And the way this works, first of all, we don't give the $100. Anymore, we work with local institutions that give the $100. And the local institutions, local knowledge, local staff, everything that it would take to be effective. And the pre-qualification takes place on at least two different levels. The way most of this works, I'm tempted to go into a microeconomic answer, which may be a bit too much, but I'll just short cut it and say that the way most of this works is pushing the decision to make it work. And the decision to make alone as far down as possible. And so what many programs do is they'll require, so let's say I want to get alone, they'll say great, go get four of your other four friends to come and form a group together. And in essence, co-sign for each other's loans, even though I'm not putting any collateral on the line because they don't have any. I'm co-signing, which means if Tina's going to come with me, I know Tina. I know I trust her, I watch her in business, I know what kind of person she is, and so we'll come together. So actually we become the loan officers and we say, okay, we as a group of five sort of say that we vouch for each other. And the reason that's effective is I have a lot more information about Tina than you would if you were the loan officer trying to make the decision. And that's the first level. The second level is oftentimes counterintuitive. Many programs, pre-screen applicants to make sure they're poor enough. Instead of the opposite, right? Many go into a normal bank, you want to make sure you have enough assets and everything else. Many programs try to make sure that they're poor enough to qualify. For some market reasons, because people who are less poor often have less of an incentive to repay. But also because there's a two-edged thing. There's the business side of things, but there's also the social impact that's trying to be true. So great question, Jonathan. Back and back. Hi, I'm Ms. Teresa. I was wondering if you could expand a little bit upon some of the criticism that you got on your business. You mentioned in the other day fairs. Can you just kind of expand on a couple points of what they're thinking might go wrong or what they think you have considered? Sure. Maybe I'll just focus on the biggest one. And that's on the commercialization of microfinance and taking what had traditionally been in development activity and making it in commercial activity. Many people say that, well, if you're doing that and you're going to transform a nonprofit microfinance program into a for-profit bank or bank type of program, aren't you just recreating the very system that caused the problem in the first place? And there's a concern that if there's only the profit motive as opposed to the philanthropic motive, that if the programs continue to serve the poor, it might be at user's rates. If they're only out to make a profit, that can become onerous on the poor. That it can lead to wrong incentives and things like that. There's another criticism, if you will, that says if microfinance is commercial and is to grow through its own profits, through retaining earnings, there won't be enough retaining earnings to grow rapidly enough. So I'll stop there. There are a lot of extensions to those types of questions. And I'll say the first, address the first one by saying as I described earlier, only 20% of the markets currently being reached with from the donor model. There simply is not enough money to reach all the poor people in the world that can benefit from this. So just from a purely practical perspective, the business model needs to change, if it's going to reach its potential. So just from the idea of making money on the backs of the poor or becoming users or what not a number of things are starting to happen, first is that there's competition that's starting to take place, which helps equal to sort of keep the price down. Basically, so that's one quick answer. There are a lot more in-depth answers, and I'll be happy to talk afterwards if you're interested in some more in-depth answers. And then the last, the criticism of can it only grow through its own profits, that may be true, but it misses the point that when an institution is a four-profit institution, the capital markets can invest. So they can get access to debt from the capital markets, they can build a cap of an equity base that they can leverage off of, et cetera, so that it's not growth through the loan retained earnings, it's growth through the capital markets driving the growth, again just like the San Hill road model. So that was probably too surfacy if you want to talk later, we can talk a bit more. Great, we're going to go this side, over here. Good afternoon, my name is Sherley. You mentioned how things put together for plans, but I'm a care-assisted executive role in the ecosystem, and helping transform these fairly small, non-profit companies into a wider, comfortable, and real-special. Thank you. So the role we play is an advisor, coach, consultant, and a prod. We tried to prod the thinking and help raise the thinking, talk a little bit about how we formally structure our engagements. When we first start working with them, we form a partnership, and we use that term intentionally. And the partnership is to reach a certain growth goal, like the India examples, to reach 350,000 clients. That's the goal. And there are investment components that will bring to that, and then there's the capacity building plan, the growth plan that you're talking about. We then do an institutional diagnostic. We have a tool that we've developed to help identify growth constraints in their infrastructure, whether it be management information systems, or human resource issues, or financial management, or internal controls. There are about 17 different categories that we look at in a great deal of depth. And we do this diagnostic test, if you will, takes about a week, a team of three or four people, and come up with an assessment. That if you were to try to go through the type of growth that we're talking about, these would be the pinch points. And we do that collaboratively. It's not imposed. It's through discussions with management, with senior management, testing systems, et cetera. And then we agree collectively, sitting on the same side of the table, us, and the... But there's another, an entirely different side of things, or very often in urban areas, they'll move to an individual lending model. So more traditional, like you and I would get if we went into a bank, and still modified and appropriate products for the level we're talking about. But that's sort of the next stage. We're seeing that coming now in the evolution of the industry of an individual lending model, where the repayment mechanism is not only the social cohesion, but it's also the desire for future capital. So I know if I don't repay, I'm not going to get my larger loan. So if I get a hundred dollar loan today, six months from now I want a $300 loan, and then eventually a $500 loan, I know I've got to make my payments along the way to do that. So yes, it's great observation, and it's working in some places. It also isn't working in some places. It's difficult in some places. Too many questions. Okay, over here. What is the question about an individual graduating? How important is it for developing countries to have unique identification numbers, like a social security number or a source, so that individuals are in this group, who is not vulnerable to another community? So basically asking some countries having an individual social security number, like there is here, also very insightful question. It's for the long term growth of the industry, it's very important for an individual program to work where they can somehow map the client and identify the client individually, whether it's where their business is located or something unique to the individual. It's not as important, but for the large scale potential growth of the industry, it's very important. There's started to become what they call credit reporting agencies in some countries for microfinance, and this was a theoretical idea that people say, hey, why to take it to the next level, why don't we create some of these credit reporting agencies? And what you've hit upon is exactly one of the first problems they found. Well, how do we uniquely identify some people? A, many countries there isn't a system, there isn't some kind of number or unique identifier. And B, when there is, oftentimes the poorest of the poor that we're talking about don't have access to it for some reason. So yes, you've hit on it, and there's still a fair amount of work that needs to be done. I'm just speaking globally in some places in Mexico, in the other places, they've worked, found some work around them in some way to do it. But yes, there's a difference. Right here. Hi, my name is Tom. We're a chair. We think of it opportunities for undergraduates, areas, and universities to work in and feel that they cannot develop any more business. Right. Another great question. What are opportunities for students or recent grads to work in this? There are a lot of opportunities. I'll just say generically we actually had a Stanford. I don't see him here, but we had someone who's now in their senior year, Stanford, work with us over the summer as an intern working on a very specific project. And we take interns every summer. So if you're interested, we'd love to talk with you. If you want to do some kind of guided study or whatnot program, we'd be happy to talk with you about that. There's a number of other programs that do work in microfinance that we can connect you with. There is a program or an organization called the microcredit summit that uses a lot of student volunteers and interns and a more broadly and economic development, more broadly, the consulting firm. I had a summer job at a consulting firm in college doing on a development project. And that's where I first learned about microcredit. So imagine here, but in many large cities, at least in the US, there are consulting firms that have either a practice that does economic development consulting or they're fully focused on it. And if you'd like afterwards, I can give you in the name of a few. Yes. Yes. Yes. My name is Ayl and I'm from Pakistan and I didn't know that you guys are in India. I've spoken to the guys who've become the hardest answer as well. However, the question that I had was that you spoke extensively about providing microfinance and microcredit. However, in countries like India and Pakistan, there's another need that needs to be addressed. The fact that large number of people are very risk-averse, going to be not yet. So I'll fix mindset of sticking to a job even if it's a minimum wage job. So is there anything that the United or maybe your partner organizations have done in order to address the situation mindset? Yes and no. The no part first. Usually the segment of the population that this is targeting are the unsalaried. People who are already doing something, they don't have some kind of salary. So that's kind of easy one. The bigger one, I think, what's happening, I'm going to take it out of South Asia and take it to Argentina. I was in Argentina about three weeks ago. Argentina until a little while ago was the richest country in Latin America. I don't know if there are any Argentines here. The richest country in Latin America, considered themselves European, rightly so. Strong economy and then everybody knows what happened a few years ago. So the very strong, vibrant middle class, strong tradition, and then recently plunged into economic crisis. Now the middle class has become very poor. There was not a history of this type of entrepreneurship like you're describing. So what we're finding is out of necessity, people are doing this. They're selling shoes or doing whatever they can to survive. When they first started, they view it at the view of it as, I'm just doing this until I get back on my feet again until the economy recovers and whatnot. It's been four or five years and they're starting to be a structural shift where people are now saying, this is kind of cool. I'm working for myself. I'm doing okay. I'm starting to grow. If our partners are doing anything, it's helping facilitate that and demonstrate that this is possible. This is a way of life, if you will, and you can grow to the level that you want to or are capable of. That same thing would apply in South Asia. When I see my neighbor, so I'm going to work every day in the fields and I'm making my 50 rupees a day or less than that 25 rupees a day. But I see my neighbor's wife maybe who has, she bought a milk buffalo with some money and she doesn't go into the fields every day and she's making 200 rupees a day. That's kind of interesting. I wonder if I could do something. So just by demonstrating a possibility and yes, we're hoping to go to Pakistan. That is. Thank you. Great question. We would love to do this type of work in China, but what your question is getting at is accurate. Not quite possible right now. We have encountered government resistance. We generally try to fly under the government radar screen and do our work from the bottom up. But when it comes to making investments, making an equity investment or even placing debt often, there are restrictions on that on foreign direct investment or repatriation of capital, things like this. And so what we've done, two things we've taken a very practical approach and when we have to deal with it, we do and we build the best strategy we can, getting access to local, whatever it is local lawyers, local, whatever can help guide us through the political harass. But we also try to, by the time we hit obstacles, try to have built enough of a presence on the ground and have demonstrated enough of our value that we have something to point to you and say, look, this is what we're trying to do and use that as a platform to negotiate our way through whatever troubles come up. Thanks. Okay. Yeah. You're saying that there's lots of money lenders already all over the place. How many of these people react when we show up? Do they cut their rates or is it no longer profitable for them to put money in your rates? Yeah. So they don't love it. First of all, very often the money lenders are suppliers or landlords. It's not sort of just someone with a shy-locked shingle hung outside their door. Very often someone that the personality has an existing relationship with. And we found that when these programs first start, they're not happy at all. One of our partners in India right now is having some trouble with some local politicians that the money lenders have influenced. They've banded together and have influenced the local politicians to try to shut down this lending program because it's threatening their survival. So, yes, you hit it on the head. They're threatened by this. What they'll do often is they'll either try to bring down their prices or try to change their product, design somehow to compete, but it's difficult for them to. And so often they'll just shift to another segment of the market. They're used to lend to fish vendors and they'll try to do someone else who isn't currently have other options or alternatives. My name is Beth and my question is knowing that the people who you're giving me are an extremely poor. What are the common guarantees that they offer to the money that they have? And how do you, of course, give them one of that? Great, great questions. The guarantee that they offer is their word. It's a trust-based system and the coercion, if you will, is based on either the social bonds that they have. Also, if Tina has a loan and I have a loan and we're co-guarantine that, I'm signing for Tina's loan. She's signing for mine. If there's coercion, I'll say, hey, Tina, you missed your payment. Come on, you got to make your payment, or else I'm not going to get my next loan. So there is that kind of pressure, but there's also support. There's a lot of peer support. So if Tina's been sick and I'll cover her payment for a few weeks, knowing that she'll do the same for me when it's time. So it's not traditional. They're not forced to sign away their refrigerator or whatever asset they might have. They usually don't have those types of assets or their DVD player because they don't have assets to start with. So it's this trust-based system. So the coercion is, frankly, their word. And it's counterintuitive because of a lot of what we've been taught in formal structure. But fundamentally, people are good and trustworthy. And so this builds on that fundamental premise and builds in mechanisms and safety mechanisms and support mechanisms to build on. But that's fundamentally what is character-based lending. Okay. One more question. This fellow, right in the back. Hello. My name is Eric. I'm wondering what kind of returns are we getting for? Is it trying to gain from, in fact, we can use micro letters and what do we get during that? Great. So what kind of returns do we get or hope to get? And where do we get our capital? And I'll describe quickly our structure. We have a hybrid structure where we have some for-profit entities and not-for-profit entities and non-profit entities. And so that gives us three buckets of financing that we can use to do the type of work I described. We can give grants when the programs are working with their nonprofits. We can give grants to help start the process, the commercialization process. We can give them loans or debt, quasi-debt, sorts of variants on debt. And we can take equity positions in the company. So the return expectations are different for each of those on the grants. Obviously no return expectation on the debt returns are about money market rates. We charge commercial rates to the institution, but the transaction costs to get the money from here to there and back take away most of that. So one to four percent on the debt. And then on the equity side returns can be, I guess, formally and publicly we say 8 to 11 percent. They can be in the teens. They can be higher. This is a growth play. If you can imagine if you bought 20 percent of that company that it described when they had 10,000 clients, you go to 120,000 clients and you did an exit and you owned just a 20 percent of that company. This is pretty substantial returns that you can expect there. So you can see how that would work. And our funding, our capital comes mostly from families, high net worth families, wealthy individuals in the US, in Canada, in Europe, who, like I described earlier, have, or see this as a business opportunity with the social impact. So social investor type who see the commercial promise and the investment side of this, but also understand that it's doing good in the world. So before we officially say thank you. I want you to just look around this room and see that we have faces from people all over the world. Yes, I noticed that. You are having a big impact. And I think everybody here is going to go back and tell their friends and colleagues about all the cool things you're doing. I also want, before we say thank you, to let you know that this is the first of many fabulous talks. Next week we have Evan Williams, who is a president and founder of ODO that is a podcasting company. And in fact, just to let you know, inspired by Evan and by ODO, we are podcasting all of the ETL lectures this year. And in fact, the first one is this one, I forgot to mention it. So if you go to several of the websites, we'll be happy to let you know. You'll be able to get the podcast as this as well.
