 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. It is my sincere pleasure to welcome Lisa Lambert here. She is a partner at the venture capital from Intel Capital. And to get things started since we're going to do a little bit of an interview today, maybe you can set the stage by telling us a little bit about Intel Capital. Intel Capital, absolutely. How many have heard of Intel Capital? So everybody has heard of Intel, but the capital division is a little more of a secret I suppose. But we are not unlike most traditional VCs. The primary difference is that we're a strategic investor. So as we're investing to make a financial return like traditional venture capital firms, we also need to generate strategic value for Intel. I got a couple of slides that actually can refer to you if I can get them to move. Maybe not. That's okay. So the main difference is if you look at Intel Capital, we like to invest in areas that help us essentially sell silicon, whether that's into consumer market segments or enterprise market segments or mobile market segments. So traditional VCs typically only invest to make a financial return. We'll pass on a great financial deal to do a deal that's going to produce strategic value. So that's an important criteria for us. Great. So what is the relationship between Intel and Intel Capital? I mean, are these completely separate companies or how do you work together? It's actually the vision of Intel. So we're a business unit just like any other PNLs. We're responsible for producing a profit. Hopefully not generating a loss. We have done that for quite a while, so that's a good thing, despite the difficulties that VC has had in general as an industry. And we work with the operating businesses. As you would expect, we have within Intel Capital a president that runs the group. Within that, we have managing directors like myself who are responsible for PNLs. So we're responsible for supporting the different product groups. We've got myself that covers our software and services group. We've got somebody else that covers the mobility group, another person that covers the digital enterprise group, the data center group. And we invest in partnership and on behalf of. So we're kind of eyes and ears for the company. But we're also privy to the strategic roadmaps of those divisions. And we're supposed to be investing in companies that support sales of Silicon into any of those market segments. So how big is the group? How many people are there? We're currently about 250 people, which is actually a pretty big venture capital organization. You guys probably know most of the firms are eight to 15 partners. We have seven managing directors who are responsible for these technology domains, the PNLs. And then we have four geographic managing directors. And within those groups, we have investment managers. Typically a team is somewhere between five and 10 investment professionals. So about 100 worldwide. And then we also have support organizations. So we have our own business development organization. We have our own marketing and PR organization. We have portfolio management. We have the mergers and acquisitions group. And we're responsible for not only equity investing, but we're responsible for making strategic acquisitions on behalf of Intel. So maybe you could tell us about some of the few examples of the type of investments you've made to give us a little bit more color commentary on what type of things you're interested in. Absolutely. So some of the bigger names, companies like VMware, you guys on the VMware, the virtualization machine company, that was an investment that I actually led. It was a 218.5 million dollar deal. All of our deals aren't that big, but we do a number of them that are very big. And we also invest in it to come to you called ClearWire, which is a YMAX infrastructure company. We actually put a billion dollars in that over the period of about two to three years. Now the typical investment for us probably averages something on the lines of 8 to 10 million initial. And then there's the investments that are follow investments over the life of the company. So some of the brings up a question of how different are you from a traditional venture capital firm? I mean, if we go down to Santo Road and ask them similar questions, how different will their answers be? I mean, these numbers, the size of these investments are incredible, relative to what I think of when I think of a traditional venture capital firm. That's probably one of the major differences. I would categorize it in really two categories, the type of deal that we do because we're strategic focus. Oftentimes the deals that we do are larger to create a bigger impact. They're also always accompanied with a business agreement, some sort of commercial agreement or how we're going to use the technology, how we'll work with the technology to tune or optimize it on Intel platform. So that's a major difference. We're state-agnostic. So a lot of VCs these days are state-agnostic. I think many of them started out as early stage, but early stage is a little bit about a favor because capital requirements and a lack of liquidity have inhibited a lot of firms from doing very, very early. It just takes a long time to go from start-up idea to a liquidity event. During the boom days, this is an aside. During the boom days, it was like 2.6 years to get liquidity. And today, the latest average from NVCA at the Natural Mentor Capital Association is 8.7 years. So you're investing over the long haul, better to get a later stage company where you can make a quick return. So that would be a major difference. So speaking of returns and liquidity, what percentage of the companies that you invest in do you actually just Intel end up acquiring? It's actually a pretty small number. And our objective for equity is to produce strategic impact, to help us sell more silicon into new geographic markets, to help us enter new markets, whether it's entering the embedded space or adding the smart-film space, both areas that we haven't done a lot in historically. So we typically don't invest to acquire. I'd say it's probably less than 1% of the deals that we do that we actually acquire. So I think when you, I love this idea of investing to sell more silicon somewhere in the world. But you can go pretty far up the pipeline there. I mean, I can imagine saying, well, gee, we're educating all these students in this room and all the people who are listening. And those people are going to all go buy computers. So do you invest in education because the more educated people are, the more technology they're going to use? As a sector within ICAP, not so much. I'm just hoping for it. She's starting to get some stand for money. I can tell. She's always selling. That's good. I like it. Not so much. We do, of course, work with the universities because there are brilliant students like yourselves that generally leave this institution and go run companies. So we do invest our time and our resource to sponsor events and such. But when it comes to equity investing, we're purely investing in technology. Okay. Let's say a group of students in the room here came and we're going to give a pitch to you. What would be the key things that you would be evaluating? You've got, I'm sure, a little set of metrics, a little dashboard in front of you that you're sort of looking at all sort of key criteria. What's on your dashboard? Sure. Well, the first thing is did you bring money? A gift. You know, thanks to the butter up the investor. Okay. You know, kind of basic things. Things that you would expect. Things are all smart. I mean, you've been looking at business plans and probably writing your own business plans. We're looking for, you know, is the team credible? You know, do you have a track record? Have you ever done this before? If you're a student, obviously, maybe not have a track record. And it certainly didn't matter in Zuckerberg's case with Facebook startup. But do you have some experience, some knowledge on how to build a company, how to take a company market? That's number one. Number two is the idea credible. You know, is it a real product? Is it solving a real problem? Is the market significant enough that you can actually build a business that's going to be attractive in the long term? And then the technology is it unique? You know, is it differentiated? Does it do something that existing technology does not do? Do you have patent protection? Do you have intellectual property that is sellable? So those would be the top three things that we'd look for. Great. Do you typically invest alongside other venture capitalists? I mean, is this typically that's the model? Is that there are these groups of VCs who invest together? Do you do this as well? We do. We do, actually. And we started off. I mean, until capital was born back in 1990. So we've been doing this for quite some time. I joined the group in 1999. So I've been doing this for over a decade now. It's amazing. How time flies. But what was the question? Because I'm investing alongside other VCs. Oh, yeah, that's indication thing. Yeah, I'm getting that. All right. So yes, we do. We started off doing only syndication. So we literally would not invest independent of a partner. And we typically only invested with what we call tier one venture capital firms. So we only did follow on investments when there was a lead. Today, we've opened it up a bit. So we are leading our own investments. We've got a number of deals that we've done by ourselves. But we've also just recently launched a program called our Investment Syndicate Program. We've actually signed up almost two dozen now venture capital firms that we've done a lot of deals with. We have a history with, a track record with. And we are then offering them proprietary, if you will, deal flow. We've got a 100 investment professionals global. We see companies in every geography. We've done investments in 47 different countries on every continent. So we're sharing that deal flow with our investment syndicate partners. And it helps us in that we've got ready money that's available to go invest with us. It helps them because they don't have the reach that we do. So we get them deal flow that they would normally have access to. So one of the things that, when we hear from other VCs, they talk about smart money. They talk about the fact that they're going to be sitting down next to you and helping you out and going through their roller decks and making contacts. Is that the sort of thing you do? How involved do you get with these companies that you're investing in? Variables. I think most VCs think we're done money because we're a corporation, but in reality, we're not. Don't tell them I said that. I promise. But we do a lot to help. In fact, that's one of the things that we focused on in the past four or five years, especially. There are so many venture capital firms in the world now. I mean, I think there's some consolidation going. I've got some great slides to show you to that point. But for some reason, we're not projecting. But we bring a number of things. I'll give you a couple of things that we bring. One thing we do annually is what we call the Antocopal CEO Summit. And this is a forum where we bring our 400 portfolio companies together for matchmaking, not only with themselves, amongst themselves, but we invite about 200 industry executives. And these are sea level people in various industries, well, in gas, manufacturing, high-tech, et cetera. The objective there is to create a forum for them to make pitches, essentially, to these prospective customers and prospective partners. So that's one major event. We do a smaller version of that about 75 to 80 times a year called Intel Capital Technology Days. And these are specifically customer forms where we have our business development organization. They have access to Intel customers, end user customers, like Shell, like IBM, et cetera, named your Fortune 1000 company. And they're uninterested. And finally, what's happening in technology? They don't have an external R&D department. They don't have anybody that's out-prevain, surveying technology companies. So what we do is we bring the technology innovators together with these Fortune 1000 companies. They select the categories they're interested in, whether it's cloud computing or mobile software or software as a service. They select the categories. And then they select the companies in our portfolio that are aligned with those categories. And we literally do a full day where those companies, the CEOs from those companies, pitch to sea level decision makers around technology or strategic partnership. They pitch their idea, their wares. And in many cases, we get proof concepts. We get closed sales. So what this does for the portfolio company significantly reduces the sales cycle. I mean, for them to get in with a Disney and to close a deal literally, or at least the concept of a deal in a day is just unheard of. I mean, we take months for these companies to close deals. So that's a form that we create. We've got, in addition to that, we've got advisory boards. We've got what we call acquisition ITDs where if a company is approaching the point of liquidity, we line up prospective buyers. Because we've got relationships with all the major ISVs. So those are some of the things that we do. It's unprecedented because we've got, as I say, this very large organization. We've got resources in every geography. So even if they want to enter a new market, if they're launching their business from the US and want to start to make inroads into other developed regions like Western Europe, for example, we've got a team of people that already have relationships in those areas and can help up indoors for them. So I think if you compare it, it's super smart money and a corporate and maybe less smart money to mature for. Interesting. So I know you're a very, very busy person. Because even just trying to get a phone call schedule takes weeks and weeks. So what is your typical day like? What are you doing? Are you spending most of your time listening to pitches? Are you spending your time helping companies? Are you talking with your colleagues? What's happening all day long? Yeah, it's just meetings. It's one meeting after another. I've got 70 companies in my sector. Intel Capital has about 400 companies in the overall portfolio. 70 of those are software and services. I personally sit on six boards. I've got a staff of about seven investment professionals. Plus we work with the geographic investment teams. So if there's a software deal in Ukraine, then it's co-owned with my group. So we have a lot of responsibility not just for the US or North America, but globally. So I do, everywhere from company meetings with prospects to portfolio company reviews, where we're trying to make deeper connections in the business unit for them. Or we're trying to introduce them with another portfolio company, or we're trying to help them sell the product. So we're meeting with those folks. I do a lot of internal meetings because we're strategic organization, we need to be involved in all the strategic processes of the divisions. So if there's a corporate strategic discussion around Adam and Migo and the mobile execution platform, then I need to be in that meeting. So we do a lot of strategic reviews with our business unit counterparts. And then that traditional management stuff. So I've got a staff and they're doing deals. And I need to review their deals and provide coaching and management support for what they do. How many deals do you do a year in your group? In my group, last year was a bit of an odd year. We actually did about 20 investments. But the vast majority of those were follow-on deals. So these were investments in our existing portfolio. Typically, we do 12 to 14 new investments a year in my sector, and somewhere between 10 and 14 follow-on investments. So 2009 was a very, very difficult year for venture capital. Probably a good year in that it's shaking out the industry a bit. It's a bit bloated. If you look at some of the slides I have here, there's huge capital overhang. You went from the boom days. Actually, you went from the 80s where capital inflows were relatively small. It was a pretty small industry. And then you got the peak during the bubble. And then you've got a flat to slightly up and then back down again in 2009, fund raising environment in the recent past. So there are a tremendous number of VCs. Consolidation is actually good. The correction is actually good. But it definitely has made the deal flow dynamic a bit different than in the past. So I'm curious. All of these deals have to be negotiated. What are the terms that are the most challenging to negotiate in these deals? This is something that's always a big black box. I know what I think of going in and pitching and negotiating a deal is to figure out what are the terms that people really should be thinking about. Yeah. Well, evaluation is always the biggest issue. People want high prices for their companies. I don't even think about it. These are entrepreneurs who have kind of blood sweat and tears, time, and they expect to get a premium for their companies. And in an environment like the one we have right now, premiums are rare. So evaluation is always the first obstacle. If you can get through valuation, then it's really the other financial terms. So for example, participation, as basically a term that says, you're going to participate in the event of an M&A. You're going to participate above what your liquidation preference allows you to participate. So it just means you get more money. And that more money comes from somebody, generally comes from the other investors in the management team. So that's an area that most companies don't want. Thank you. It's going to be perfect. Most companies don't want participation, so you have to negotiate that. And then they're all the protected provisions. So these are things like, how much control do you have over the company? Control regarding a budget. Regarding strategic changes in direction. Regarding decisions on sales, acquisition, debt, et cetera. So those are all explicitly stated in the protected provisions. You have to negotiate each line item. And so depending upon how much control you want over the company, those can be more difficult to get. Do you find that negotiating with a seasoned entrepreneurial team is very different than negotiating with someone who's coming at it the first time? I think yes and no. The first time was generally really paranoid, so it's hard to even get them at the table. The more seasoned entrepreneurs, those aren't necessarily more difficult negotiations. You might think they were because these people know how to negotiate a term sheet. They understand the language. They've done this before. But they also, I think in my experience, they have a better perspective on real value. And some of the novices fight for things. They really shouldn't be fighting for it. And the senior and more mature teams tend to understand the value that we bring as a company to them as a portfolio company. And they're willing to negotiate on things like participation. And whether we have a revenue ratchet or whether we have a protective provision around debt. So it actually, you would think that you could get away with a lot more from an office. And we typically find that those are a little more difficult negotiations. Because they want to negotiate every single point. Even the things that might not be as important. That's right. They assume that you're out to take it to them. Imagine that. So let's say I want to switch gears a little bit here. And as we switch gears, I want the folks in the audience to think about questions you might have. Because we're going to leave a bunch of time at the end for you guys to ask your questions. So keep your questions coming later. When you were a student, could you imagine that you would be sitting in this seat here doing this? I mean, is this what you envisioned for your career? I wish I could say yeah. And I thought it all out. And knew this was where I would end up. But I absolutely had no idea that I would be doing this. So what did you do? And what was your background? Tell us your story. Yeah, actually, I started as a software developer. So I have my bachelor of science from Penn State and New Lions go Penn State and information systems. So I was a software developer right out of college. Really kind of went into that, not thinking that I was going into that. I mean, I started off as a pre-law student. And then I took a couple of business law classes and I said, there's no way in the world. I hope you don't have any pre-laws in here. But the minutia, the amount of detail, volumes and volumes of case law was just a little bit of an absolute insane. So I got out of that and got into programming. It was more gratifying. You get a response fairly quickly to a program that you've written and to me that made more sense. So did that? Started off as a software developer. I worked back in my hometown. I'm a Toledoin from Ohio. And wanted to go back home to be with family. So joined a big company there and started off in IT. I was a software developer. And then got an itch in for something more. I thought I'd be a general manager. Once I got over the law thing, I thought, OK, I'll just go run a big company. That sounds good. Run a big company. So I started actually a business rotation. I talked my management into putting me on a rotation where I'd get experience in a number of functional areas. So it actually started off in sales. And then I did a marketing stunt. And then I did a strategic planning stunt. And then I did a new business where actually launching a new business at the company. And I worked on the product marketing team for that. So I thought, that's perfect. Right? It's giving me the experience as an operator, functional area, expertise. Now all I need is an MBA. So went with Harvard and got my MBA and thought I would go and do general management. And I knew I wanted to get back in high tech. I never really worked in the high tech industry. I worked for Owens Corning, which is an industrial consumer technology company, building materials company. And I knew I wanted to work in the high tech field. So interviewed with a number of high tech companies. Got a number of offers. Decided to go to Intel because it was a great platform. Right in the heart of Silicon Valley, big brand, big name, lots of access to many opportunities. And worked initially as a product marketing engineer, which essentially was technical marketing translation. Right? I worked on the enterprise side of the business. So I put together basically marketing materials that would be used by our end user customers. Right? Through our channel. Right? Which at the time was OEM. So Dell, HP, compact at the time. And I did that for a body year. And I got promoted to product marketing managers. So I was managing a bunch of product marketing engineers. And did that for about another year. And realized that this wasn't it neither. I didn't really want to do technical marketing and product marketing. So I went looking around Intel. And Intel is a great company, love Intel. But it's a Silicon company. So the products didn't change a whole lot. The market segments change. So you could work on the enterprise side at desktop or you could work on the enterprise side in server or on the enterprise side in mobile or the consumer side in mobile. But it was basically the same kind of idea, the same kind of process, same kind of product. And I didn't want to do that again. So it was either find another place in Intel that I could work or leave Intel. And I was seriously considering leaving Intel when I stumbled on what was then called corporate business development. We were later changed the name to Intel Capital. And it was so different than anything at Intel Capital. We spent 80% of our time working outside of the company, working with entrepreneurs. It was the most dynamic and interesting and innovative creative job that I had imagined. And it was the perfect application of my skills. I mean, I had technical to re-evalve software developer. And now I've got all this business experience working in these different operational areas. I've got the MBA to go with it. And I was ready to go and make investments. So that's how I stumbled upon it. And it was through a lot of work and some favor along the way with opportunities to do these rotations. And really good timing because in the late 90s you all know the .com internet era was born and that's when I started investing. Very cool. Now, curious. A company like Intel has to be really innovative. I mean, they're constantly pushing the envelope in terms of technology and it's very competitive market. How does a company that big? I mean, maybe you give us a little bit of insight from all your experience there. Really, well, does it? If so, how does it do? Maintain this level of innovation inside such a big company. It's difficult. As you get older as a company and as an individual, probably, your mindset about change diminishes somehow. You're less creative. You're less willing to experiment. You've got more stake, more at risk if you fail. So it's been a difficult task, I think, for Intel. Fortunately, they had some great founders and great early CEOs and in the current generation of CEO and executive staff is quite good. They continue to push the envelope. They continue to challenge their assumptions and not be complacent. And so I think that's a part of the culture of innovation. You need to have that. Startups have that. Entrepreneurs get that intuitively. And even smaller companies that are maybe public but aren't 40 billion in revenue like Intel is. They are able to harness that creative energy and they continue to bring in new people with new ideas. And that's the culture that you foster if you want to be an innovator. And I think Intel has done a pretty good job of that. We've reinvented ourselves more than once and I suspect we'll continue to do that. Adam is a great example. Adam is our netbook, micro architecture, and we're going to be selling that into smartphones and we're probably going to be selling that into embedded devices as well. So Intel moving out of traditional PC domain and server domain where we've gotten our name into some new market segments. Consumer electronics, the works. So that's a part of it. Well we all know that if you're going to take some calculated risks you're going to have some failures. And I'm wondering did you have any failures along the way in your career? Is anything you want to share with us? Nothing I want to share with you. I mean really, it sounds like a story. The story you told that sounds like this wonderful path of just opportunity opportunity opportunity. I mean was there any and we all know that usually the path doesn't look so clear and clean. Any stumbles along the way? Absolutely. I think the failure is as much a part of success as success is. In fact it's probably a more important part. Abraham Lincoln said it's not whether you've failed that concerns me. It's whether you're content with a failure. So expect that you're going to fail. I mean don't be pessimistic and kind of pressed about it but expect that along the way you're going to make mistakes. And I certainly have made my fair share. I think a couple of things that I probably underestimated when I was in college. The whole work life balance thing. I mean you guys don't really think much about it now. I mean because it's unlimited time and unlimited energy is what you have right now. I mean you're living on a adrenaline right? Drone adrenaline and candy or junk food. Not all of us. But when you get to become my age, which you don't need to know. But when you're over 25. You mean like 27? Yeah. Things change. And managing all of your interests in a way that keeps you healthy and happy is really, really difficult. I mean there's so many things you have to say no to. That's the word that you, you know, you really want to get practice with while you're in college. Just because you're not going to be able to do everything that you want to do. There's not enough time today. There's not enough bandwidth that you have to do all the things that you want. So finding a way to balance, you know, your spiritual life, your recreational life, your professional life, your family life, all the things that matter to you. The sooner you get practiced with that, the better. You're going to have to make some really difficult decisions and trade-offs as you mature in your career. And I guarantee you that will be one of the things that you struggle with the most. And I don't know that I can give you advice on how you prepare for that now. But just begin to think about your universe as being limited. It's not unlimited. You don't have unlimited time. You don't have unlimited budget. You don't have unlimited resource. It feels that way when you're 19 or 20. You really don't have that. So start making good decisions, time management, budget, etc. Those things will help you. So how often do you reassess this? I mean, I know some people who sort of are like fire and forget missiles. You know, they start getting on a path and five years later, 10 years later, then look up and say, oh my gosh, how do I get here? And other people are reassessing their lives every 10 minutes. What's your sort of drum beat for reassessing your life? Yeah. That's a good question. I think over my career at Intel, I generally have taken kind of two-year increments. I think about myself in a job for a couple of years. If I'm still enjoying it in those two years, then I'll sign up for a couple more years. And you're doing introspection and evaluation along the way. But it's kind of a two-year decision point for me. And that's actually worked out pretty well. It wasn't this studied and preconceived notion. It just kind of came to me that I'll do a job for two years. I've had the end of that two years. I'm not satisfied. I'll love my first couple of years at Intel. It was a two-year assignment. It was a product marketing engineer, then product marketing management, and that was out. After that, because it wasn't satisfying to me. So that cadence that pace has worked for me. You need to find a pace that works for you. Because invariably what happens, again, this whole work-life balance thing, as you get older in your career, in some cases, it will become easier to just staying something that you're not happy with. To just, because it's less disruptive, you don't have to deal with change and complexity. And you really don't ever want to be that way. If you're not doing what fires you up, what turns you on, what gets you excited and motivated to get up every day, if you're not doing that quit it, to stop. Because you will spend the rest of your life doing something that you don't like, and you'll end up resenting it. And you'll have no one to blame but yourself, because you decided not to make a change, because it was inconvenient. So have a pace, have a cadence, have an evaluation process. Don't obsess about it. It's not a ten-minute, every ten-minute kind of a thing. But you should have, I set period of time where you just really look back and say, is this where I expected that I would be? And if it's not, is it where I want to be? Am I happy here? Do I enjoy this? Am I satisfied? Do I get gratification out of it? Do I have the kind of life, the quality of life, that, you know, I said at an early age that I want it to achieve? You should be asking those questions. Well, I love the energy that sparked, and you when you answer this question. So I wonder, what makes you want to get up in the morning? I mean, what is it that, you know, the obviously, you know, the way you talk, you really love what you're doing? What is it about what you're doing that really fires you up? Well, it's essentially, for the woman in the audience, it's like you got a really big pocket book with a lot of money in it, and you could go shop every day. It's a no-brainer. I mean, come on. It's a no-brainer. So we've got this resource, 16 billion in cash from Intel, which is a not pocket change. And we get to work with the most innovative and interesting creative minds in the world, not just in the valley, in the world. It's the most dynamic job, and that, you know, one day I'm focused on cloud companies, the next day I'm focused on mobile companies, the next day I'm focused on software as a service, and the next day I'm focused on clean tech software. I mean, it's so dynamic that, you know, the technology acumen and the business acumen that you need to develop to be able to do that efficiently is tremendous. And so it keeps you on your toes, it keeps you sharp, it keeps me studying, it keeps me reading, it keeps me talking to companies and talking to smart people. I network with those people because I'm learning from them. So if you like dynamic, if you like change, if you like innovation, if you want to be, you know, a thought leader, the reason that we're here today, a thought leader class, then it's a great place for you because that's essentially what we do. And we get to go and invest in tells money, right, and ideas and concepts that we believe in. And even more gratifying is that we get to see the end result of it. We get to invest when it's an idea and we get to see an exit as in the case of J-Boss one of my companies or in the case of Data Allegro, another one of my companies or my SQL and other one of my companies. We get to see from start to finish a company, a team, a product, mature, and develop, and really meet the needs of its customer base. It's so gratifying, very gratifying. So that's what gets me excited. I love my job. Well, you should love your job. Don't do anything you don't love. Gosh, I know too many people that are just miserable and they're work and it's because, you know, they've resigned themselves to, I got a family now, I got a mortgage, I don't have very many options, I need a job. And at some point, they stop having goals. At some point, they stop having dreams. So find out what you like and it's not going to be, I can guarantee you, it won't be a direct course and it absolutely won't be what you expect it to be now. But find it and then stay with it and continue to evaluate what you like about it and make a change if you're not satisfied. What a terrific answer. So my last question before I open it up is, when you were sitting in school, when you were even at Harvard Business School or when you were in college at Penn State, what do you wish someone had told you? Or what do you wish you had learned that later ended up being really valuable? Or did you just have to learn these things by the, you know, seat of your pants in the workforce? Yeah, I reflect on it because it's a difficult question. There's so many things. You know, did you take enough math and science courses? You know what I mean? Did you make connections with people, particularly in the NBA domain when you're, you know, a little more mature in your career? Did you make the right connections? Are you networking enough? You know, do you have balance in your life? Those are things when I reflect back on my life. Those are the things that I wish maybe I'd spend a little more time on or gotten a little more coaching on. You know, and take advantage of the network that you have. A lot of people think that, you know, you're going to have one mentor in your life or one person that's really a significant contributor to your development and maturity. The reality is it's a composite of probably hundreds of people over the, you know, the timeline of your career. Don't underestimate that and make sure you're proactive about asking questions. You know, continuous learning. It sounds cliche and it sounds kind of trait, but it's really true. You want to learn from the people that you're around. You want to learn from your teammates. You want to learn from your classmates. You want to learn from the professors. Just be inquisitive, be hungry. And I think had somebody really emphasize that, I think I'm naturally inquisitive, but I think if somebody really emphasized that early, I probably would have a broader experience and maybe even a broader acumen across the number of different domains that I do now. And I'm doing that proactively now, but God, over the course of my life, the context that I could have made, the people that I could have met, the knowledge that I could have acquired, I think that would have been invaluable. So take advantage of the time that you have now. Again, it's that time management budgeting your time. Make sure you make time for social networking, for developing mentor relationships and for continuous learning. Terrific. Okay, so what about some questions from the audience? Great. You mentioned having done a billion dollar deal in the past with Clearwire. I was just curious if you had taken a look at Paul and what your thoughts were on the recent deal with HP. I personally did not evaluate PUM as an investment opportunity, but we obviously know them quite well. I think the acquisition to be was surprising. Surprising in that they really haven't made a foray into smartphones at all. Not surprising in that they could see the market is growing. I mean, just to give you some data, the number of smartphones shipments this year is 210 250 million. That's going to be 200, 400 million by 2012 and a billion by 2013. So they're looking at that market and they're saying we don't have a play. And if it's going to be as big as it is, not only does it perhaps give us a play in smartphones, but it could also give us a play and embed it if they get into the Silicon business. Now they can also look into embedded devices, which is expected to be a 28 billion dollar market, 28 billion device market by 2020. So it's surprising in that it's a departure from their current strategy, but not surprising if you think about the mobile opportunity. We personally didn't invest in PUM, obviously, but we have invested in some device makers like RIM, which is one of our investments, not in my area, but somebody else. Another question? Yep. So since you are a strategic corporate investor, is there ever a concern from a company that you're investing in that maybe there are misaligned incentives and how do you manage that? Concern from whose perspective? You're obviously trying to sell more silicon and make deals that are beneficial until itself. And I'm curious if maybe there's companies that are speaking to that are worried that they have interest that might be different from yours and if that were the case, then how do you manage something like that? Yeah, at times it is. It's rare that we invest in somebody that we might compete with. But we still have a CNTS, a code and not to sue agreement that we do ask companies that are close to us or maybe in a business that we expect to be in. We do get that signature before we invest in that company. In the software domain, the conflict is more rare. You probably would be surprised though that from a head count basis, Intel is the 8th largest software company in the world in terms of head count. We have that many software engineers, software developers within our company. By that said, from a business standpoint, we don't have a lot of software business yet. We've got ReroRoo, we've got Havec, we've got a few other assets. So the conflict is generally not there. When it is there, we make sure we have a CNTS and we make sure there's clear understanding as to what we're going to do with the companies and the commercial agreements or the business agreements so that there is no conflict. And if there is an expectation that this equity investment is really kind of a phased acquisition, we make that known up front as well. Because in some cases, we will do that. It's less than 1% of our deals most likely, but we've done literally thousands of deals over the years. It does happen from time to time. This being very clear about expectations up front and managing the communication process, generally, not too much of an issue. What do you think is the difference in value between a VC firm like Intel Capital versus a traditional VC firm? And especially when you two are investing on the same deal, what do you think you guys bring differently to a table? Every deal is different, but I mentioned a couple of things that we do. Probably the biggest, most obvious thing is just scale. In terms of our resource and reach, we bring engineering, we bring marketing, go to market, we bring channels, we bring business development relationships, customer relationships, the talks about ITDs and CEO Summit. So we've got huge scale, which really just is unmasked. There isn't another investor, strategic or otherwise, that competes with us on that level. Intel Capital is ingrained in the culture of Intel Corporation. And so we really do believe strategically about the deals that we do. Many corporates don't. They're investing for financial reasons. Or there is a much looser alignment with the strategic we're operating businesses. So scale, real company building, not just capital, but we're helping it close deals. We're helping to make introductions to partners. We're helping to really build the company. We sit on a board just like all the other venture capital firms. Oftentimes we're observers, classified as observers rather than directors because of the fiduciary risk. And if there's a lawsuit, and Intel's a director, then we get the deepest pockets, we're probably going to get sued. So we typically don't do the director thing, but we add all the value that a director would. We're helping with recruiting, we're helping with operations. We're there, very hands on with the company. Again, if it's a deal that's a purely technology deal, like VMware for example, or clear where those are two examples, Micron as another good example, where we already had a strategic relationship with them, we were already doing a boat load of things with them strategically. We can add a lot more value, right? If that's the case, because we've already got pretty significant relationships and it's not really not just about capital in those cases. Great. Another question? There's been a lot of discussion going around about the relative profitability of VC as an asset class relative to other things, and then flatline over the past ten years without the bubbles being in there, just curious on your thoughts of the industry as a whole. Yeah, it's in trouble. It really is in trouble. I just want to repeat it because it wasn't able to hear it on the podcast. The question is basically, what's your attitude towards VC in general? What's your prognosis? Yeah, the industry in general is in trouble. There's a huge amount of capital access, a severe lack of liquidity. Things are improving now, but the past couple of years have been pretty bad, and we had some improvement post the bubble bursting in 9-11, but still, we're well off the height of our industry in the 90s. So as an asset class, I think they'll continue to be consolidation. I think LPs will continue to look for other areas. I think the thing that VC does bring that other asset classes don't is that innovative element. You're going to get the next big idea. You're going to get the next Facebook. You're going to get the next Microsoft, and you're probably going to get it in a lot of different geographic markets. So there's still a value proposition for it. We haven't seen the industry really, really shake out in that as an asset class. It's decreasing as a percentage of the portfolio of a typical LP. It's still about what it has been, but the industry itself is shrinking, which I think is actually good for it, and hopefully will produce better returns as there are more or fewer rather companies competing for the number of deals that are out there. Right now, there's just too much money, chase, and too few deals. So, yep. We're going here and then we'll move on to the other side. We've been running the issue of your selling portfolio company, and people are like, you know, it's a tech company, and it's so great why I would intel why I'm selling. Because you do cite the strategic reason why you want to bring it in-house, I guess you can cite the fact that you use your common practices only paying it on to one percent of the amount of minutes. Yeah, it's rare that we certainly don't publicize if we're doing a private sell on the company. Is that what you're referring to? If you were trying to sell to another VC firm or some other exit, the potential investor would say, what does Intel know about this idea? The inter-tech who produced it? Yeah, that's generally the case for a private sell though. So if there's a liquidity event, then everybody's out, right? If there's an IPO, then most cases venture capital firms and IPOs sell with the IPO. They sell with the IPO or they sell post the lockup period, which typically is six months. So that's not abnormal. Does it mean a lock of faith really is kind of what the industry does in the case of an IPO? In the case of an M&A likewise, you know, it's an M&A. So they're going to be bought by another company and we're all going to get liquid. Though in the case of a private sell, I think that would be most relevant to your question. We do on occasion, we don't publicize it, but we do on occasion sell our equity stake to other venture capital firms. And we do it for a number of reasons. In some cases, we have a very high percentage of the company and we just want to get some liquidity because of our current stake. In some cases, you know, we've perhaps gone a different direction strategically within the business. And so from a technology standpoint, it's a orphaned, if you will, right? It doesn't have an owner, a business unit owner within the company. So it doesn't make sense for us to maintain our positions. It's we're so focused on strategic value. So we'll sell to other VCs in those cases. And in some cases, it may be a situation where, you know, we think there's no financial or strategic upside. And so we'll get liquid just because we don't think there's a return for us. But those are generally private sales of our shares. We don't publicize that and those are some of the reasons why we might do it. And the other liquidity cases, everybody gets liquid. So we don't look strange in those cases. Yep. So to what extent does the investors make, as Intel, affect on your personal contribution as your personal job? Yeah. And does this create stress whenever you make an investment? Oh, heck yeah. Well, I think the question is, is there a personal upside or a global downside? Yes, the answer is yes. There is. We're like VCs and that we are compensated based upon the financial and strategic return of our investments. So if you have a really bad couple of years and you've got a bunch of companies that end up going under, you're probably going to go under too. Because we're measured on internal rate of return. We're compensated on internal rate of return. And we're compensated on strategic value. So did we achieve the things that we set out to in our company business agreements or commercial agreements with the portfolio companies? If we miss on any of those three vectors, we pay for it. We get ranked and rated based upon our IRR and based upon the strategic impact of the deals that we do. So yeah, there definitely is an implication. It doesn't mean you don't make mistakes here and there. And I've had my sheer kind of dies that home mistake question earlier. I guess a couple of mistakes would just be, you know, a couple of bad deals that I did early in my career. You're kind of really eager and jealous and you want to close an investment and that close a couple of crappy deals, no doubt. And so those went belly up. But you develop skills, know how, experience, and you know, you don't make those same mistakes going forward. But there definitely is a consequence. Well, let me just build on that because we know that the ratios of successes and VC firms are actually not very high. How does Intel capital compare to that? I mean, do you find that there's a higher success rate because you're really focused on the sort of deals you do and your level of expertise or the stage in which you invest or is it really equivalent to other VC firms? Well, the industry for VC is typically 25% IRR, 3X return on investment. That's the typical profile what you look for. We would be aligned with that method. We're as interested in the strategic return. So, you know, there are some instances where we do a deal like Clearwire which hasn't produced the financial return that we would have liked or expected. But we still view that as a strategic success story. So a little different in that regard. But, you know, again, 25% 3X is pretty much what we manage ourselves to. And we have to deliver on that consistently. What's the ratio between how important financial success versus strategic success? I mean, if something's a big strategic success, but a financial bust is that still considered a big success? I mean, I'm curious how you wait the two. Yeah. Well, we are a PNL. So we are accountable for producing profits with our operating business. So you don't want a bunch of those great strategic deals that turn out to be financial busts. So you know, we're thinking about that as we're evaluating, which is why we're again comped and ranked on our financial performance. But there probably is more leeway for us than there would be a traditional venture firm because we have the strategic component. More consideration, less reprimand, perhaps, if it turns out to be a great strategic deal, and though it didn't produce the 3 to 5X kind of return. Cool. Do you consider Intel and investment less riskier compared to other VCs? Considering the fact that your investments are not too much of a diagnostic, first of all, and then you have great amount of insight information before probably investing on those potential strategic partners or vendors or, you know, this is based on the needs of your business, trying to invest in that you're making. Do you consider that riskier at the amount of work on the staff Intel and just see your quality? Right. Less risky. I don't know. I mean, I think it's... This some degree it is, mostly because we have so many resources that we can bring to bear to help the company. And obviously, if we're investing in later-stage companies, they're going to be less risky inherently. So, there are a lot of VCs that focus on growth equity or private equity stage companies. But we bring so much to bear, you know, in the company building, strategic, these commercial agreements, and these are all revenue generating opportunities for the companies. So, I think we do mitigate some of that risk because we have Intel Corporation behind it, and not just Intel, but our ecosystem of partners and fellow travelers. But that said, venture is still a pretty risky business, and you can mitigate some of the risks by having a lot of resources that you can put on the companies, but you're not going to mitigate all of it. And every deal that we do, we're at risk of losing that capital unless one, the market tier lies, the team executes, and we're able to do our part on the commercial side. And in some cases, that doesn't happen. So, I guess it's less risky to some degree to answer your question directly, but it's venture. And venture capital is just that. And venture, and you could win, or you could lose really badly. Great. So, on that note, I'm going to call it a great question. What should we have over? I wanted to make sure for those people to leave that they can leave. But, let's, Ryan, give a question. Sure. I just had a question. How do you follow up a little bit more on the work like balance and being a woman in a very male dominated software high tech industry? Yeah. I still haven't figured it out. To be honest with you. I work a lot. I have an understanding husband, and we have an children for that reason, actually. I'm pregnant, so we are about to have a child breaking the news here. Congratulations. But I'm also 40. And, you know, those are, again, trade-offs. As a woman, you really need to understand what your priorities are, because, I'm sorry, guys. But for women, you should be thinking about kids and whether you want them and your 20s and your 30s, and that when you're my age. But if you have those priorities, you can lay them out, and really hold yourself accountable to them, it's manageable. It's just what happens is you get so caught up in whatever it is that you're doing. I mean, if you really like to work, I'm very work-oriented. So I kind of aired on the side of planning more about my career, rather than planning my personal life or planning my married life, whether I want to have a family. And I'm saying, you need to think about those things very early on. Just understand what you really care about and what are your priorities, and then make sure you allocate some time to the things that you care about. For me, it was just work. It was work and athletics. I was an athlete, college athlete, and so I always stayed in shape, and I always worked a lot. And those other areas, you know, really were neglected. If you don't want that to happen, then identify the top three to five things that are really, really important to you and make sure, at an early age, you start acknowledging all of those areas by spending time developing all of those areas. Because I can tell you, you all are standing for students, you're all very type A, perhaps, and you know, very eager to achieve and want to succeed. Your propensity for that will drive you toward a career at the neglect of some of these other things. And you know, when you're 40 and you realize you don't have a family and you don't have a social life, it really hurts. There's not a lot you can do about it because you're a vice president of the company and there's not a lot of options for you. So just think about it early, plan it, prioritize, and give time and attention to those things. Thank you so much for sharing that and congratulations. Thank you.
