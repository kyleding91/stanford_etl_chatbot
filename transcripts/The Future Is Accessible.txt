 Who you are defines how you build. This is the Auditorial Thought Leader's series. Brought to you by Stanford E Corner. On this episode, we're joined by Srin Madapali, product manager at Airbnb and co-founder of Accomable, a web app that listed accessible combinations in 60 countries around the world. In 2017, Accomable was acquired by Airbnb and Srin has overseen the addition of 21 new accessibility features for the platform. Here's Srin. Well, hi everyone. Thank you so, so much for having me over today and giving me the chance to share my story and background and the work that I've done today in order to help people with disabilities using tech. So today, I just want to give a bit of a whistle stop tour of the story behind Accomable and how we ended up at Airbnb. But also hopefully leave you with some take-home messages about how investing in accessibility can be really valuable from both just in terms of inclusion but also as a business opportunity and give you something to think about as hopefully one day you'll end up building products yourself. So as mentioned, my name is Srin. I share this photo for two reasons. One to prove that I once had hair and good looks. The second reason is this photo was taken about a week before I was diagnosed with a condition called spinal muscular atrophy. So it's a neuromuscular condition that means I don't really have much movement in my arms and legs. Since I can remember, I have used a wheelchair from ability. I have a team of carers and nurses that support me around the clock and I've sort of used assistive technology since day one. I think I learned to type on a computer or use voice activation before I even knew how to hold a pen. So for me, technology, not just on the business side, has had sort of a transformational impact to allow me to live my life since day one. And as you can see today, I'm sitting in a pretty high tech powered wheelchair that allows me to get around and do whatever I want to do. As I said in the introduction, as you can tell from my accent, I am not from here. I am from London and this is the cheesiest photo of London that I could find on the internet. And so yes, I was born and brought up in London and moved to San Francisco a couple of years ago. As mentioned, I'm from London. I originally trained to be in a journey and I practiced law for nearly five years. So I was an M&A guy and had the most amazing time, learned to ton, but was just not really something that I felt resonated with me in the long term. I've always enjoyed building things and just making things and trying stuff out. And just the life inside a law firm at the time was just not for me. And so up until about 2011, I'd never really traveled. I'd only ever gone on those vacations that parents forced you to go on to meet relatives that you don't really want to visit. And like I'd always wanted to go on more exciting adventures. All of my friends had gone traveling and I've seen so many cool places and so many times they would share those experiences. And I'd be like, oh, I wish I could do that. And because I'd never really done anything. And so I took those six months off to see whether it was possible. So with one of my, sorry, two of my care assistants booked a bunch of trips not really knowing what to expect. I had the most amazing time. It was an experience where I went all around Europe, went to many parts of the US, went on a camping safari in South Africa and learned to scuba dive in Bali as you can see from the photo. And this was from an adapted diving center in Bali wherever I turned up to a big flight of steps and I asked, well, how is this adapted? And there were six guys saying that we will help you. And not exactly quite adapted, but it was an amazing experience. However things didn't always go to plan. So lots of times I would use well-known travel websites and things that were supposedly accessible clearly weren't. So this is actually not a photo from that trip, but just goes to show you what people with disabilities often have to face when traveling. So this is actually a registered, listed ADA accessible room at a major hotel chain. Clearly as you can see, it is not possible to use this hotel room. The width between the bed and the furniture is far too narrow. I simply couldn't use it. And this actually was about 11.30 at night when I arrived. And then I had to find other accommodation in the middle of the night just after coming off 11 hour flight from London to the Bay area. And actually on that trip I remember another experience. I, a place that I had booked. The prop tioner claimed to not have steps at the, at the home turned up to see three steps. And I asked the prop tioner, why did you say it had three steps? The prop tioner said, well, it does have, well, it's step three, but you have to get past the first three steps. And so, these are the kinds of challenges and barriers that people faced when traveling with a disability. And so fast forward about three years. So I went back to school again. As mentioned, I did an MBA at Oxford. And on the program I was very fortunate enough to get to know some engineers. And I always thought, I'm too old to learn to code. And this is it. Very grateful. Some of these people said that's absolutely nonsense. And started to help me learn to code. So by the time, fast forward two years later, I'd learnt quite a lot of Ruby on Rails programming. I had done a load of online courses. And a lot of times just taught myself. Where by the time I graduated, I was starting off as a, as basically working as a freelance web developer, making basic web apps for, for whoever needed anything. And I just rolled off a really big project. And also on the side with my friend Martin here, this is from, from our trip into the 2011, 2000, yeah, around then, in California. We thought to ourselves, could we build something interesting and cool that could help people with disabilities travel. So Martin and I went back a long way, childhood friends who both love to travel. And we had a bunch of side projects where we were running a lifestyle magazine just to share information and advice on accessible travel. And so in the summer of 2015, I effectively just locked myself in my bedroom for about 20 days and hacked together a very basic prototype of what became a comable. Now I don't know whether it shows very well on the projector screen, but there were two unique things about what we built. So the first was that we had lots of different filters. So normally a website may have just had a box called wheelchair accessible. We took that box out and actually had lots of different things. It could be grab rails, rolling showers, medical equipment, loads of different things that people could search for and that we had verified was accurate. The second thing I think we also used to joke about was we had more toilets on the website than any other website out there. And sort of joking aside, like it's something really important to see really good bathroom pictures when you are traveling with accessibility needs. The bathroom is so important and it's so vital for your own dignity to be able to use it. And so we were meticulous in collecting photography and making sure that if somebody said they had those things, you could see on the photo whether it was there or not. So as you can see from that photo, it was one of our first listings in Barcelona. The shower is perfectly rolling. The grab rails are solid and there is space under the sink. And so I shared this product just on social media just to see what people would think. And I think just wanted to reiterate, this actually wasn't a business at the time. It was just a fun project with a couple of friends just to see whether we could help friends, our community, our family find somewhere good to stay when going on vacation. And I've always been sort of inspired by sort of the approach of like when you're building something to be as hands on as possible and to do everything as manually as possible at the beginning to kind of learn from your users. So after building the prototype and seeing that we were getting some initial traction, I effectively sort of went on the road so I had an absolute superhero of a support worker, care assistant. Me and him basically did about three and a half, four thousand miles around Europe for three months. And we would source recommendations on social media and I would just contact that person and say, hey, look, would it be possible to stay with you? I would go there and sort of build the product around your user. And effectively, every time I would stay there, I would ask for feedback, iterate the product again. And I come very much from sort of like a rapid prototyping background where you're constantly looking to improve the product, push code out again. And actually this is a photo of me staying at one of the listings we had in sort of the Catalan region of Spain that they, the website, broke down. So I literally had to push a fix on the edge of a mountain. And so we pushed this site out and lo and behold, we actually had some people using it, which was like the most incredible experience ever. And our first customer was Suzanne from Belfast in Northern Ireland, which is a part of the UK. And she'd gone on her first ever trip to Barcelona. And since this no afterwards saying that a comable allowed me to experience my first girls holiday with my best friends. And then she sort of added a note onto that, saying that this was like the first steps to independence. And it was just really great for like, we had enabled her to travel for the first time. And so we were like, OK, awesome. What do we do now? We've got a business on our hands. So what started then was probably like two of the craziest rollercoaster years ever. When we realized that there was a nucleus of an idea here and that this could grow, we raised the load of money from venture capital investors in London and grew to a eight person team. Over the course of that two years, we got over 2000 listings with properties in just over 60 countries. And things were growing really fast and really well. But the problem we had was that we had way too much demand and not enough supply. So it just sort of provides some context for every 10 booking requests that we were getting. We could only satisfy one of them at a time. And some of our property owners were taking bookings two years in advance. That was the level of like demand and the need that this community had and what a shortage of supply there was. And also at the time, you know, many engineers in the room and I'm sure that you've come across this when trying to build things just as as products start to grow, they start to break. And so we were getting a lot of users on the site and trying to build infrastructure to support that growth was beginning to be a really big challenge for us. And we were needing a lot more resource in order to scale much further. So early on in 2017, we started a series a funding round. So this is a funding round just after seed stage where you usually look to raise sort of between two and three million in order to take sort of initial kind of a product that has early product market fit to scale it to a much larger area. And for us as well, we were very driven and passionate about taking the solution that we had sort of prototyped and being able to take it to a much global audience. And I think, you know, from the get go, we started this because we wanted to help people and wanted to solve this problem for people with disabilities so they could travel everywhere. So we would ask this question to ourselves, how do we take this to a much more global level? So we started this funding round and very early on, some of my advisors and investors said, hey, why don't you talk to the big travel platforms and see whether, you know, there could be some tie up or whether the infrastructure you need could be sourced from a big player like Airbnb, for instance. And so one of my investors made an introduction to somebody at senior at Airbnb. I came out here in the summer of 2017 and started a whole series of conversations with a completely open mind. We had no, you know, we didn't really have a goal as to what any kind of partnership or collaboration could be, but very quickly the conversation moved towards on the Airbnb side. Actually, if we want to take this solution and be able to scale it to a global audience, the best thing would be to acquire a Commable and my team to work at Airbnb. And so in November 2017, we closed the acquisition. So a Commable was acquired by Airbnb with very much the mindset that we would infuse accessibility within Airbnb on a much global level. And I would move from London to San Francisco to build out this new team and group. So I was the only one from my team that moved to San Francisco. The rest are still in London working on other parts of accessibility at Airbnb. So I just want to take a step back. So we moved over, so I'd moved over from London to San Francisco. So just here now, I want to take the time to think about why this area is actually really important and why I think many sort of future entrepreneurs in this room today, it's something really valuable to think about. So firstly, it's a well-reported statistic from the World Health Organization that a billion people in the world have a disability of some kind. Now there's many different types of disabilities across a broad spectrum, but I think if we just sort of hold on there and think about that statistic, that is a huge number of people and often an massively untapped audience that many companies, organizations don't often think about. Now for those of you who have worked in accessibility before on sort of the tech side, I'd ask sort of what comes to mind when you think about tech and accessibility. And I imagine a lot of it is things like digital accessibility compliance and does it comply with sort of W3C standards and is it double A or lots of kind of well-established and very vital compliance and accessibility measures to make sure that a website is digitally accessible. However, as the online and offline worlds are converging, we need to think about how accessibility can be baked when technology is facilitating the use of a real world product. So I have some examples here, whether it be a self-driving car or an Alexa eco-device or home automation or even on demand transport like Uber, how are all these products and services going to be usable for people with disabilities when maybe even the foundational fundamental product itself may not have been built for accessibility in mind. But when those products and services are becoming so vital and important, how do we make sure people can actually use them. And for me, to the anecdote I share, even though things are much better now, when I first moved from London to San Francisco, one of my biggest struggles was the fact there was no transportation. So at the time Uber and Lyft did not provide any accessible vehicles as part of their service and so it was literally impossible to get a taxi of any kind around San Francisco. Luckily now, fortunately, things have changed and there is a lot more service. So when I first got to San Francisco, I felt completely stranded because I couldn't use the same transport services that everybody else could use. And so that poses the question, when offline and online converge, how do we ensure accessibility? And I think it's a really important but also a very complex question that sits at the intersection of technology, policy, product development, design, and has a lot of really complex societal questions that we collectively need to think about. And so coming back to what we were doing at a Commable and now Airbnb. So when I started in November 2017, we often say it started sort of the new beginning sort of in the world of accessibility, where we launched something called the In Home Accessibility Team. Now from the outset, I need to add one sort of caveat where the work that my team does is focus very much on how do we facilitate the real-world product to be usable on Airbnb. And the second caveat is we had to start and focus on something. So for the first 18 months, our focus has been very much on physical mobility and how do we ensure that travel is accessible from that perspective, but with a view to one day making sure that actually other people with other types of disabilities can use the product just like anybody else. So firstly, a new team, and this is just a photo of the team. We are a team full of engineers, designers, data scientists, operations people, the entire spectrum of just over 20 people. And for those of you who don't know, so Airbnb has a big mission statement with a mission to create a world where anyone can belong anywhere. And our sort of submissive within that team is that we need to make sure that that ability to belong anywhere includes people with disabilities. And so our team's vision is to create the most trusted travel platform for guests with accessibility needs. So how do we reach this vision? So firstly, we don't just think about accommodation, even though our focus is just on accommodation now. We often chart out the entire process of travel, whether it be like what to look for, how to plan for it, where to find accommodation, things to do, what services, and see is a very holistic thing. We also see it very much as a big, multi-year project where we have to work with lots of stakeholders and lots of parts of the world in order to make this better. And so when I started, I posed three complex questions, and even to this date, we're still working on answering them. So number one, how do you accurately collect accessibility information across millions of listings across the world? Now there's no one definition for accessibility. Many counties, many cities, many countries all have their own definition of what is accessibility. And actually, again, we joking our team. Sometimes some of our biggest philosophical questions are trying to define what is a step or what should we define a step to be. Is it a quarter inch? Is it a half inch? What if it's half inch with a slightly rounded edge? And so we go around in circles trying to define these standards because no one's ever done it before. And again, in various countries of the world where accessibility has not been considered, how do we think about educating and how communicating that information to host around the world in order to add that information? Question two, as you know, sort of Airbnb, the bulk of Airbnb's people sharing private homes that can be booked. And the question then comes, how do you find listings that have higher levels of accessibility information when many homes around the world are not built with those sorts of standards in mind? And finally, when you have a large platform of hosts around the world, how do you make them more aware of accessibility in the first place? So I'm going to give you a quick sort of whistle stop tour of some of the products and services that we're trying to build in our team. So first we've even started that. And I, one of my big take-home messages today is whatever you are building, whether it would be accessibility related or any kind of problem for people, you start with empathy and try to understand people. So we've regularly run focus groups and research with the local disability community. Whenever we are testing products, we make sure that those products are tested and we're getting feedback. We're making sure that many people in our team and across the research function are having that exposure and like learning first hand from people, the experience of traveling. And actually that first hand experience is really vital when you are building product. Secondly, I spend a lot of my time engaging disability communities around the world. So this is a photo of an open house that we did in Los Angeles, where effectively, we had decent amounts of food and drink and had an open invite to the local disability community just to come here about our work and where I could be really transparent about the challenges that we face and be what our bigger picture and road map is. Just to get the community really excited about what we're trying to do and feel like they're part of the journey as well. And so a lot of that research and that empathy and that direct contact of people allowed us to build a road map of what we can actually build. And so again, first thing we did when we got there, there was this one wheelchair accessible tick box that is very difficult to understand. So we took that out and replaced it with all the different filters that we once had many of which we had a comable but were adapted for Airbnb. So again, things like rolling showers, grab rails, all the different features that were once on a comable, these were sort of adapted to be within Airbnb. Now with Airbnb hosts create listings and they can add photos in order to prove things. So one of the things that we did when we first started was in order for people to be able to understand what they could select, we made it mandatory to add a photo. So if you say that you have a grab rail or a rolling shower, you can only tick the box by adding a photo. And so this is just some screenshots of how it looks now for hosts where they get some in-product education. They have to add photos and we provide some training about what exactly they need to do. And again, this was a really good example of its a complex engineering challenge to rebuild a lot of photography uploading systems but also making sure that we can do this without users in mind, that they can do this also with an ability to understand what accessibility is if you're a host. Again as a legacy system, Airbnb had a lot of accessibility information where there was not photography. So we ran a retros or we are running a retrospective exercise where we are asking hosts to add photos or have accessibility information deselected from their listing. And while that might sound pretty kind of acute and harsh, sort of our belief is we want to have a really good service where even if there are less listings, we'd rather have them really accurate with really good photography. So again this is just a little, a few screenshots of what hosts see now when they are asked to add photos or face information being deselected from the listing. And again that's been a great prompt to make sure that photography is there. Before a lot of accessibility information on the listing was pretty hidden and not very easily discoverable, we bumped that to the top when it's now much easier to find. And also we did a whole load of engineering work where if somebody does stay at a listing and we know that they've searched using the accessibility filters, they will get a follow up review question afterwards asking about their stay and whether all the accessibility features that they thought were in the listing, whether they were actually there or not. And again it's just been really popular with guests to be able to have that review flow tailor to them. And then finally as mentioned, we're asking hosts to add photographs to their listing. And we're still thinking a lot about how do we make sure even those photographs are as good as possible. So one of my most favorite projects this year is where we've actually partnered with disability community groups in the Bay Area and we've been working with their membership in a pilot program where we've been paying them to review photos on listings for us in order to give feedback to the hosts. So this was a short two month pilot that we ran earlier in the year. But it was really popular and again we got great feedback from people with the lived experience because they know what they need as somebody with accessibility needs and we're able to provide really good feedback on photography. And so again this is just a screenshot of it. It's a very basic tool where an evaluator would be shown a photo that hosts would have said, you know, we think this is step free. Does it have these? We think it has these things. And then the evaluator would just go through a checklist to see whether the photo had all of these different items in that photo and if not to be able to provide feedback. And then the other big track of work again is not just about technology, even though I'm guessing everybody in the room today cares about engineering and product. We look at it as just a start. Like no matter how good a product you engineer, there has to be that educational layer on top in order to empower the people that you're building products for. So we have a network of photographers around the world and so we've been training those photographers on how to take better pictures of listings should they have accessibility. And I think the best it's showcased I think really evidently in the next slide where again it's a before and after. So the photo on the left, you could not tell much about that shower. After some training and some education, that photo is so much easier to tell that it's so much easier to tell on that photo that that shower has a shower chair. There's a solid grab rail there and it's step free to enter. And again, simple educational interventions that have provided a transformation experience on that listing that somebody can now see it and book it just like anybody else. Again another simple example, the photo on the left doesn't tell you much, but after some training, the photo on the right is so much more evident to see that this listing is so much more usable. And then find like if you're interested, we've been housing a lot of the work that we've been doing on a simple website, Airbnb.com forward slash accessibility as part of our program just to be really transparent about where we're at and what we would like to do. And then on the subject of sort of education, so this year I feel like I've spent most of the time sort of on a plane. We have run over 20 workshops with host real life workshops around the world where again, we bring in local folks with disabilities to share their travel experiences. We ask our top performing hosts in the area to listen to a short talk about accessibility, why it's important and how they can create a great experience for guests and the importance of making sure that whatever they have in their listing is communicated really clearly. And so again, just a chart of where we've had some workshops this year, I have went to a lot of different places and I've been able to run workshops in Europe, America and in Asia. And it's just been a really exciting experience just to be able to evangelize the work that we're doing to a global audience. And again, like coming back to sort of the real world aspect, Nomad, I sort of how important the tech is, it is about real people and being able to improve people's lives. And this was a quote that a host sent to us after coming to one of our training sessions. They updated their listing with accessibility information. A guest tried to book that listing, albeit was not able to make the booking because calendars didn't align, but found the information on that listing really helpful. And sent the host a note just thanking them profusely about how having this information made their life and product experience so much better. And this actually wasn't a technological thing. This was simply being mindful about how we communicate, how we educate people in order to create a better experience alongside having that technological product there as well. And so as much as we're doing this at Airbnb and making a really concerted and intentional investment to improve things, I really do think there are some other cool things that other companies are doing as well. And again, it involves about sort of trying to bridge the offline and online experience. So I don't know how this is actually performed in the big picture, but Tom Yilfiger now have an adaptive line of clothing where they have clothing ranges that are more easier to use if you are a wheelchair user or if you've had a prosthetic limb. And they've just really thought about how they can modify clothing to make it easier if you have an accessibility need. About 18 months ago, I think Google launched a new service on Google Maps where they were adding accessible navigation routes on Google Maps. This was a really great example of an intervention where it had nothing to do with the accessibility of Google Maps itself, but they were using their technology to find real world information so you could discover it on Google Maps. And here is the Xbox Adaptive Controller that Microsoft created again a couple of years ago. This was a controller made to make the Xbox easier to use for folks who have accessibility needs. I thought this was a really cool example of a company making an investment to make their product or service easier to use. And an adaptive controller, it wasn't just for one type of disability, I think there's lots of different kinds of disabilities that this controller considers when it's being used in real life. So again, it's an example of where even the Microsoft game or whatever the product was may have hit compliance on an accessibility standard. Here Microsoft have made the investment to make sure that the controller allows somebody with a disability to use it. And just a great example of converging technology with the real life experience. Here are just some sort of some take-home messages that I'd love to leave with you all today. That has hopefully covered in some of these slides. Firstly, as mentioned, start with empathy and speak to users with disabilities. Make sure you test what you build, iterate and make sure you're testing with that audience to get that feedback. One thing that a lot of companies and organizations struggle with is that they often think about accessibility many years down the line. The earlier that it is done, the easier it is to fix problems. The more scale you have, the harder it gets to retrofit solutions. And it's not just accessibility. I think it goes to so many other problems that society is facing. The longer that they are dealt with, the bigger they get. So the earlier you can address some of these things in my view, the better. Something that I'm really passionate about is actually doing what we can to hire people with disabilities. It's a massively underserved and under tapped in community of talent and resource. And where possible, there's so many amazing and talented people looking for roles. And I think not just on the accessibility front, it also then gives you fantastic insights and lived experience on developing products. And finally, as much as investing in this area is the right thing to do, I also hope people see this as like an amazing opportunity from a business perspective as well. That this is an underserved need. And the best entrepreneurial opportunities often come from needs that are underserved. And so if you are thinking for entrepreneurial ideas, to think of this community as something where you could build solutions for. And on that note, thank you from sort of me and my team. That's my email address on Twitter handle. Welcome any questions that would be today or anytime ever. I'm loving out to help people build things whenever I can. So feel free to reach out to me. And thank you. I think we have some time for questions if anyone has any. So you skipped over the acquisition of your company. Can you talk about the experience going from a founder to being an employee? Sure. It is an interesting experience. It's something, again, like there are some benefits and some drawbacks. When you are a smaller company, there is a very different process to building things, but when you are in a larger company, yet you have to collaborate across many different teams and things have a lot more process for good reason. So that was very much a massive learning curve for me to get used to. But like with anything, it's a different stage of the life cycle of our product. And there's been a great learning experience for me to be able to work on product where you do have sort of Airbnb size scale. I think there's also just on a very human level. You go from working with a team where we can all fit around the same table. And now you're in a big building with thousands and thousands of people. Yeah, it's a very awe-inspiring experience where you feel part of something much bigger. And that was, as mentioned a bit earlier in the talk, what drove us to do this was that we could get that excitement that we can actually be part of something bigger and take what we were doing to a much more global audience. Thank you for the talk. I was wondering about any really human challenges that tested your vision and sort of your growth and sort of your path because you spoke to a lot of awesome steps. But just curious more about some really big, personally testing and vision testing challenges. They came on early stage. So the question, so thank you for the question. Here's where there were any sort of challenges to our bigger vision. Did I understand the question correctly? There were a couple of things. So on one level at the very beginning, I did think a lot about, you know, when you create a website like this for people with disabilities, is it the right thing that this is like a separate website? So, you know, I've always been a great believer in sort of integration and mainstreaming things. And I did it in the early days, think a lot about whether, you know, are we doing the right thing, building a standalone platform in itself? I think in hindsight, it was a great way to prove the concept and to prove some fundamental hypotheses, but that yes, it is better to do this as part of a wider organization. In terms of other challenges to the vision, I'd say there were more just unlike the operational level, again, often things just didn't work to plan whether it'd be like bits on the website breaking down or whether, you know, you're dealing with challenges of like, of onboarding new hosts and getting information, the right information from them. So I think it's less about the vision. The main stumbling box actually become more in execution and just trying to sort of overcome all of these daily challenges of building a product where you don't really have much funding. Everyone is stretched. Yeah, you feel like you're never more than a day from, you know, running out of money or some big disaster on the horizon. But at the same time, trying to sort of grow and scale something that is, you know, effectively still very fragile. So I'd say in the challenges and obstacles are more on that front rather than on sort of challenges to the bigger vision. So there's a question at the front. So you talked a lot about the different sort of compliance and actually making things usable. Do you think that sort of the rules that you're complying to need to be changed or does it more need to come from other people like taking things for it? So the question is, so I mentioned earlier, a lot about going beyond compliance and making products usable. And the question is about sort of, is it how we can best do that? And so how we can take that further to understand the question correctly. So I definitely think that's been a major challenge and I do think like rules and a lot of the basic kind of guidance in place doesn't need to be developed. I think a lot of rules were, and a lot of guidance notes were created in an era sort of before the internet. And I do think when you are having things like the sharing economy or like sort of the tech and real world sort of merging together, I do think at a societal level, yes, we do need to have a rethink about what new standards could be. Also many rules and guidance sort of notes are sort of done very much thinking about the world divided up by sort of national borders. And in a sort of a tech world that you know, it is where you can, I don't know, communicate with somebody in another country or use a product to travel to a different place at the click of a button. I think again, we do need to think about how do we build standards at a more global level that I think will actually make it easier for a lot more organizations and companies to do this. What advice do you have for budding product managers, especially, you know, there's a huge difference between the product managers. So the question here is about sort of as a product manager and backgrounds and sort of what might work best. Like I do think it often depends on the product that you are managing. And it's slightly just to turn the question a little bit. Like I do think those product managers skills are very dependent on what exactly you are building. Like I do think like if the product is very, very deeply technical, naturally having sort of engineering background, I think makes life easier. Whether if it's something less technical and more about kind of user experience and sort of the flows and the onboarding, then I think there are other skills that can become really helpful as well. And I think there's also the matter of like what the life cycle of the product is as well. So I don't think there is a one size fits all answer. I think there's a huge number of variables in this from my own personal perspective. I think having experienced from lots of different areas has helped me a huge amount. Whether it be having sort of that business background that helps me talk to like our operations and sort of business team or actually, you know, having a little bit of technical skill myself has made it much easier to work with engineers and designers. As that, knowing a little bit about a lot of things has personally been really valuable because I think yet that's probably, it's something that I think is very valuable particularly when you're working on something on early stage and you're just having input from lots of different specialists. But again, I think it's one of those questions. Unfortunately, you are sort of 50 different product managers. You probably get 50 different answers. Go away from that. Hi. I really loved the diversity you have in your team in terms of perspectives. I was just curious as you were growing your company, if you want to cover any blind spots that pertain to non-melodicify people in your community. So the question was, did we have, like, as you can see, diversity was really important as we were building our company and now in our own team. Were there any blind spots? Did I understand the question correctly? Yeah, we did. I'm coming up with an interesting spot. Any blind spots. So there were some blind spots. Less blind spots. It was more that things we knew that we could do better, but at the time during the start up, we just didn't have the resources to do. So we were very well aware that there were certain types of disabilities that we were more focused on and that we were kind of optimizing for in terms of building products when actually there's so many other use cases that we felt we could do more for. So less of a blind spot, there were just a lot of aspirational things that we wanted to do better, but just didn't have the resource at the time. And again, it's one of those things where you sort of have to make those trade-offs as a founder, but it's trade-offs, but knowing that those trade-offs are part of a bigger vision where it's still really important and you will just get to it at a slightly later stage. So building products for over looked at the demographics, they make them sometimes a little different and it kind of went to know what your experience was when it comes to getting your first huge champion and so your first student masters when you're building something people they haven't thought about. So the question is sort of what we were thinking about when we were sort of because we were building for an underserved community. So the question was, how did we, what were the champions? The first huge champion. The first huge champion. What was our experience with the first huge champions? So for those who were building for very quickly got what we were trying to do, I think that is the great thing about when you're helping an underserved community. The underserved community will immediately often recognise, okay, this is something we really need. I think for us the bigger challenge was trying to persuade wider society that this is important. Especially in things like fundraising, you're pitching to people who may not have had that person experience or have come across these situations before and I think that for us was the biggest challenge. It was less champions within our community. It was more finding folks who could support us amongst the wider entrepreneurial ecosystem. So in our early days of fundraising, we had a lot of struggles with people thinking that there wasn't a business opportunity here. This is not really a need. This is just something very simple that other companies are going to do. Whereas actually our lead investor had a son with a disability and the minute he saw what we were doing is like, I get it. I know this is really important. So in answer to your question, like champions within our community were pretty easy to come by. I just feel like I wish we had more champions at the time within the wider world. The entrepreneurial thought leader Syrians is a Stanford e-corner, original production.
