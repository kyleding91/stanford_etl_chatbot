 Who you are defines how you build. This is the OddPattern thought leader series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. Today I am absolutely delighted to welcome Sarah Manker and Hans Tong to ETL. First and foremost, Sarah Manker is the founder and CEO of Grow Intelligence. Grow data analytics and forecasting models and form companies involved in the agricultural supply chain and organizations impacted by climate change. Prior to founding Grow, Sarah was in Morgan Stanley's commodities group where she managed and options trading portfolio. She was named a global young leader by the World Economic Forum and is a fellow of the Aspen Institute as well as a trustee of the Mandela Institute for Development Studies. Secondly, super excited to welcome Hans Tong, the managing director or managing partner at GGV Capital, who is focused on early stage investments across the global digital economy. He has consistently recognized amongst top venture capital investors in the world having been named to the 4SMIDIS list nine consecutive years from 2013 to 2021, most recently ranking number three. His portfolio includes 18 companies valued at more than $1 billion. He also oversees GGV's DEI initiatives and he is the co-host of the podcast evolving for the next billion. That explores entrepreneurship in US, China, India, Southeast Asia and Latin America. Hans also became a significant investor in food and add tech, so I'm sure we're going to hear a lot more about why companies like Grow Intelligence have captured his interest. Huge welcome to you both, Sarah and Hans. So let's kick things off by getting a bit of an introduction to Grow Intelligence. Sarah, I'm going to turn it over to you for a brief explainer. Thanks for having us Emily. Great to meet everybody virtually. I'm the founder and CEO of Grow Intelligence and Grow is as a company that I founded in 2014 with the mission of helping solve for real world systems like food security and climate change where they're quite complex and have a lot of inefficiencies. We are an AI company that ingests very large disparate data sets that have anything to do with the global agricultural and climate markets and essentially ingest that data that can come in any format any language. We standardize that data both in terms of format as well as language and then we normalize it through essentially an ontology and a knowledge graph that we've developed that helps to sort of find the dots and connect the dots between sort of all of the components that drive the supply and the environment. Now, when I started grow, the goal was to really do this, you know, for food security and to say, how do we predict the supply and the demand of food for every agricultural product on earth every single day. And when you think about that, that's super challenging because agriculture is made up of tens of thousands of different products. Each one has a set of biological rules that govern how it grows and the supply side is constantly disrupted by climate shocks and weather related shocks oftentimes. And then on the demand side, if you think about it, it sort of boils down to us as individuals and sort of what we consume. And so in sort of modeling this system on a real time basis, we ended up sort of understanding that agriculture was at this very important intersection between sort of our ecology and sort of our global economy. And so in contributing sort of to the agricultural world, we realized that we were also generating data and insights about sort of both our ecological and our economic world. And so we develop millions of different predictive models that are essentially making this data available on a more real time basis. So think up to four months in advance in the US, then when US government releases come out. But if you're looking at places like Russia or China or Brazil, you know, we're one to two years ahead of sort of national estimates and that sort of really harnessing the power of of AI in a way where we really mix it in with deep domain expertise and sort of human intelligence that informs that at the very beginning. That's amazing. You've come so far since I first learned about your organization, but I'm actually curious if we go back even before grow. This is experiences you've had in your childhood, in your sort of early career that continue like the experience I see had that continue to inform your work every day to day. Share a few of those stories with us. Yeah, I mean, I was born and raised in Ethiopia, you know, my family still lives back home. And, you know, growing up in a country at a time when, you know, the headlines were all about famine and starvation and you know, there were all these sort of songs and movements to raise money for the country. And so growing up, you know, very aware of sort of the notion of scarcity and not taking anything for granted, right. And so even after I sort of came to the US on scholarship and I went to Mount Holyoke, I knew that what I wanted to do was work on problems that involved the real world and sort of an impactful way. And so I became a commodities trader really and not sort of join, you know, another part of sort of Morgan Stanley where it was sort of more say high tech finance was actually because commodities are so linked to our national economies and sort of natural resource wealth. I was always sort of, you know, I think curious, but also motivated and driven by trying to understand how markets sort of evolve and how to sort of solve for, you know, deep challenges like food insecurity in not, you know, developed countries, but really developing countries. But it's, you know, I quickly learned it's very complicated first with energy and then I jumped into agriculture, not recognizing it was going to be. It's like way more complicated than what we were doing on the energy side back then. So. It's amazing, amazing. Thank you for sharing. You know, Hans, same for you. Many, many years ago you were an industrial engineering student at Stanford before it was called MSME. I'm curious how you found your way to venture capital of doing what you do today. I mean, there must be some sort of inspirations that you had while you were at school and in your 20s that led to you becoming on the four's minus list. Thank you for having us here. We're the small master in the service company and it's been amazing about the part of her journey and see her do amazing things. Part of the reason being of EC was to work with some of the amazing founders to help them realize your vision. If they're successful, then we're successful. And as a Taiwanese American growing up in Taiwan, it's a small place and you learn that you're part of a larger, difficult system. So you need to be value add to other people around you. And so whereas Sarah learned scarcely is an issue for us in a hard to get helpful. And our value is something that was coming in green in the evening growing up. Then coming to the US when it's 13 growing up in LA and seeing how it is such a different world and how one comes along manufacturing, certain conductors, personal computers. And then always on medium like what is that these two worlds intersect in turns out that being a Stanford, you see how the media business on one hand and and option components on the other hand, eventually are all part of that larger ecosystem. And that's that sort of ecosystem way of thinking kind of let me to pursue a major in industrial area. But I will also very fortunate to be on campus this now for the right times, in 1993, about a cost of the 1.0 become a thing. And then faster today we've got 2.0 in 20 2006 to 2007. Now it was worth 3 in 2020.1. So it's just it's amazing how things have changed the more they've changed that the you've on the right side of history, you're open minded, you try to build system that's open. And more people can help to create value in the network, that kind of ethos and a way of thinking has certainly well mature here and also in your team that need to do BBC as well. Beautiful, beautiful. Well, you know, one of the most pressing challenges of our time, maybe the one in the next 10, 20, 30 years is really climate. Right. And I think both of you recognize that probably before most of us did. So, you know, let's start with let's start with that sort of broader question, your climate issues. Are probably requiring us to think a little differently, work together a little differently, you know, in a cross sector manner, right, public, private, academic, nonprofit, and all of these different entities need to work together and find a path forward. You know, maybe a direct question for you, Sarah, you did you came out of Wall Street as a commodities trader and you you knew that you want to get back to solving for food insecurity. And you had a number, obviously you have lots of options and how you do that. How did you choose to go the route of a VC funded startup. I didn't go down the route of a VC funded startup. I went the route of solving for a problem. I was very passionate about and that solving for that problem led me to sort of understand that what I needed to do is create a company, not a nonprofit, for example, right. There's also that route. So, the first is sort of motivation of starting through a problem that you're genuinely passionate about because then that sort of leads you to sort of the right solution, right. And I think that to me, the first was what made me realize that was just how complex the challenge is going to be and how much funding it would need over time. And also sort of the different interests you'd have to weave if you're solving for something as complex complicated as food security, you're dealing with, you know, farms that are half acres and farms that are 100,000 acres. You're dealing with very small food and beverage companies, you're dealing with mega companies, you're dealing with governments and you're dealing with traders and you're dealing, you know, so you had to deal with sort of a very sort of complex system. And as a business, you can sort of design yourself around how do I solve for that problem. And so, you know, we started by really saying, who are the domain experts that we want to hire as opposed to who are the technologies we're going to hire because the domain experts then said, you know, here's how I think, I mean, when we hired our first environmental scientist, it was because I saw their resume, like, because it came in and I said, oh, I've never worked with satellite imagery before, but like this sounds like something we should do. We should hire this person. And, you know, so that sort of deep domain expertise and forming it and then bringing in sort of world class engineering to scale that sort of human knowledge became the lens by which we sort of took that path. And, you know, I think one of the one of the great things about sort of taking the path of a VC funded startup or, you know, sort of the path of the business is that you innovate and you're super agile and you change your ways as you get more data and information. And you have to be stuck. I always say like you have to always be driven by sort of your mission and your purpose, but the strategy and sort of especially the tactical moves you take from a day to day months to my basis will change while sort of that final end goal always remains the same. And that just I think works really well for the types of investors that we brought on board early, which, you know, I think that's what VCs great at. You know, I think you had a brilliant and very clear narrative for a very long time around closing this global gallery gap, which you explained in big backs and it was so resonant for me and having that be friend and center and it like that's the problem that you're looking to solve. And then finding the most efficient and optimized way to do that makes a lot of sense and it's unique that you started not with a tech but with the domain expertise because ultimately we have to be applicable to the domain experts at the end of the day. So that was super smart move that you did that. You know, let me ask a deeper question. I know that with the domain experts on your team now, you probably have lots of ability to work across many different sectors and all of the different components of the ecosystem. So I'm curious, you know, complex chaotic system that we're working with. This is a wicked problem to close that massive gallery gap that you explain. What sorts of organizations tend to be your direct customers? How do you partner with them? How do you share your products with them? And how do you communicate with other stakeholders in the system who may not necessarily be your direct customers if that exists too? Yeah, that's a very good question. You know, we have a saying at Gro, which is the AI is only as good as the HIV behind it. So you better get your human intelligence right because otherwise you won't build a very smart system. You might build an AI. It just might not be very good. So if you care to solve for it, start with that. And I think this fundamentally an important lesson for AI companies in general, whatever sort of domains we're talking about. And make sure that the team resembles the world you're trying to model, whether it's in the domains that they're from or the languages they speak or the way that their mind operates, right? Like this notion of sort of diversity expands so beyond just like, are you a man or a woman or you black or you not to, are you truly using and, you know, do you have a little microcosm of the world you're modeling sitting in your company? And if you don't, you're going to have other challenges down the line. So be really smart about that, right? And so what that has allowed us to do is think about the supply chain end to end. Think of an agricultural system and I call it the anatomy of agriculture. You have, you have sort of people who feed into the system. So think of that as policymakers. Think of that as seed and fertilizer companies or crop protection companies, etc. So people who are impacting the farmer that that sort of grows that stuff. And we work with them and we work with them on a sort of two levels on sort of the seed and an input company basis is like, what products should you develop? What are people going to want? And for where? Because that's hyper local in terms of what you develop. And from a policy standpoint is, how do you manage for national food security risks? So from strategic reserves management, etc. So food security is national security in sort of most countries. Then you go further down and we don't really work with farmers because farmers hyper optimized to a field. And we optimize to a system. So we really think of sort of the whole world in sort of an interconnected way. But once the farmer grows that product, it needs to go somewhere. So you have logistics companies and you have trading companies that actually traded or processing companies that process that product. And so there's applications there because ultimately they want to know how much was produced and of what type. And so the same models that you've built at the top actually impact sort of the buying side. And then ultimately you have one more layer, which is the companies that brand the goods, right. So a CPG company that creates chocolates or creates your soups or whatever that is because all of those are the ingredients that go into it. And ultimately your retailers that sell it. So essentially we touch everyone across the system except for the farmer and the end buyer like you and I, right. We're not a consumer product and we're not a product for the farmer to optimize like a precision farming type role. But there are many other players in the ecosystem as you rightfully note that you need to get in. You have lots of advocacy organizations. You have lots of universities academic research institutes that generate tons of research that we leverage and scale sometimes right. We're not reinventing the wheel everywhere sometimes we're saying where's some amazing science being done and how do you take that and automated and scale it. And so we like to work both with academic institutions as well as sort of advocacy organizations and recently actually started a program called Grow for Good, which is if you are working on a problem that's going to solve a challenge in sort of a net positive way for society. And you're going to open it up for others to use you can get access to any level of our product for free. So whether it is sort of the you know like swipe your credit card type, you know, put in your credit card information and sort of buy a subscription to a single sort of application and a portal. You know all the way to the level that we engage with some of the large corporates, which is really thinking about, you know, operations across the scale and doing much more enterprise level partnerships where it's deeply strategic in nature. We'll give you access to any of that. And so we really I'm really excited, especially this year about bringing grow for good to life in a much bigger way because I think that if we are going to be sort of a trusted source for the industry, we have to be trusted by everyone, not just some. And you know that's I think a really important principle. That's beautiful. You know, I wanted to go back to something that you said earlier that really struck me and we enforce this notion to get the AI right. You have to get the H.I. right, you know, the human intelligence right and again and again you bring that up. You know, I just super fun of a couple of hours to get today. A go today. I was talking to a chef who said, you know, with all your computer vision work, there's a difference between parsley stems and cilantro stems and I'm like, really they look exactly the same. But apparently he can tell right just by seeing them and you need the domain experts in the room to ground truth and to guide the development of products otherwise we're not going to get right. Hans switching over to you, you know, you saw around the corner pretty early on too and have developed this deep expertise and interest in food tech and ag tech. You've invested in a number of companies in this area, obviously with grow as others and as one of the top BCs in the world, I mean you have an opportunity invests in literally anything. So I mean, what brought you into the space? Why are you so excited about it? How did you find your way to Sarah? You know, tell us more about this. Sure. I'm just emperor. I saw my career in investment banking. So we're Sarah worked at more certainly I was doing M&A on investment banking side at barrel bench on Wall Street. That led me from New York to Hong Kong and then group of friends from IBD since down from Berkeley, one of those international. So as many people I think of today, we start with now Stanford, what draw about Stanford? We were thinking, you know, what can we welcome a bunch of 2526 year old do in web went out up and that's so I ended up doing two startups. So all of them didn't make any money, but learn a lot in that coming back in join BC farm, in starting BC, both here in the US as well as in Asia and the advantage of being having almost all together probably by then. And for three years of banking experience, three years of growth capital investing experience and then four years of start experience, I was more ready to take advantage of opportunities that came out with Web $2. And so most of the investments that 18 unicorns invested really rose out of 2007, because that class up to now. And as something coming up every in the and proleton and Xiaomi and stock export growing. It comes increasingly clear that there are much larger issues that people have tried to tackle in the past that couldn't happen others that up to that point had been successful as solving them is going them to large outcomes. But at some point in time, that's very much needed. Everyone is familiar with the story of Tesla and how they come about and it took a long time for this becomes successful once it did. It became much bigger outcome than even thousands, potentially possible. So I thought that in the world food security would increasingly be a bigger problem. With some BMP or in the world back in 2016, it will get to turn billion in the next 40 years. And given the climate change, it's going to be increasingly harder to grow food efficiently and effectively. And same time food wasteage was becoming a bigger problem as well. A lot of things that we are so into the grocery stores, a lot of them end up being wasted and compared to wires. And so we just knew that it's a much bigger problem than so many machines have solved it. And the question we asked ourselves that we can we find great founders that we can back that can solve this systematically and look less and from before. And a quite a lot of money knowledge, but at the same time, approach it from a sort of tech lens from some of the bill software companies build smart tech companies that know how to scale and know how to create in iterate very quickly and efficiently. So not everything is moving in a month, but not a month of days or weeks. So have that in turn a clock that can fast turn around and iterate, give feedback and innovate again. So I was familiar with that. So the feedback loop in the way of giving things and eventually we were introduced to someone was doing about reforming in New York. Irving was someone who connected several of us and when we invest in battery, evaluation of less than 50 million, today's over two billion in value last four and four and a half years. And so the kind of value they're creating with indoor farming was extremely interesting and having grown up to downs with Irving, it was very easy for us to ask, who else do you know in New York or other places that you have come in contact with solving interesting problem with a very promising team that is to Sarah up and growing. So a lot of things what we do is look for founders who are doing amazing work and then that person's network will lead us to other promising founders who are thinking like have similar kind of approach to solving problems, even the company with very different backgrounds. And that's what makes jobs so interesting. I'm going to dig into that a little bit because I know you also started and run the DEI program within GGV. Can you comment on that a little bit because you know that having lots of backgrounds benefit, but as you sort of evolved as an investor and doing this within your company, what are some of the lessons you've learned. Right, I think with the Black Lives Matter and then in South Asian, hey, they were in the Me Too movement, they were just conceptually a lot of last five years, a lot more issues that have become a lot more people were aware of them and it's thanks partially to social media gather more momentum than ever. When people realize that many more around the world sufferings suffer from the same issues, does not look what anymore is extremely universal. And so it was a group effort. I can't say I'm the one that heads the program because there's so many people in our company, I'll do it in shifting things. So I'm on our team, Jesse, that leads our ESG efforts with respect to our LPs and help us to figure out what the right organizations will be going to across the world and that's in the US, multiple cities in the US, in Asia, what the countries in Asia, America and so forth. And we also have people that have started a fellowship program to help recruit college students from diversity backgrounds to be in charge at some of the best technology companies in startups is a formality in the hospital. And we also have efforts that work with, that we spent time working with our colleagues, Jeff and Jen spent time with our a raise to help to recruit female directors to join warm and free warm members of interesting tech companies that are ready to scale over the last three years. And I spent time helping the contributing to Asian American foundation, Leva Jerry and Jill's high up Ayurveda Riyahu that's trying to do more for the Asian American community here in the US. It's been time working with Eric, we had zoom in others, we see to raise money for Asian community, Asian American community groups of fighting stop fighting Asian, Asian, Asian, Asian, Asian, and so all that I'm somewhat contributed, but it's not very small part of what overall efforts that's going on all around us. So having a chance to be more aware and making others more aware what's going on has been, has been good, but it's not more than we do. I'm so grateful, you know, it's been quite the last couple of years. I mean, it's very emotional, very, very intense to be part of this and to know that while we don't necessarily have answers yet that everybody is much more aware and doing what we can from where we sit is just really, really hardwarming for me. Let me go back to the topic that a lot of our students are very interested in. So when we started class last week, one of the top movies on Netflix was Don't Look Up. I found that super interesting. I had watched over the holidays as well. And it had the whole entire sort of point of the movie for those of you who have watched, I won't know spoilers, I promise, is it's kind of a parody on society right now and big picture. I'm sure these scientists come and they're like, there's a meteor coming and here are all the numbers and we've done like the analysis backwards and forwards and 25 other scientists have done their analysis as well. Speakers going to hit Earth. And yet the story of the whole Don't Look Up is there's like an entire backlash, a whole type of people were like, there's no media or media coming Earth is going to be fine. So I guess maybe like coming back to the topic at hand, you know, we, we have information, we have data, but people still make bad decisions or people still are unwilling to sort of look at the science or look at the information rationally. So, you know, back to you Sarah, I know that you're able to really bring some incredible intelligence to your customers, you know, the fact that you're able to show, you know, a country like China, like you're too ahead of what policy makers can publish right now, what their numbers look like is incredible. It's incredible, but you know, beyond the data itself, what other, what other things need to be in place for action to result from information. Yeah, I watched the movie and I was like, I don't know whether to laugh or cry here. It's a great film, but you know, it's. It's super ironic. Yeah, it's you know, because it was so I mean, just replace that with climate change and the conversations on change or. The security right and you know, if you go back to the start of COVID and all the supply chain shocks that we had and. We went from a world where I remember you know, we talked to journalists is like every publication had like one dedicated agriculture journalist if that or some and then all of a sudden every journalist became a food journalist because they were. It's like, oh food and agriculture so linked to like our macro economic systems and drives inflationary pressures it does you know all these things and when the breaks happen for a company like ours it wasn't surprising because we fundamentally knew that some of the structures that are broken are sort of around things like lack of trust right I mean knowing that in the you know if you take the fresh produce space contracts are negotiated day to day week to week if you're lucky forget you know years in advance to create. Stability in sort of a shorty of supply and the price at which you're going to get it at and so that was sort of the ultimate you know sort of signal that like hey guys the system is broken and it continues to show us it's broken right I mean global food inflation is at all time highs and it's only getting worse it's not getting better right now right and then on the other side you have climate change and. There's lots of yelling and screaming about that and it's like hey I hope we're not all under water by the time we decide it's time to take action and I think that goes to something which is really around to to I think key aspects to driving change right and across the system right because I think you can drive behaviors of organizations and individuals and organizations very differently then inspiring change across the system which is really what we're talking about here right so. Easy to go motivate a sale in a corporate because you do an ROI analysis say here's here's how much more money you make or here's trader how much better your trading strategy can get as a result of what we do. But you take that back and you go back to sort of the mission aspect it's two things one is trust there's no trust across the systems and trust is broken and to his communication which is. You know scientists produce great science but scientists are maybe not the best communicators so how do we actually and we spend a lot of time at you know doing this at grow which is. Taking deeply scientific knowledge and making it humanly accessible right because the more people sort of understand the more questions get asked but also if people trust you as a source then. It becomes like a basis for starting a conversation maybe it's not the thing that drives the ultimate change but there's a reference point by which people start when the reference point is completely disparate and different and nobody even knows how much. You know stockpile of a particular crop there's in the world to start the conversation around how do I fund that you know how do we how do we exchange it across the system I think trust is not there and and one of the things that's been so important to us as a company is actually building that trust and it's been. Sort of the harder road to building a company because of that because we say you know we started with understanding very individual components very well meaning can we predict the supply of corn in the United States every day and or you know weat in Russia every day to starting to connect the dots between or the demand of you know poor can China and then how do you connect the dots between all those things so it's like. Forecasting individual components to connecting a real world system and being very transparent about it because ultimately. All of those players across the ecosystem need to trust you and so we adopted a few key principles around the way we model things which is if you work with us all our models are available to you so you can get the output but you can get the methodology to. Because you know what that builds one layer of trust to we chose some set of our models and we made them free and publicly accept accessible to everyone regardless of what type of thing you have because again you have to build trust and so we started with the markets that everybody understood like the United States and have now gone to markets where our advanced lead time is 24 months and advance you're not going to wait 24 months to validate of what we told you is is good enough so you're going to say do I trust the rigor the integrity of the data the integrity of the process and sort of the. Their models and so it's about sort of honesty so can we provide you the honest answer which is very different than just the correct answer because the honest answer sometimes is. Actually the confidence interval is very wide and it will only get better over time and so explaining that to non statisticians and business leaders or policy makers is a challenge we confront every single day but I think it's doable but I think it comes down to trust and and and to. To transparency and you know to sort of communication and communicating that correctly. Yeah I am so thrilled that you talked about communication and trust because ultimately persuasion requires it to be. Set in the right way by the right person at the right time right. It's changing minds of somebody or group like requires all those elements and you are really creating the foundation for that to happen. And also doing the really hard work in taking on these additional components to really get the action that we all desire towards a world where the calorie gap is closing as quickly as it possibly can. Let me point over to you Hans you know a lot of what you do to is around synthesizing a ton of data and trying to see the future so you know how do you look at big food and ag and and just. Overall the industry at large I mean food and ag is the largest industry on earth so you know what what are you excited about and where does the data point you for example I don't know if you've used you know Sarah's platform for example to think about your own investment portfolio. Curious your thoughts on that front yeah sure good points are definitely very useful especially for us to a trading up within a financial community so for us. We end up focusing on trends that are a bit more macro on what we think the you know the future evolve. You know they have all the things I'm excited about food food act to keep part of it in general what we see is that thanks to all the innovations that have come because of Covid try to cope with this changing world that's happening so quickly. Our economies in this place a much faster rate that we all thought possible in Asia for example the payment payments what the mobile payments base is so much bigger than it was in the US pre-coded and over the last two years things are tuned dramatically here now paypal and cash app all going to be super app and five years ago they don't want to be folks on just one thing that they're good at and. You see that in tech so much more online excuses happening even with what's happening in China for the right to understand point around the world you see a lot more companies and start up providing services online in digital health. Tell the dog and the bond will merge but there are many more stars come from come public to do that to provide color medicine much better with much better care and matching. We're seeing great resources to make it more available to everyone else around the world so every single segment of the economy looking at you see internet and tech playing a much bigger role than before and so the for us it's it's a figuring out how to prioritize and focus because there's more opportunities and more founders start out to invest in now we have money for. And so apart the things that we have learned about our spectate is that how to scale ourselves so that we can be of help to the founders the first 10 years of the GDGP started to come out in Singapore first 10 years where it's a bit over a billion and the last 10 years the second decade race that just under just under eight and so we scale a part of it internally added the pop from team at the I.R. team and we're going to be able to do that. The power of being as big as marketing as calc and recruiting as funders and leaders network training so we have a lot more services so we can help the founders that we work with so all now. And think about how to scale and and how we do that you know the fashion so we learn to input funders from our happy's and evolve ourselves. And so it's a very important thing that has been amazing learning experience for us even as we we we do it and getting back to your previous question about so don't look up and it's a fascinating the first half of the movie is about how to convince people in the second half of movies that we identify a real problem how do we actually go about solving it and that's a whole set of influence you have to even predict sir you're not right method to solve that and it's it's so such a pretty much what we see in the summer role. This is thestart as we did again the worst for this experience that has more power of interest is because everyone of you have the ability to fast it all up and it's a good thing definitely you're right effort, but it's invented a natural language and really effort. That's what happens, we're more hare even if everything else is not perfect. So how do they go with judgment calls a lot? That's the right thing to focus on and get everyone to the company to solve it. And even if you don't know what's the right way of solving it, you go through a process to quickly living a way and then that method doesn't work and pick up one at this work. It is sometimes luck. Sometimes it's just having that intuition about what to do. Some of it just may be, but finally, test everything and we'll find it. Then that is the, you know, $1 question. And that's for somebody who's a unicorn. It goes significantly bigger and bigger and many sometimes are still learning that. And that's okay. And the bottom board I will preach is having that empathy of what we're trying to help insert and then be able to work methodically until you can get a right. But all about trying to add value, create value, deal equal system, and over time even we're gonna get in the first two, three, four, twice. Over time, we'd be much closer to a goal that helps. That's beautiful. I'm almost bursting with like the spoilers of what happens in the movie because ultimately, it was a little, I mean, it kind of, yeah, like you can't just solve it with one solution, right? This requires many different people, many different solutions and iterating would have been very good like for that. We didn't see a second third or four try already testing whatsoever. So, we have about 15 minutes left and I wanna open it up for Q&A with the students. So, Hans, you have invested in numerous successful companies. What stood out to you the most among those companies that made you wanna invest in them? Do you have any advice for student founders looking for investment? That's two separate questions for first part. Someone like Asera or Erving, smart, kind of successful career, yet have a big vision or a pain point that they really wanna solve. And Q&A on the way to write experiences, compact, and team to do that, talk about as a team and they wouldn't quickly iterate. Some of this won't work, that's fine. No race, let's keep on figuring out whether the other way so we can try to make that work. Usually the best ones who back are like to learn most efficiently and then have a leadership ability to join them, they make that work, and then be extremely systematic and clear in their thinking to try different alternatives until we get the right answer. There's no way something that we just come up with one idea and one approach solid, it works really, it doesn't exist. So, figuring out how to solve that systematically and be able to build a team that can rally and help each other make the best group decision together is not easy, but the ones that can crack that and set the new ones that do well. And when we meet the founders, those are kind of qualities we look for. And if we have anything about the problem that trying to solve, then it's a meaning of the minds on that specific industry and a specific problem and the right approach that could eventually solve it. And if we have spent time on a sector and they're following up a lot more than we do, then it's a lot easier towards feel comfortable that they know what they're doing. Even so early, we're willing to take a bat from this team. Awesome. I am going to ask this question anyways, but I think you've answered most of it lots of votes here. So, what is the most important thing students should prioritize to succeed in the current atmosphere? Is it networking? Is it technical skills? Is it communication? Actually, I'd be curious to hear both, you know, Hans and Sarah, like Hans, as you're thinking about investing in founders or Sarah as you're looking in hiring, like, what are you looking for? I'll let Sarah start first. Passion. Because, you know, in the end, success as an entrepreneur, success in your career, going into any career at a young age, right? And building a company is a career. It's just, it's a different career path than sort of getting hired into a company and joining an early stage company. You need passion because that job and what you're doing requires a lot of persistence. And it's very hard to be persistent about something you don't care about. And so, don't go sort of with the trend, right? And I think this question of in today's market, that's the danger in the question. I would take that off and say, what does it take to succeed in life? Because then you'll succeed in this market and you'll succeed in the market that comes after this because it's gonna look very different than sort of the last couple of years, right? And so, this notion of how do I build resilience and how do I persist through something, the ups and the downs, you know, I think is so important. And I remember when I quit my job at Morgan Stanley to start grow and back then it was not called that, it was just a hunch that I needed to do something different. My boss tried to give me an argument as to why I should stand. He was like, just stay so you get a little more experience doing X, Y, Z, like move maybe from an expand your portfolio, like expand from just trading to some of the structuring and the work around sort of the external client facing stuff so that you get the full life cycle. So just stay a couple more years and then I think you'll be right the right time. And I was like, no, I think I should just go and risk it all and if it works, if it doesn't, I'll get another job. Like it didn't feel so existential because I was so passionate about what I was doing. But the one thing that actually the trading job prepared me for in a way that he never even anticipated and I didn't, but having lived this journey now sort of fully appreciate is the volatile nature of the entrepreneurial journey is not sort of living off the highs and not getting too down when you're in the lows. And so trading is similar because you make money some day and you use money some day and you, or months on end and sort of knowing how to sort of balance yourself so that you survive that volatility was literally I think having done that as a trader when I started the company and I was getting knocked around at times, it was like, oh, this is like a bad trading. Okay. Not, you know. And so, but I do think it requires passion to get persistence and sort of thinking beyond the current market to just yourselves in your lives or like your students now. Like you have the whole world to explore so don't try to comport yourself too early to try and fit into something in a world that is constantly changing and evolving like create your own world. And I know that sort of my thing. Yeah. Welcome. My answer is similar in a sense, when I was a Stanford, I just know I want to be successful. I don't know what that means. I just want to do something that would make a difference and I want to be able to be good at. And so it took me some time to figure out what I like. And I had some question in the Q and A portal. There's a lot of our Java Wall Street repairs. I think yes and no. And it showed me what I don't want. I don't know, not a skills on a way, but also showed me what I don't want. And I know I cannot be good in financial engineering. I know I need to figure out ways to create value and make the impact by being part of something new that can sort of give me a chance to make a bar. And when I was in banking, trying to sit, it was a working M&A department. So there were a couple of self-ciassignants. One is in Vermont, one is Missouri, and one is in both places, one is selling manufacturing in part places, and I don't know what was selling, the manufacturing bathroom accessories, furnishings. And so it was interesting, both are stunning because competition from Asia, they couldn't sustain manufacturing anymore in the cost of economic, so they need a sale for buyer, they need even four buyers. And this was back in 1993, 1994. So sort of howling out what was happening in America started as early as 80s and 90s. You can see trends, single from data points along the way. So that being realized, when they're getting a very interdependent world, certain countries and regions are better doing certain things than the others. So I took the time, beyond learning about specific technical skills, I try to see what is the whole world is evolving around this. And where am I passionate about to make a difference to make an impact? Whether it's being a startup founder or it's being a VC.com later. But along the way, I try to figure out what is that I'm passionate about, what will make me different than others that I have worked with and what from people. In terms of skills, networking of course is important. Technical skills, of course, it's just a nice to have, if you can code and do things. Do you want to be able to persuade people in the competition with writing or through public speaking, all that matter? So it's hard to say which one's more important than the other is to be able to fight your personality, what you gravitate to. Because you're going to be working with or competing with hundreds of thousands of people. So for you to stand out, you've got to do the stuff that you like the most and you're really good at. So figure out what you like and take the time to try it. If it doesn't work out, don't worry about it. Because all goes back into helping you down the road. All the things I've learned as a banker or as a founder or as a growth investor, all help me later in my career, in my second decade to become useful and successful. And Sarah, you know, the things that she was doing at training, help her deal with life as a founder later. When you trade, you don't know that's going to, that's going to make it every three down the road. But just trust that smart people doing interesting things along the way that's something you're passionate about or a time which is to become useful for you as an overall tool set of the things you need to be able to do to be good at. Beautiful. You know, it reminds me. It's like, we only learn by living, right? You don't have all the answers today. We can't really chart what our lives will look like 20 years from now. We might have a vision for it, but we have to get the try things out. We have to iterate not only in our startups and in our organizations, but actually on ourselves. It's exactly right. Yeah, what the refined and more refined answer is. So that's beautiful. Thank you for that. I want to tuck in a few more questions of possible. So maybe coming back to you, Sarah, we have a lot of votes on the question of what kind of real world impact have you seen through the distribution of the grow platform, particularly grow for good, which may be quite new right now or otherwise. Yeah, and you know, sometimes it's interesting. There's three types of impact. One is impact that you make to sort of the operation of an organization or the decisions they make and sort of seeing them drive change in their businesses as a result of sort of suggestions or sort of outputs of your model, right? So that's what I said is the ROI path. And that one's actually sort of, I think, the easiest. The second is sort of where you actively go out to help solve for some type of challenge. And then you're either successful or not. And really, you know, grow for good came about from, you know, a few years ago, we started a data science team at a grow called the Rapid Response Data Science Team. And the goal of the Rapid Response Data Science Team was to be the ER of data science. So if something really unprecedented happened and we needed to build a model super fast, so not through the full engineering lifecycle but prototype the model, put it out there, see if it's so. Record floods and floods in a region that have never experienced it before. And we built this team to do that so that we can put things out to the market really to our customers as fast as possible to get that feedback and see how well the models perform. Well, at the beginning of COVID, another crisis that was happening was the Locust Crisis Across East Africa going into South Asia. And the spread of locust was threatening the lives of hundreds of millions of people. And, you know, with everybody distracted with COVID, there were not enough resources that were being deployed and not enough money being raised for fighting and battling the locusts. And so our Rapid Response Team, plus actually a huge part of the company which is volunteering over, you know, a few days, built out what we called the Locust Impact Kit and we open sourced the models to basically assess both the spread of and the potential impact of locusts on crops in every single country that locusts had been detected. And so scaling sort of a methodology that required flying planes to see if there were locusts to saying actually we can look at a combination of imagery and sort of apply our knowledge of how crop yields work and sort of all the different regions we've done and develop yield models, plus just assessments of how bad the locust impact would be to then do an assessment of how many dollars need to be raised versus what had been being raised by the UN, which at the time was $350 million. And we knew very quickly over $3 billion was needed. And so we opened that up and we got about 43 public organizations around the table. I mean, we were in a 2 a.m. phone calls with governments trying to just help them like wake up to how bad this would be to mobilize that. And Grover Good came really from that experience saying, we did a lot of good. We used the resources we had at a time, frankly, when the company itself was like trying to figure out what COVID meant for us, but it was our role to do that. And so Grover Good was how do we use our platform to let many others do that? Because we as a company can't step in for every crisis considering the pace at which we're facing crises and the cost of these crises is going up and there are going to be many sort of countries and sort of many use cases where they're not necessarily commercial. And so Grover Good exists because of one of these sort of projects we've done. Amazing, amazing. I was wondering, I was actually going to ask you for more detail because I've heard of your work in Locust, but not in that depth. Let me combine to the most popular questions here. And it actually touches upon a little bit about you creating the strategy response team and then Grover Good coming out of it. Every business over time evolves and pivots and we talked about iteration earlier was we could take the pandemic, for example, and effective any and every business on Earth. So was there a period during Grover's history that was challenging for whatever reason that basically caused you to pivot and adapt in a unique way? There's many challenges along the road. And I think it goes back to a point Hans made, though, which is you need to make these incremental changes really, really fast, not wait for massive pivots to occur to redefine who you are. And that's sort of that difference between what I mentioned around sort of mission and vision versus the tactics to get there. And so have we changed the path by which we're getting to our end goal? Absolutely. And we constantly continue to fine tune that path, whether it's determining where exactly to sort of sell our product, how to reach our audience, how to present ourselves to the world and speak about ourselves. That let you know last year one of the big things we did is we did a complete rebranding. Our logo used to be circle and red and that were blue and it has a completely new look. And that involved a massive sort of journey. And it's not a pivot, but it's actually a seminal change in sort of the way that we then interact with sort of the world. And so I think thinking about it as small incremental changes, I would say that's all my job is, is to find out and fine tune what we're doing constantly. And sometimes if you're actually a person that's super structured and you'd like to have complete clarity on what to do, like a startup is disrupting to disruptive to your sort of value all the time. Oh gosh, what a great answer. So I know we only have a minute left. And I do want to close with the question we love asking our guests, which is, once upon a time, Sarah, you were a 20-year-old sitting in the front row, maybe back row, I don't know, of a talk like this, listening to entrepreneurs who are coming before you. Same thing for New Hans, you were sitting in front row, in Toria, in Termin, listening to talks like this. If you could just transport yourself back in time and the person you are today could give the person you were as a 20-year-old, like one sentence of advice. What would you say to the 20-year-old version of yourself? I always think there's something as an owner, not as an agent. It's very easy to say, I want this, I want that. What can you do for me? But everywhere you go, if you think like an owner, that you want to make some country, the country of each and every owner is enjoying, your boss would appreciate that. And you think about, well, how can I make my boss job easier, but any more value? And you know, actually, well, this is what I did, only for your own self, you can promote faster, you can get more responsibility earlier sooner. Because everyone wants to hire someone else that can solve their problem. And so, you think that the owner, not think that as an agent, if you're a career, you can do more career and rice faster, because people will give you more responsibility. Because they know you have their best interest at heart. So that's something that did not know when I was growing up, because I was meeting with one idea, one idea again, I mean, successful, I need this, I want that. And no one, people don't hear a problem. They want to have their own problem solved for it. So if you think like an owner, less than an agent, you will go for it. I want it. I want it. Sarah. Be your authentic self. Don't try to be anything for anybody. Because it's really hard to pretend what thing you're adopting to, to be this one thing versus another. If you are constantly sort of shaping yourself to fit into a world, it's really sort of, it's hard to keep up with yourself, right? And life is hard as it is. So sort of just bring your best and authentic self to what you do every single day. And I think I was very lucky in that I learned that lesson very, very, very, very early on in my career, like when I was 20. And I made that promise to myself. And I've never sort of, you know, I think what you see is always what you get with huge. And it's really, I think, helpful. And that, that, that, that advice was also very good. If you couple, and put together both of our vices, there's two sides of the same coin. It's hard to think like an owner of a problem you don't care about. And that's not the best thing to do. So you have to, you end up doing both. That's how you find the best path for yourself. The entrepreneurial thought leader series is a Stanford E-Corner original production.
