 You are listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Today we have a fabulous panel and I'm going to introduce them all and then we have Tony Perkins who's going to be leading the discussion. Let me give you a little bit of an insight of who we have up here and how lucky we are today. Tim Draper, and of course I mentioned this is the DFJ or Draper Fisher Jervitson Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Lecturer series. So the first thing I need to do is to speak as a nice sponsor. Well, you know what, we keep begging you to show up and hopefully we'll come back again. Tim is a really remarkable key is the Managing Director of Draper Fisher Jervitson and he is known as the father of viral marketing. Way back, what year was it when Hotmail started? 95. 95 came up with the idea of putting little messages at the bottom of the emails to essentially spread a message in a really viral way. And of course that's something we now take for granted all the time. Tim also launched the DFJ Global Network which is an international network of early stage venture capital funds with offices in at least 30 different countries around the world. He is the founder of BizWorld and if you don't know about BizWorld it's a program that teaches entrepreneurship to kids. I've had the pleasure of teaching it for many years and it's just terrific. He has a degree from Sanford in EE and also a Harvard MBA and I love the fact that he was named and always on number one venture capital deal maker in 2008. So that's a nice segue to Tony. Okay. So Tony is the creator and former editor of Red Herring and the CEO of Always On. How many of you in the room get the daily Always On newsletter? Well, if you don't, you should. I know today there are a couple articles I literally sent on to several different people. Really, really interesting. He is consistently ranked as one of the top 10 technology business journalists. He's been a member of the World Economics Forum Media Leaders and was the CEO of Upside Publishing. He basically spends a lot of time chronicling technology and is a regular columnist for the Wall Street Journal. So the third panel we have is Michael Moe. Michael Moe is a founding partner of Think Panture. Is it Pamier? Think Equity. Think Equity. Okay, that's changed. And is a former director of global growth stock research and a manager director of Merrill Lynch was one. And he's been named the best on the street by the Wall Street Journal. So without further ado, we've got our panel talking about the next big thing. Hey. Well, it's always good to be here. I want to note that along with Always On and Stanford Technology Venture Program, we co-produced Stanford Summit every year. We've done that for seven years in a row now. It's in July and if you want to hear about it, talk to either Tina or myself. So in essence, you're wondering why we have such distinguished people here. It's because I think as you've just witnessed, Tina is a force of nature and basically we'll do whatever she tells us to do. So here we are. I wanted to kind of start out, I think, you know, deciphering kind of the current environment here. Let me just ask for a raise of hands. How many of you in the audience feel stressed out about the economy in some way? Well, now I do. So I want to, we're here to relieve your stress, I think, in ours as well. But in order to kind of set the framework, I thought we'd start out with Tim. And I mean, from my perspective, and again, always on hold seven events, our focus is on championing the entrepreneur as a media brand, social network, event company. And I would say that we started seeing softening in the market just about a year ago. And then I think that come October, you know, there was a lot of frightening things going on. But things have kind of eased up a little bit since then. Because I think the venture-backed private company market, a lot because of an open letter, or a letter that ended out on the web by Sequoia Capital kind of froze everybody in our world for a little bit. So looking back on the last 12 months, Tim, how would you kind of analyze the journey that we've been through? Okay, well, I'll do that. But first, I want to say that I've got several ideas for a new bike safety program. First, keep me off a bike. I've had about four accidents where I've hit cars. So, you know, and a lot hit my head. And then I thought you could just paint it with that glow and the dark stuff. Anyway, those are my two ideas. Now I'll get on. And this is from a guy that never drinks. So I think this is one of the great opportunities of the world that we've ever had in our lifetime. First of all, there are cycles. There are natural cycles where there's, there tends to be job creation, job destruction, job creation, job destruction. And it, those same cycles actually go with the private equity business, who grows and then there's job destruction and then the venture capital business and that grows and there's job creation. And then it needs job destruction, needs job creation. And now, clearly, is the time for venture capitalists to really whip into shape. It's a great time for us and it's a really great time for you. In fact, I look at this where the world, you know, a new, if you were studying during this time, basically an economic nuke went off in your, in the world. And, and now is the opportunity of a lifetime to go after something that you've always wanted to go after. You always thought was done the wrong way. And, and go get it because it's, it's the great entrepreneurs that rise to occasions like this. This is, in fact, the greatest companies of the world were all started in depressions and recessions. That includes GE, IBM, Microsoft, Shell, Oil, Johnson and Johnson, Merck. You name it. Any big, huge, successful, 60 year old company started in our recession or depression. It is one of those times when, when the world is scared, they don't know what to do. A lot of people are laid off their jobs. And you being, I mean, this is Stanford, right? I mean, the, and Stanford's gotten a lot better since I was here. And, and, and with great, this is a Spider-Man quote, with great power comes great responsibility. You have the great power, mental power is out there. I can feel them. I'm feeling it. And, and you have great responsibility to go out there and lead the charge in a new direction to build a business that creates profits, employs people and grows, and does something in a new way, where you take something that's been done the same way for years and years and years, and you turn it on its ear with a new technology or a new business twist or, or just a new group of people. And you go after it in a new way. It is, it is your responsibility right now. Go out there and do that. I'm a little more optimistic than Tim. I actually, I think what Tim said I couldn't agree more with. I think it was the bike thing, right? I'm being just on a bike too. But as you take a couple of steps back and kind of look at where we've come from, where we're at, and where we're going, I think the classic recipe of opportunity is where there's problem when there's chaos. The bigger the problem, the greater the chaos, the greater the opportunity. What entrepreneurs do is they solve problems. And, you know, we believe, I believe, that as you kind of look at, you know, what can get this country and can't, it'll leave this global economy out of the funkets in. It's people like that are in this room thinking about where the world can go, taking the risk, and creating solutions for those issues. I think one of the, one of the trueisms that I believe is a great way to kind of guide somebody in today's, you know, very nervous world. Probably the greatest investor of all time, Warren Buffett said, you know, he has the saying that the time to be fearful is when people are greedy and to be greedy when people are fearful. Like, guarantee that people are more fearful today than you've ever seen. And, you know, greedy might, you know, that's how you define the word greedy, but I think the opportunity for opportunistic entrepreneurial for thinking people, they're looking at where, what can be done, it is the most exciting time of my lifetime. It doesn't mean there aren't all sorts of challenges, not all sorts of issues, all sorts of potholes, but it is a time to really do something special. So, that's my general review. Okay. Andy, it's going to be hard to get money to start your business. So, you might have to start it as a, you know, a work for a higher kind of thing, but in the meantime, create something really cool that grows and employs a lot of people and generates a lot of profit and wealth for everybody involved. And we do the work for a higher call? No. So, not to dwell on the 30,000 foot level here, but, you know, again, I want to kind of put this in a perspective before we talk about, get to drill down to the real opportunities. So, how is today different than the internet bubble? Because we saw, people forget, we saw NASDAQ go from 5,500 down to 1,100. So, that's a little bit different than going from 2,800 to 1,300. I think it's, you know, I think the biggest difference is really, and while innovation really never slowed down, and Tim, just to carry forward Tim's point about great companies, made Google basically powered its way, and arguably was created because of the implosion, the dot com bubble, and a lot of other great innovative companies that are kind of powered the way through. It really since 2000, when March 2000, when the internet bubble pricked, you know, it's not been a glorious time for technology and growth companies. And so, I think the reality for all that is that, you know, when you look at things that even like some of the greatest opportunities is when you have to really focus on how you're going to create something that people pay for. So, mine. Well, I think actually, how it affects me as a venture capitalist was we were in the center of the hurricane when it was the internet bubble came and and popped, and we felt every little piece of it. There were some real positives there. One was that if one, in the Silicon Valley, it was great because there were usually both the husband and the wife were working, and if one lost their job, the other one, the other one still had a job, so they weren't in bread lines, and the one who lost their job said, well, I'll just start something. And that created a whole new wave of activity. And so, we were really in the center of that boom and bus. Here, we're sort of collateral damage. It's like the elephant stepped a little too close to our TP. And we got knocked over. But it also is a situation where a great entrepreneur can now look at this and say, this is something that's going to fundamentally change things, and it's going to allow me to do this where I never could have done this before because everybody was doing it this way and that would have been very difficult to do. So there is that now new opportunity that's created by this complete, you know, obliteration of the economic system. So, we're warming you up here. The other night, on Charlie Rose, you saw Mark and Dreson, I don't know if you guys got that. He was the founder of Netscape. He founded Loud Cloud. He's now doing Ning. And there was this very poignant moment where they were talking about, I think, the New York Times, was the New York Times or whatever. And he's talking about the paper version and he kept telling Charlie Rose that they just need to kill it. That print newspapers are a piece of history that you got to bite the bullet and just accept the new reality. So I know I'm the moderator, but I'm going to give a quick opinion myself here on this subject. And basically, and I'd love to give you a reaction to this, but basically during the internet bubble, we pumped out a bunch of fake companies that people bid up and then also they figured out, you know, we spent five years trying to figure out how many pet companies we could put on the internet only to find out the number was zero. And then there was a lot of wreckage regrouping, but a lot of that whole bubble period was based upon a vision of the internet, steamrolling the way people do business and creating what was then called the new economy. My view, my theory right now is that all those things that we talked about that were going to happen, like the end of television, the end of newspapers, all that stuff that we poured a bunch of money in, I think it was going to happen 10 years ago is actually happening now. Okay, and so a lot of the destruction in the market, a lot of the jobs that are being destroyed, are jobs that are being steamrolled a lot by the internet, but increasingly by the green tech movement. Because right now we're doing, we're looking at how we do everything, entrepreneurs are looking at how we do everything and they're going, how can I do that same thing in a way that's better for the environment? And that's bringing the Silicon Valley mentality into the whole green space, which I think is super exciting. So the way I kind of see it, the reason I share your optimism is because we are the future. Silicon Valley is the future and a lot of the jobs that we're seeing being destroyed are never going to come back, but it is our world that is really causing the disruption and therefore is going to be the one that creates the jobs. Does that sound good? Yeah, everything but the fake company thing. I actually think they were real companies, they got some, got ahead of themselves, and I think actually all of those companies, some became features of other companies, but the internet is bigger than it was in 2009 and 2000, it's getting, it's even bigger. We're all a much bigger part of it. It really did move things, and I think that's absolutely right. And what Tony alluded to was GM Ford and Chrysler are all sort of an old way of creating a car. It pollutes. It's low gas mileage. It's not that safe. It doesn't go that fast. Now you can get a Tesla for now it's a reasonable price. But it's zero to 60 and four seconds and it costs a lot less than any kind of high cost for our year of course. And it's a new way of looking at things. That entrepreneur said, hey, battery technology is such that these lines are going to cross and they're going to cross pretty soon, where you're going to get better performance, better gas mileage out of a car that's electric, all electric, than you did out of a gas powered car. And I think the world is starting to recognize that. People are starting to think, well why don't I buy at least a hybrid and the Detroit guys just didn't get it. And this is happening all over the world in India. There's a company called the Riva that has a terrific electric car that turns out it's more expensive than the gas alternative to buy but to own over a five year period it's less expensive. There are some major breakthroughs in clean technology. I think actually the most powerful one we have is going to be for many years to come is nuclear power. And that has to be put into place. We need more nuclear power absolutely. But there's some really cool new technologies. There's one where we funded that has it's like a kid's experiment. You put a whole bunch of mirrors around and you point them at a tin can and you heat it up and it generates steam and that steam then drives a turbine and that turbine runs electricity. It turns out this is the most efficient way to generate electricity except maybe nuclear power. And it comes from an entrepreneur with a wild vision. And all of these things are starting to happen. I think if you look at a big prop, if your entrepreneur is out there, don't waste your time on a small problem. Go after a big problem. Go after something really important. Say, gee this seems to be something that a lot of people, God start a new kind of bank. Go after something that really matters to people because if you're going to dedicate your life to it, it might as well be something really important. And when you finally accomplished it, you will be much more satisfied. You'll employ more people and you'll make a bigger impact on the world. You look at the history of disruptive technology and you go back even the human nature doesn't change much. You go back to the railroad industry. That was a disruptive technology when it came out. It got overfunded. Speculation went rampant. Bankruptcy in 1892 basically $2 billion in those dollars. In the 1890 dollars went away. Obviously railroad industry kept on going. It got much, much bigger than even people could anticipate. Automobiles in the turn of the century in 1900, you had 240 new automobile companies built in Detroit, which by the way at that time was the Silicon Valley of its day. All sorts of capital, all sorts of bankruptcy basically three companies that barely can survive today. But that's just a natural course of disruptive. There's nothing been anything more disruptive than the internet, which is Tony said. If you look at what the predictions that were made 10 years ago, people said ridiculous. Actually, in many cases it's been exceeded. And so now when you look at energy technology, green technology, and I think people see the massive problem and all the different things. There's a rush of capital that's coming into this industry. I don't know that if one thing I know for sure, looking out maybe over the next 10 or 20 years, I don't think there's probably going to be an area that creates larger companies. The way you're going to see in that area, just because of the problems and the size of the market and the size of the solutions that are available. That will be made available. Yeah, I might hit on a very interesting point. And I want to hit it hard. And I think the people who are older in this crowd will recognize this more than the people who are younger. But there has been so much fundamental change that we've gone through over our lifetimes. And if you go back 100 years, it's unbelievable. I mean, before that they didn't have running water, didn't have electricity. There are a lot of things that we didn't have. And things that we can't even get along with now. I remember threatening. Just threatening to take my daughter's cell phone away. And that was just a panic. She was attached, completely attached to her cell phone, whereas 10 years ago, there were very few cell phones out there. And they were big and they were in cars. And so the world changes very, very quickly. Technology marches along very quickly. In fact, it's accelerating because the free world's gotten bigger. There are a lot more great minds out there pushing the edge of technology. And that is moving faster and faster. And so when you start your business, think five years out, but push it a little bit. Go from a fast self-navigating car to a flying fast navigating car. Or just the idea, just push yourself a little further because there are a lot of people in this world and there are a lot of people innovating. And our worlds are going to change more than we ever imagined. Financial bounces aside. You're going to see the finances go down, go up. Turns out there's more innovation. If you look at Moore's Law, there's more innovation in a downturn in the economy than there is when things are going really well. So push it and say, what's going to be the world going to be like in five years? And then say, okay, what's it going to be like the year after that? Yeah. And I think just to expand on that point and turn it back to 24 question, I think so often, if you took a poll here, what are the areas that people should be in? It's kind of like what's hot here and now? Is it supposed to really looking over the horizon? And I think one thing the history shown for sure is that whatever would turn out to be the most proper thing in this room probably wouldn't be five years from now in terms of what the success would be. So thinking about what are the true megatrons that are taking place in society and the global marketplace in terms of globalization, the internet, convergence, demographics. I mean, demographics is the most powerful indicator where the future is. In 1800, just for an example, you had basically the average person lived at 40 years old. The average woman had eight children, six of which died before the time they got to adolescence. You know, you'll look today, all of a sudden, the population of the world is doubled in the last 50 years. People have 2.1 children per household. But you can see these patterns emerge and therefore looking at what looks like five years from now or 10 years from now or 15 years from now. I look at those patterns in position where the puck's going as opposed towards Ben. I think that's where you can create some real opportunities. So I'll throw another one of my thoughts on it. You guys see what you think. You know, when I look back historically, it's very interesting. Down here on Alpine Road, there's a little coffee shop called Conditory. And in the mid-70s, Steve Jobs and Steve Woesniak, they used to show up there and they had the Home Brew Computer Club where they would bring their hand-built PCs in there. And their whole vision was that they thought that everybody in the world was going to need a PC, which was like this ridiculous idea in the mid-70s. By 1986, Microsoft had gone public and I would argue is that's when the PC generation really started to drive the innovation economy. And now when you look at the Fortune 500 or whatever, a vast majority of the companies at the top were built out of that generation. Now for the first time in my life, I see a generational change that has occurred, which you can call it all sorts of things. I call it the instant messaging generation. The folks who grew up with real-time communications starting about 10 years ago, now they're 25 years old at the center and they're entering the workforce and they have completely different behavior patterns. They're virtual, they're always on, they communicate in real-time, they use all sorts of different text messaging, etc., etc., which is really changing the landscape. So back to your GM analogy, we hold a going green conference, you go out there and there's 15 alternative cars in our little auto garden. 30 days later, I'm watching these guys dinosaurs begging for money from Congress and it's kind of like there was a disconnect here. So I think we're going through this whole generational change and I think the most important thing for people to embrace is that whatever you do, you better put that new product or service place it on top of this new generation because they're now in charge. And if you try to present them with any, whether printed newspaper or a television program that they have to run home at 9 o'clock to watch or whatever, they're just they're just not going to go for it. So I think that's where it gets Mark and Dreson's telling Charlie Rose that the New York Times needs to kill their printed product and just go all online. I mean, do you see that same generational impact which is really, you know, we're the PC guys really. We're a PC generation. But I think there's I mean a couple key things that have just you seen things be accelerated. One is just how kid, and if you want to understand the future, look at your kids, you know, Tim talked about the chaos with his daughter. My daughter lost her iPhone. A week ago, an APB went out on Facebook to her 600 million friends saying I can't find my phone because it was the, it's not that's a phone. It's her life. It's a computer. It's everything she does is off off that platform. And I think as you look, how many people here do tweet on Twitter? I mean, you look at this to come and to exist 18 months ago, you got six million people doing live time digital communication. So I mean, I think it's clearly the mobile computing coupled with how people expect to get their information, how they expect to communicate. You know, man, it's totally radically different. And I think it's and it's powerful and it's an important concept to understand. I had a great tweet experience. It was really fun. I typed this thing in. If somebody asked me, hey, I'm about to go speak on what are the 10 biggest problems a startup can have or something. So I just typed out some and then I said, hey, do you mind if I'm going to put this on my blog? Put it on my blog and I put it on my blog that night. The next day, I went and I saw this, I saw about five startups. One of the startups was this new kind of tweeting startup that makes tweeting a lot easier. And there were 30 comments on my 10, he just brought up. He just said, oh, here are the 30 comments. Then the next entrepreneur comes and he goes, here's why I'm going to be successful. Here are the 10 things that can make a startup fail that you said. And this is why I'm going to be successful. It was amazing. And that was the next day. I mean, for the young people here, they say, oh, of course. And I'm thinking, whoa, 30 people actually commented on my thing before I even woke up in the morning. And that tweet tweeting is really starting to proliferate. Yeah, tweeting is sweet. I'm a tweeter. So again, back to this idea. I mean, I think there's been a huge, huge behavioral change. I'll give you an example of a statistic which I think is really interesting. You know, somewhere between 30 and 40% of the time that we're consuming media and content were on the internet. Okay. Yet we just had our on media conference back in New York. You know, somewhere between only six and seven percent of the ad dollars are invested in advertising on the internet. So there's just like gigantic delta between the old Madison Avenue world and how they're investing their advertising dollars on behalf of their clients and where people are, where the eyeballs actually are. And in the other piece, it's going to make that even more powerful as you see that catch up is that 30%. If you look at younger people, they spend more than 30%. And that's all going to be going up. So just in the online advertising sector alone, it seems like there's going to be a lot of cool companies created trying to figure help Madison Avenue bridge that gap between the ad dollars that aren't being spent and where all the eyeballs are. I mean, yeah, you know, this reminds me of something. We have an investment company called Glam. And this sends this is also a message for why an entrepreneur is often better off with less money than more. We we had invested in this company and he was spending it at a reasonable rate, but we didn't really have a business model. This was just a little site for women to go see fashion and that kind of thing. And it wasn't really taking off and we said, you've got to cut your expenses in a half. And he was so mad at me, he was just furious. And he said, what do you mean? We got plenty of money in the bank. This is good for at least 18 months, whatever. What are you telling me? I got to cut it in half. Then we're going to have money for three years or whatever. You're totally wasting your money. And I said, I said, no, we got to cut this in half until we got a business model. And he just walked away so pissed. And then he came back about a month later. And he said, thank you so much. And he said, I'm so glad you came up with this. And I thought, well, I didn't come up with anything. And he said, well, what we discovered in going through our real business model was that we can sell ads for all those bloggers out there that have been blogging to our site. And they all want to share revenue with us. And so we're changing the whole business model. And we're going after this. And now, Glam is the 10th largest media site in the world. And it came from nowhere. It came from just forced less money. But you can grow very, very quickly because we all communicate so much faster. And if you have some new way of using a cell phone or tweeting or whatever it is that you're doing, it will proliferate around the world much, much quicker. And that will allow you to get to a billion people much, much quicker. And by reaching those billion people, you can advertise to them. You can get them to pay for a subscription for something. You can ship them something. Any number of things, but it can happen just like that. And so my belief is that you're going to get to companies are going to get to a billion dollars in value faster and faster and faster and faster. Well, you two didn't exist five years ago. Today, it gets a billion hits a day for my daughter. You two. My daughter is exactly, you know, as a more important network than NBC. And when you look at these different networks, whether it's Skype, which I think, you know, is 400 million people on the Skype network. Because as I'm speaking, 10 million people are on Skype. You look at Facebook, 200 million people. There's 25 million mobile, so they got a mobile computer, which is a huge, huge, huge trend. The phone is your computer. Now, 25 million mobile Facebook users, 4 million people use it every single day. And this is just getting more velocity to this whole mobile network. Yeah. One interesting statistic that I looked at was if you look at the top 10 websites in 2005 versus the top 10 websites today, there are five new brands that are on that. So that means just in the last three and a half years, five companies, by the way, all of which were placed were instant messaging generation driven brands replaced five big, you know, large brands like MSN fell off the list, eBay fell off the list. So again, I think that just is a great illustration of opportunity. I love that glam example. So I want to just kind of focus in on it because I think if we're talking about the next big thing, there's several big glam opportunities out there. So what exactly happens? You had glam. They were creating their own content trying to be their own site. But then they then you told them the cut in half. So then that forced them to go and aggregate other blogs like glamour blogs into their site. And they said, hey, if you do that on our site, we'll sell the ads and then we'll share the revenue with you. Is that the business book? Yeah. And then of course they moved from fashion to beauty to I don't know, gardening, whatever, health. And now they've got a men's site that's brash and they call it brash. And it's the same kind of thanks sports, whatever. And so they're covering all these categories, all these bloggers, get a great deal. These guys sell ads and they split it with the blogger. And it's amazing that that business model just came from a forced, you know, forcing people to get sort of creative on the thing. So in theory, you could go over to the Stanford bookshop and stand in front of the magazine rack and say there's a glam opportunity behind every brand. Yeah. Right. Because if you believe Mark Andreessen, there will be no magazine rack in about three years because there will be no more print. Which will be not very exciting. Okay. So that's the media area. What about the whole entertainment? Is there legs in the entertainment area? I'll give you a little, you'll learn that I'm full of statistics here. Disney for the first time in their SEC filing in 2008 noted that they had a quote unquote meaningful digital media business. Okay. And my insiders tell me that at about 40 billion in revenue, their digital media related businesses about two billion of that. And underneath that would be they bought Penguin, which is the social network for young kids. They distribute tens of millions of featured films over iTunes. So that's becoming a huge generator of sales direct sales versus their DVD business, which is flattening out. So it seems to me that if two billion out of 40 billion is digital media today, that if you were to project out, say five years, that number is going to go to close to 50% of their revenue. So again, how are they going to do that? They're going to, in part, have to go out and find the club penguins of the world and build their digital media business while they're just kind of getting whatever blood out of the, they can out of their old paradigm, like television network or whatever and push it forward. I mean, do you guys see that same opportunity in the media business as well? Cool. Virtual Disneyland. So you can go do your 3D avatars and you go through, hey Mickey, that'd be fun. I think, I actually think that, you know, by looking at Disney, you say, you know, look, it's an old, tired, big, huge business. They're going to be laggards into the digital world. They're going to go in screaming and kicking and maybe they'll buy some properties, but I think they, you know, they have some big cash cows. They've got Disneyland and they've got all those movies that they keep pounding out. Now, of course, the delivery of those movies is going to all be digital. In fact, that guy's watching one right now. But, yeah, I think that's all moving along. In fact, you know, you'll start seeing your movies on the iPhone too. And I think Disney should get, you know, Disney and all of those content providers should get in front of that sort of thing and put their content into new forms, because that's how they're going to just keep staying current. But it's classic, the classic innovators dilemma, which is even if they know what the reality looks like, it's so tough to kill what has been their cash cow and what their business was all built upon. So I was, two weeks ago, I was down at a media x-day where they had a big media business in, which will go unnamed. And they understand the reality of their historic business, but how they switch it to a digital one and they want to figure out which way to do it, but it's going to create challenges. But the reality of what you just said going from 2 billion to 40 to something approaching 50%, 50%. I think that's reality. But when you talk about entertainment and throwing other pieces in, I mean, the whole gaming area is so big. And look at this, you know, the iPhone is a platform to build games. It saw a couple of weeks ago, the first millionaire building an app on the iPhone, who would create a million dollars of revenue building a gaming application on the iPhone a month, one developer boom, it took off and all of a sudden, to Tim's point, you got 17 million of these devices out there. Boom. It's exciting to see kind of the leverage, if you will, to the digital model. So just on the iPhone platform itself, there's a whole new marketplace, a new marketplace of brands waiting to happen and get draper money and take off. Yeah. So make it different enough, make it something that is that the iPhones never been used for. Yeah, that's something that we might consider. It was interesting. I just had dinner in Tahoe with the guy who worked as the head of the iPhone group for several years and, you know, was known as being the father of the iPod. That was his idea. So he says. And anyway, you know, he was just talking about what even Apple. Steve Jobs. Yeah. He says as many fathers and pillars. It just shows you that, you know, one man doesn't necessarily think of all the good ideas, although we all love Steve. But what he was saying is even, you know, Steve is really a PC generation guy. He is the father of the PC generation. And even he, when you look at the stages of the iPhone, had to kind of be dragged, kicking, and pushing to open up the iPhone to new apps. Okay. So I mean, think about it. The most fun that you have on your iPhone today is finding cool new apps that radically, you know, change your life and make them better and make you find things quicker and entertain you and the whole thing. So I thought that was an interesting anecdote. But again, it plays back to this idea that there is a generational change here. And open is one, you know, seems to be the operative word. Now, free is also in there somewhere. And for guys that want to make money free is kind of a scary word. But how, while marketing is free marketing, which is good because it means lower expenses. But how does, are you guys worried about free and open hurting the top line at all? Well, I think free is a great way of marketing your product. You have to get it past a certain point before you are a valuable commodity in general. In general, people don't really want to pay a lot more for those little iPhone games. They want to try them for a while and then spread them to their friends and then when they get out there. And free really works if you interconnect, if it's more of a network kind of thing, where if I send it to you, you send it to your friends, they send it to their friends. That kind of thing works really well for something that's free. I mean, free works well in that way. That you know it's going to spread. Free for something that isn't going to spread that people are just going to buy is a lot tougher. I think that's a lot tougher. So I think you, to create viral marketing, you have to think in terms of, you know, it goes from you to your friends, from their friends to their friends to their friends. And it spreads geometric with a geometric progression. And that's where free really matters. You know, there's one other thing that's really important I think to think about during this kind of time. And that is, I call it the deal. I was talking to my daughter and she said, well, you know, why do you have, why do you make a deal? And I compared it to shopping and suddenly her eyes lit up, which was kind of funny. But in shopping, you're making a deal. And if you make a deal, you're both better off. No matter what that deal is, you're both better off because you made the deal and you like it. And they made the deal and they like it. And you're, you're both better off. You buy something in a store. You're better off. And the store is better off. And all the people that made that are better off. And they all create more and more jobs. And that works in business too. You make a deal with somebody in business. Both of you are better off. And you've now created the beginnings of a new potential network of people that you've affected and have improved. And so, so focus on making deals. I mean, Bill Gates and I mean, think of the number of deals he's made, but also think of all the deals anyone's made in buying Microsoft software. And they're all better off because of it. So, so go out and do deals and that builds an economy and that grows an economy. If you're alone, if you don't do deals, this is what I said to my daughter, if you don't do deals, let's say you're a, you're a zucchini farmer. And you don't do any deals. Everything you see is going to be a zucchini. And that's all you're going to be eating. But, you know, if you do a deal with the guy who does the tomatoes and a deal with the guy who has the, the cow farm, then, you know, suddenly you got a cheeseburger there. And, and it's a better deal for everybody. It's the zucchini cheeseburger. But, but I think people are reticent to do this and it, sometimes your deals will fail. You know, you got to be prepared for that. Sometimes you'll buy something and just won't work or sometimes you'll do something and just won't happen and sometimes a business will go out of business. But, if you just keep doing these deals, you're all going to be better off and so are all the people around you and so are all the people around them. It's going to, it has a ripple effect that is really powerful. So, think in terms of that deal. Every time you shake hands. Make a deal. So, I got to ask you, Tim. Hot meal never generated. It had a great viral marketing. It was the first radically viral brand. But, you never generated revenue. You too, but yet you sold to Microsoft for 400 million or whatever it was. You too, same thing. It's now, I think, the number one site on the web, right? But still, there was really no revenues associated yet they sold the Google for what? 1.3 billion. So, do you still get, do you get excited about, well, I know why, because people overpaid. But, but now, okay, I would disagree. I think people underpaid because for a couple of reasons. Think about Microsoft's marketing budget. It's, I don't know. Would you know hundreds of billions? Well, it's not hundreds of billions because that's not the revenue. But, it's a lot. 50 billion. Right, that's a lot. It might be 50 billion dollars. By buying Hotmail, they got one of the greatest marketing vehicles in the world for a simple 400 million dollars. So, relative, it was like 100, 1 100th of their marketing budget. And they got this incredible thing that reached now up to 500 million people. That was a huge steal. In fact, if you ask Bill Gates, what was the best acquisition he ever did? It's Hotmail. Yeah, absolutely. And I think Google's best acquisition was YouTube. And for a similar reason, when they paid 1.4 billion for it, they calculated that it was worth 14 billion in advertising revenue to Google. So, not just the marketing, but how it moved up the scales, how it moved up the Google ranks, how people would pay more, they'd be online more, all that stuff. It ended up being worth 14 billion dollars to Google. So, it's interesting. You can build an enormous business that doesn't have any revenue, as long as there is a partner that you can do a deal with that can take advantage of what you've built. I just saw a Twitter got funded at $250 million of valuation. It has zero revenue. So, it's a lot of a freeze of life and wealth. And I got to bring up Skype because it ties into our Stanford thing here. Tim funded Skype. And then I don't know how many years ago, but at our Stanford Summit with STVP, we gave Skype company of the year. And Tim and Nicholas Zendstrom, the founder, being into Stanford at 8 o'clock in the morning from Estonia right after a board meeting so that they could accept the award for the company of the year. And that was the first public showing of Skype video, which has basically changed most of our lives. And that was another company that sold for billions of dollars that had no revenue. That one actually did have revenue because they have Skype out and it turned out it was becoming a phone company. So, I'm surprised phone companies didn't buy it. But I got to give incredible credit to Tony. I was supposed to speak at his event. And I said, Tony, I'm so sorry, I can't speak at your event. I'm going to be in Estonia and it's going to be a little bit of a trick. And I said, can I do it by video somehow? And this is before video conference was, it was a very difficult thing to pull off. And Tony goes, hey, do you think you can get that Nicholas guy on there with you? And we do sort of like a video teleconferencing? And I said, okay, we're going to give it a shot. But this is a great risk taker because that could have been just an hour of downtime for his whole conference. Everybody staring at a blank screen and Tony doing a song and dance. But instead, Nicholas and Janis took this on as a challenge because they were just doing a beta of their Skype video. And they were just starting it. They hadn't even actually launched it. But they were thinking, well, God, we can certainly pull this off. They shouldn't use somebody else's video conference in machine. So as great entrepreneurs, they loaded, they basically took everybody's bandwidth for that hour that they possibly could. And they loaded it all up. They had the peer to peer system. So they artificially loaded it up. And this thing came in clear as a bell. We spoke, but we had a great time. We had a great time. Did I say? Yeah, you're saying the Skype song? Skype. Oh, Skype. And put this in his journal perspective. The big rumor on that around that time was that Yahoo was wanting to buy Skype for 100 million. And Tim and all his billions was going, no way. And they ended up song for four billions. So it was good that you waited. So this part of the discussion just shows you that if you generate revenue in your company, you risk evaluation. Because then they have something to measure. So Michael's going to talk about some of his past social learning just for one second. Then we're going to open it up to our lovely. No, it's in it. And it just is you think about big ideas and opportunities. I think one of the one of the areas that's emerging is in the whole area of social learning. The internet's democratized learning, increasing access, lowering the cost. And I think now with social learning, what you're going to see is improve the quality. Going on as a company, Tony started actually that just got it at warden. And I just think when you see what's going on in that marketplace and the importance of knowledge in the knowledge marketplace and the global marketplace, that's a huge idea. Yeah, so to kind of wrap up that thought, I think if you look at Facebook and MySpace and Twitter, all of these great new companies and applications have conditioned all of us to change our behavior. And to do things in new ways. And now that behavior, those kids are in the workforce. And they're going to need, they're going to take those behavior patterns into the business world. And that in my mind is going to create a bunch of big thing opportunities in the whole professional enterprise space. I just met a company today, I forgot what it's called, but they do a Twitter for the office environment, which is, and the question, you know how it says Tony is and then you fill it in. It says, what are you working on now? Or I'm working on this now. And so you know, it encourages collaboration and let people in your virtual workforce know, hey, this is, I'm working on this project now, this proposal now. And it's just a way to keep people up with what you're doing. So if somebody, you know, in your world goes, oh, I've been thinking about that and they can contribute to it, they'll contact you. Okay, with that, I know we have a couple mics here. I want to open up the discussion to our world out here. Anybody want to ask one of these fine gentlemen a question? There you go. Hi, my name is Ed Chow, I'm an entrepreneur here in Silicon Valley. And my question is for the panel, which is, do you see that the business strategies used for the internet entrepreneurs use? Do you see them working in the clean tech industry, or are we talking about totally different ball games and business strategies? Well, you know, there's actually a great company that we that we funded called EnterKnock and it combines the two. What they do is they allow people to right now, if you, if you create your own energy, you can sell it to the grid. And, and you, if you sell it at the right time, you know, normally people just sell it whenever they can, but they could get anywhere from five cents a kilowatt hour to $2 a kilowatt hour. What EnterKnock does is they go in there just before these guys are about to sell it to the grid and they say, no, wait two hours. It's going to be noon. Everybody's air conditioner is going to go on and it's going to be worth $2 a kilowatt hour. And, and so they're using electronic technology, I mean, or software to apply to the clean tech world. And I think there are many, many other applications like that. In fact, a solar panel is really a semiconductor. And that, and, and there are better and better solar panels happening because semiconductors are getting to be smaller and smaller. We're getting toward nano tech solar panels as well as nano tech semiconductors. So I think all technologies have opportunities to emerge with one another. Actually, guess what you're thinking? One thing I didn't mention was, if you're not for free trade, think about not dealing with China right now. Your computer would be made up of a cathode ray tube. Instead of memory, you'd have a little string around your finger. And, and instead of a processor, you would, you'd have to use your own. And I think, I think there is, you know, the idea of, of any kind of protectionism is so ludicrous in this world that has allowed us to all communicate, to, to allow geographic borders to fall and to allow all of us to make deals with one another, wherever we might be. And we all are better off because of it. It's, it's one of those things. Anyway, this is more than you asked for, but it is so important. So, you know, write your congressman. Free trade! Hey! Just one, one other free trade or die. Protectionism, I mean, basically you get back into the cave. One other point, just on the green tech and the internet convergence, or, you know, I think you look at energy intelligence and leveraging the internet infrastructure to optimize energy and the cloud computing. And that's obviously a huge area that's, that's, that's evolving. You see a lot of cool companies being created in that space and an important area. And will we be hearing the rest of the semester tonight? I've been asked not to sing. I can understand why. Yeah. I did the asking. This is embarrassing, I'm not embarrassing, but this is our editor at Always On who's probably going to ask a hard question. I have. Ben all went to Stanford. You need Stanford and always on. This is a question for Tim. Sorry, I'm losing my voice a little today. I thought your point about not needing to monetize a technology as long as you represent a cost savings to some bigger technology firm was interesting, you know, the hot mail or YouTube, either than representing a marketing savings. But to use our two specific examples that we've been banding about on the panel, Twitter and Facebook, Zuckerberg doesn't really seem to want to sell. Twitter refused actually to be acquired by Facebook recently, or those were the rumors. I don't know if they were ever confirmed. So if they actually want a liquidity event like an IPO instead of just selling this in bigger company, can you rub your crystal ball and tell me how they're going to make money? Yeah, I actually think there's some really great interesting applications for both of those. Some are clearly advertising. I mean, they're going to be able to put ads on there whenever they decide to. Well, in the margin of using interview, he's saying that they don't want to. But then they can make deals. I mean, how many Facebook users are there out there? They can make deals with all these other people who do figure out how to make money on Facebook. All the widgets on Facebook are, a lot of them are created by entrepreneurs who have come to them and said, how do we get on your network? And they are building things that actually do generate revenue. And they share it with Facebook. So Facebook actually does make money. And Twitter is probably going to make money in similar ways. I think they buy. Anyway, they do it by doing deals. It's all about the deal. Yes, my question is to the panel in general. There's a lot of talk about these big communities are being formed. But if we look at a big market here in the US, the Hispanic market is a huge market. It's the fastest growing demographic. But it's really hard to find venture capital that's interested in investing there. So any thoughts around that? Because it's really the fastest growing demographic in the US. Well, I think it's obviously a huge opportunity. And one of the things that, you know, we talk about Facebook, but Tony talked about Penguin. And all these different demographics that you play to, I mean, you know, anyway, you should do research about Facebook. It's interesting because it's really not popular as popular with the minority community, you know, with minority communities. And I think you look at target marketing, the specific demographic groups. It's been an historical recipe to get higher, higher CPMs and higher opportunities. So I think there is terrific opportunity in that market. You see some, you see some, I see a handful of companies being created there. And as many as you think, given the power of that demographic group. We've actually funded two, three that kind of fit in that demographic. There's something, the non-Sierra, that's like a new kind of bank that's person to person lending through, and most of them are Latino. And most of the customers Latino. And another company that is sort of a drugstore. That is specific. Yeah, Maricada, anyway. Then there's another, there's another one that is very interesting. And it starts with the Latino community. It's healthcare. It's, it's a new healthcare system where they, people just go in, they pay 40 bucks, they get their antibiotic from the doctor, they get the bandaid put on, they get their, their air, their air cast put on their ankle, whatever. And then they're out. And there, these guys have done a series of deals with Walmart. And, and the Latino community has flocked to this because they're, you know, they don't want to be in some healthcare system that is failing and a disaster. And they'd rather just go in, see the doc and come out. Now, they're the early innovators. And they're the ones who are coming in. And then all the rest of us are going to say, hey, what, you know, what am I doing with this weird health insurance thing and paying all this money when I can just go to the doc, pay my 49 or $99. And I'm out of there and I've got a great program. So yes, there is great innovation coming from that community. Yes, it has a specific demographic and it is a growing community and we're aware of it. Okay, this is a side note Brazil. And I know they speak Portuguese there, but that's a huge, huge market right now where there seems to be a lot of momentum and a lot of people looking at that for new entrepreneurial opportunities. Does gentleman here? I'm just going to add a little something on that and you're seeing this model not just in this community. A lot of the innovation that was mentioned is happening on mobile and alternative payment models like the world mobile commerce, the company that won just your innovation is a mobile payment system company. And they're starting to get started and they're looking at the network in their first test with portfolios in Kenya where there are about 10,000 paid customers and killing Western beauty. And you see in the United States too, a company is like MetroBCS. There's a major trend called flat rate pricing like with the medical services. But for finance, they do like pre-paid credit cards. The only problem is the last mile for people who are unbanked, turning that money on these devices into actual 18-year-old dollar. Yeah, and it's $100 billion market that's growing 10 to 15% but I mean it's not that much more. That's going on and we actually have done one in India called MCHEC. And one in China, which I slipped my mind right now, and one in Vietnam. So absolutely, that's a really cool opportunity. I don't know why we have all these credit cards. They waste wallet time whatever. You got a cell phone, just go sweep it, swipe it, whatever and get it. Well, the product is like you said earlier, transition. Most of the revenue, 80% of the outside, which is great, import for us. There's a problem where we're used to paying $10 to $100 for things. In the second and third world, they're used to paying $1 to $10 because that's about what they make. But there's a nice, next is coming up with companies like we do a lot of widgets based on open social and Facebook. There are companies that are being able to turn information from the second and third world into tens of dollars here because they're saving, surveying other companies that research costs. And then they do micro transactions. And then the last part is can you, for people who don't have bank access, put that capital on a device that they can use to spend. And that's where there's going to be savings for companies here and profits for people who have information we use. So it's going to give us a reverse digital flow card. That'd be our first Kenyan company. We've sanded our way. Yeah. We'll talk afterwards. All right. I'm interested in what you think the prospects are for the emergence of the semantic web and the Internet of Things. And if you think prospects are positive, sort of how, sort of your prediction of how that might evolve and sort of what time frame we're looking at. It's cool. I mean, I think it's cool because the semantic web is already happening. It's not like when's it going to happen. It's already happening. You've got people are helping people with their problems. It's happening in customer service. People, you know, companies say I can't handle all these customer service calls. Let's just send it out to the other customers who love giving the advice. And so it's going in that direction. We have a great company called Radar Networks that is trying to build a semantic web that everybody then will add to. And it's a little, it works a little the way a Wikipedia might have. I think that it's just a wonderful thing that we've got going. And there's so many things. And the semantic web can take on different forms. So I think you're going to have a lot of fun with it. So if you got one of those, go for it. I don't know what's going to happen where the big opportunity is going to be. Customer service is definitely one of them. But I think there are going to be all sorts of other things. Information, it will be a better way to search than Google. I think it turns into information, turns into knowledge. And certainly is the future. I think the Tim's point in how quickly and where the specific area is. But it's Web 30 Web 4. Are there any particular challenges you see that need to be overcome? People have to try it. People have to use it. Okay, unfortunately Tina, tell me we have the opportunity for one more question. So I'll turn to this gentleman. But it should note that Mike and Tim agreed that they'll hang around till about nine or ten tonight. So if you have questions, but you might have to buy them a beer. My name is Lane, I represent Togetherville.com. I'm optimistic. We've seen you. That's the most special learning that says learning that we talked about. I hope that expansion will help democratize learning for kids. Do you think this will happen more through the classroom or at home with family? So I miss part of your question. Do you think the social learnings going to happen more in the traditional classroom? Do you think it's going to be outside? Will the expansion of the virtual social learning happen in the classroom or at home with families? Oh, I think it's going to be all over. I think it's absolutely going to be embedded in the classroom. But I think it's going to carry over into the families and outside into the communities, which I think is very exciting. And by the way, you know, enhance the learning tremendously. I mean, you look at all the ways that people learn. The worst way to learn is the way we're doing it right here at us talking to you. You know, the interaction in the community and the sharing, it just goes off the charts in terms of how people retain things and what they learn. Yeah, I think it's neither. I think it's fun. Yeah. I think it fun is what makes it all happen. That's where you get more and make it more fun. You all learn, you all grow. I think you work better that way. Okay. My name is Joji. My name is Joji. I also have this question because this is a very important question. You're taking my question. It's very important to stick around. I would like. Yeah. That's important because everybody considers the global economy a crisis. I tell you why. You know what? Can I ask a favor? This is being podcasted and we have a time limit. So I'm going to ask you to talk to these guys afterwards. So thank you so much. I'm sure it's really interesting. I'm sure it's going to be a very good time to go on and talk to you. Okay. Thank you very much. I just hope you all agreed that this has been an incredible way to end entrepreneurship week. I want to thank our amazing panel. Thank you. You have been listening to the entrepreneurial thought leader series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program.
