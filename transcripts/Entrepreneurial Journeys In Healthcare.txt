 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. How many of you known or had acquaintance with somebody who suffers from arthritis, I mean, in a big way? It's not good and it can be very, very debilitating for loved ones. So this is something that's going to be very interesting to hear about, no matter whether you cared about entrepreneurship or not. This is easy to get interested in. But it also shows, again, what we're trying to achieve with ETL throughout the years. They have a mix of entrepreneurs and CEOs as well as their supporters like venture capitalists and authors, for example. But have a mix of sectors, which, as you know, Steve Blanks' course that meets after this, takes a look at. So we're happy to have somebody from the life science field, just like we're happy to celebrate Green Tech and Information Technologies throughout the year with the seminars. So today, it's healthcare. So let's give a big welcome to Bill Stanford. Thanks. Well, thank you for this opportunity. The title of my talk is going to be the importance of purpose in the entrepreneurial journey. And I think you'll see the significance of that as we move on. Ten years into my career, I was vice president of a billion dollar division of a six billion dollar company. Our scope included 40,000 products and seven market segments in diagnostics. On the path to this position, we had the opportunity to be involved in multiple product launches, new venture launches, turnaround and restructuring assignments. As exciting as these experiences had been, in my current position, I felt the degree to which I could truly change the business, chart new courses, pursue new targets with somewhat limited. The organization I was in at the time didn't seem to be as interested in breaking through to the next level. I was frustrated. The opportunities I had pursued previously where we could do the analysis, make the decision, move forward, weren't the same today. With this as a backdrop, I want to take you to a specific meeting, a so-called lateral coordination meeting where the heads of sales of market for five or six divisions were all gathered together to talk about their goals, their objectives, places we could go as an organization. And as I was strenuously arguing for a new direction and how we should pursue our competitors in a different fashion, I'll never forget the break that we took after that discussion. A colleague caught me in the hall and subbed something that would change my life forever. His comment was, relax. It's only a job. It's not a crusade. And that comment hit me like a ton of bricks. Because to me, if I was going to be investing my life, my time, it better be a crusade, it better not just be a job. Within five minutes, I gathered some of my thoughts and called a friend in the search business. And eight weeks later, I was running my first company, SCEO. My first experience as an entrepreneur. I want to talk about that experience in a little while. But I want to start by saying, as you think about your life, your career, that you think about signing on to a worthy crusade, a worthy cause, something that has deep meaning and significance. The talk this afternoon, we'll talk about first the past as preparation, how 10 years and larger organizations prepared me for my first entrepreneurial experience. The early journey as an entrepreneur, with primary focus on a company called Uracor, as well as some experience with a group by form called Alpha Bio Partners. And I want to talk about what we're doing now, a company called Crescendo BioScience, which Tom alluded to. And then talk about lessons learned at each stage of the way. Let's begin with the past as preparation. I started with a company called Bechtend Dickinson, a billion dollar diagnostics and medical device company. I had the good fortune of joining a smaller division that had been recently acquired by the corporation. It specialized in the field of electrocardiography, where EKG carts would place in all different sizes and types of institution. And behind that, there was a pull through of consumable products, as well as we offer computer interpretation of EKGs. I had the opportunity initially to build sales administration group to look at order processing, tracking, forecasting capabilities. And with that task behind me begged for the opportunity to go into the marketing department to work on consumables and supplies. And there, my first really interesting opportunity was to work on something that sounds very simple. It was a patient cable. How does a cable hook up to an EKG instrument and give accurate recordings? Here's what we found. We went out and worked with texts that interacted with patients. When they put the block on a patient, they immediately flinched because it was cold. So maybe there was an opportunity to do something about that. All the wires came out of one end of the block. But yet, they were all going to be placed different parts of the body anatomically. So maybe we could realign how that happened. The texts were always dealing with tangled up cords. So maybe something could be done about that. Those kinds of observations, that kind of interaction, left the real influence on me as we redesigned things like that cable. And then we went to work on things like EKG carts. The company had previously put a really high-powered design firm in place. The style was fantastic, but the problem was the issue was like the EKG carts didn't fit between beds in the hospital. Or when you tried to wheel them into an elevator, the wheels got caught because they were too small with the crevice involved. So a lot of time was spent with a white text jacket meeting with EKG text all across the country learning what worked, what didn't work, what they wanted to accomplish. That led to a real sense of how do you think about new product design? How do you think about innovation? And this was an opportunity that I had at a very early stage in my career to which I was very grateful. The next was being able to be trained in the Becken-Dickinson program, which was focused on strategic management and planning, where we learned a lot about how you analyze markets, how you think about relative competitive position, positioning, and a host of other things that would be important. A fantastic early start to the career, thoroughly enjoyed it, but I was recruited next by a company called American Hospital Supply. It's a company that was acquired in 1985, so it doesn't exist today in its current form. But back then it was an amazing place to start your career. It took young, aggressive talent and trained you extraordinarily well, the best of academic programs. But then you made the decision, you made the call, you had P&L responsibility typically very early in your career. It was an organization that was growing 30 to 40 percent per year, so it wasn't uncommon that you were in a different position every six months, every 12 months, every 18 months. It was an environment that either people did really well in or they tended to wash out in, but it was the ultimate meritocracy and it was a great place to invest time. We had an opportunity to launch several lines of what are called hematology analyzers. They do complete blood counts, looking at things like red blood cells, white blood cells, et cetera. Also have opportunities to do some other very interesting things, including work on my first turnaround on the product line level. The company launched a series of instruments, there were $125,000 instruments, sold 75, 25 were on their way back based on performance issues. I was in Boston at the time as a region sales manager, but the company called me and asked if I consider coming back to Chicago based on what launch experience we had in the hematology line early on. It was a really interesting assignment because it afforded us the opportunity to get really close, really fast to issues or issues that weren't really that clear to start with. There were symptoms, there were vague areas of dissatisfaction. We looked at every placement in the country, all 75, we looked at which ones we would call red, which ones were yellow, and we deployed somebody to visit with every one of those accounts, express our dissatisfaction that they weren't happy with the purchase, try to better understand what were the issues, what were the root causes, and within a period of about two months we were able to dissect about eight different issues that needed to be remedied really quickly to be able to bring that product line further forward. As it ends up, we kept all about one of those 25 sites and systems and it was a great experience in communicating, digging deep, reaching conclusions but reaching them not too quickly. A few years later I had a second opportunity to be involved in a turnaround and this was in that hematology venture where some issues had come to play and senior management was looking at shutting down the enterprise. With another colleague, we argued the case for how we could do some things in the near time term to turn around the performance, put it on a solid footing for the future in the long term. It was a very interesting meeting as I recall with the division president and a couple of executive vice presidents. They listened to our passionate appeal and our 20 slides or so and then with no comment excuse us. About 15 minutes later I was asked back in the room and in the category of being careful what you wish for, they said we're going to give it a shot. You got six months, you run it full time. If it's successful you keep running it, if it's not there's no guarantees for your future. It was a fantastic opportunity, one I'll never forget. We worked every single part of the P&L, we looked at every different way that we could generate increased earnings and top line performance in that business. There's a lot of things that we had to do in that time period but the bottom line on the bottom line was we were able to get it through break even to profitability in six months. Within 12 months it was to double the division operating margin. It was a great opportunity. Along the way we became part of the backster organization, totally different cultures they acquired in American in 1985. So those of us that were used to highly decentralized, this was an organization which was much more centralized, command and control and to some extent frustrating if you wanted to make the call move things further forward. While following the experience I had in running that business unit for a couple of years, we had the opportunity to assume that VP of marketing position for the scientific products division. That was a discussion that I just went through a few minutes ago that led to my ultimate leaving the organization. I want to share some thoughts about lessons learned in those first two or three company experiences. So at Beckton as well as American hospital supply and at backster. Early in the career what were the things that we tried to focus on, things that seemed to matter make a difference as it relates to preparing me to jump out into the entrepreneurial world. The first one was take initiative so we didn't play it safe. Were there were challenges, were there issues, were there things that failed or were people didn't want to pick it up. We love picking up those kinds of assignments. And there was always the risk of failure but there was always the prospect of success as well. So that was one of the things that was very important to me. The next was just get in the field, learn first hand what's really going on with customers. How are they thinking, how are they processing information. There's something called intense observation where you're really trying to discern what they're trying to accomplish is a different or better way to accomplish that. And how things really work, map them, analyze them, develop the models. I remember near the end of my Beckton experience I had taken a room of my apartment and turned it into a war room. It was nothing but flip charts, strings and other ways of mapping through different issues to try to figure out how something was done today, how might it be done in the future. So a little intense but this is something that I really believed in and served me well over a period of time. The other one was problem solving skills. Always, always important. And there's so many different ways to attack a problem, to think about how to come out the other side, think about criteria, waiting, what's important, who's perspective. But being known as effective problem solver is really important. Taking into account the idea of others, synthesizing, moving those forward in a very productive fashion, always being known as someone who's trying to pursue the best possible answer, not looking at individual agendas or what's best for one group or one department or another. It matters over the long term. Broadening the experience base, the things that were important to me is I learn the strategy side, the marketing side, sales, do something about being in front of a customer. And when you think as a strategist or a marketer that this plus this should equal this, you find out in front of a customer that often isn't the case. So broadening the responsibilities, thinking strategically always, but then delivering tactically consistently. And then a point I'm a really big believer in, which is just tenacity and the difference between success and failure is often in the last 10% of effort. So things learned in the larger company experience that allowed me to move to the next phase. Let me go to that next phase. The early journey is an entrepreneur. The company you're a core was a venture backed company based on a check transfer out of the University of Oklahoma. The goal was that this technology would allow physicians to be able to not only detect bladder cancer but a wide range of cancers. But the company had missed all their product development milestones, market development milestones, financial milestones, and had terminated the founder's CEO and was involved in three sets of litigation. So the board was looking for a CEO to come in, quickly determine what's the lay of the land, what's the path forward. This was no doubt to be a challenging assignment. And thus far there were no takers. We took the plunge and what an interesting challenge it was. What we thought was interesting was the opportunity to build a company, to look at a field like cancer where there were clearly a wide range of unmet medical needs. And the fact that it was a turnaround wasn't necessarily a negative to me given that we had had experience in a couple of other areas where that was kind of an exciting aspect to be probed or pursued as well. The first thing we did was evaluate the technology and we found that it wasn't something you could build a company round. So now what? The company had nine months of cash remaining. It was a technology-based company that didn't have a technology. So we began an intensive analysis about what could we do? What could we build? So we looked at markets, we looked at physician types, we looked at unmet medical needs. We started in the field of urology because the company had started in the field of bladder cancer. We found some really interesting things. This clinician was trained as a diagnostician and a surgeon and an oncologist. So when you think about certain cancer types, there was continuity of care between a physician and a patient. Next, they had really specific goals at every stage along the way. They wanted to detect cancer, diagnose it, prognosis, determine if they should perform surgery or deliver therapy, monitor the effect and then look for long-term evidence of cure or recurrence. They accessed services from disparate sources. So to each of those goals I just mentioned, they make one of those accomplished by going to local hospital and another case to local pathologists and another case to a regional side of pathologists. And nobody was bringing all this information together. Nobody was focused on delivering levels of service or quality or advanced information that could conceivably be brought forward. It was a finite audience, 7,500 docs, so manageable to access. These docs made their own decision on what services they accessed, interesting. And we went through a large stack of publications on advancing technology in the field and we found there were some really interesting things going on at a number of academic medical centers. But here's what we decided. We were going to build a business focused on the urologist as a specialty, look at a range of diseases and with the goal of working with a physician through every step of the disease process, bringing forward the best of existing technology and then augmenting it or supplementing it with the best of advanced technologies that we would license from leading academic centers. Well that was the strategy and it got unanimous buying from our investors as well as the board. So we began the execution phase, recruited a new management team that could execute that vision, build the services platform, build a laboratory at the same time. This took about another six months. While making progress behind the scenes litigation was advancing and had unfavorable outcome to the company. We had a long discussion with the board and our investors and the consensus was winning strategy, teams in place, first products launched, first customers secured, but very difficult to fund the company to the next level until the question of legal overhang was resolved. We chose to address this collectively via financial reorganization, address the issues, recapitalize the company. Well this is not without risk and so we thought about what happens to your customers, what happens to your employees, what happens on a whole range of fronts if you put a company into a chapter 11 reorganization. So we thought about each of those areas. We put a simultaneous petition of reorganization and plan of organization in place and then we just worked really, really hard to come out the other end. But in 120 days we were able to settle all claims, recapitalize the company, we retained 100% of our employee base and we effectively grew our customer base by 30%. We are now on an unencumbered path to grow the business. The phases we next looked after the company after the turnaround phase was emerging growth and then advanced services platforms. So for the emerging growth phase with basic capabilities in place what we now looked at was how do we deploy ever more reps into the field, get access to more and more physicians, more physicians means access to more patients and how do we drive more products in. So it was really executing against the growth model for the company. And then in the area of advanced platforms we really, really wanted to make a difference with patient outcomes. So one of the projects we pursued was something we affectionately called the scroll. It was a diagram of the disease like prostate cancer. We looked at how it unfolded over a period of years. What were all the branching points, what were the decision nodes. And then we looked at what was important to a patient, through their process, what was important to a physician, what was important to a payer. And it was by each stage from initial detection all the way through ultimately what might happen to a prostate cancer patient. So we focused on that document. Month after month after month as we built the company, where can we innovate, where can we add new products, where can we add services that would be a value to our customer base. We complemented that process with a program where twice a year every manager, every member of the senior and middle management team would spend a day with customers. It was a great experience and we spent the time looking at what were we doing currently, what was their business relationship like, what could we do additionally that would be a value to clients. And the day coming back and the thinking through further what were next steps and what we could do were profound. We learned for example that reports that we provided the physicians, which were really graphical. They might show here's a diagram of the prostate, here are the regions of the prostate, here's where cancer was found, here's a photo micrograph of what the cancer cells of tissue looked like. It was a bibliography to tie to the literature base of similar type cases, very information rich. Well they were sharing those reports with their patients. So we said, well why don't we develop a second page of the report that's written in patient language that you can share. It was a tremendous advancement and I'll never forget one of our top physicians said, your reports make me look brilliant in front of my patients. They absolutely love the care and attention that they get and the specificity. So examples of listening to your customer and thinking carefully about the disease and where you can leave or a difference. Far too fast forward over the next several years in that business, we grew from 10 to over 400 employees. We provided services ultimately to 40% of all your relatives in the United States. We were in 500 company in 1992, 93, 94, 95 for growth rate. And we transitioned from four rounds of private capital to public company in 1996. Great learning experience, absolutely loved it, incredible journey. But I thought I would do that for maybe five years, five years become six years, become seven years, maybe close to eight years. I had the feeling that I wanted to do something new, something different. And there was also this constant assessing of one skills, their contribution, what impact they could have on the organization. There is something very distinct in the context of company life cycles. And where are you in that overall process? And as the business grew through $50 million, and there was a lot of focus on systems, processes, controls versus some of the things that I was much more interested in. There was this great article in the magazine that caught my attention from serial entrepreneur. And it said, there comes a time when you realize the business needs something, you can't give it. At the same time, you need something the business can't give you. Maybe it's that energy, maybe it's what it was like at the time of the startup. But in any event, to me, it spoke loudly to, I want to be transitioning on to the next thing. And that meant putting a plan into place such that within 12 or so months, I could leave, I could move on. And so exactly 10 years to the day when I walked through the door of my first entrepreneurial experience, I announced I was leaving. And reflecting back on that company experience for 10 years, there's a lot of things to think back on. There's a lot of things to maybe be proud of. But I think the things that were most impactful were, we believe we helped transform a field by providing more insightful tools and capabilities to physicians to improve patient outcomes. And as a result of that, there may be patients alive today that wouldn't otherwise be. And to me, this was a cause. This was a crusade we're signing on to. So let me take a couple minutes to talk about things learned in that first 10 years as an entrepreneur. So there are things we learned in big companies. And you'll see really different things when we talk about this slide. And you'll see really different things when I get to my third slide later. It's this integration of the strategy, how it ties to a business model, the efficiency of the business model, what your growth metrics are and financials. They've got to be ultimately extraordinarily integrated and all work together to spell success. There's great complexity in these fields where you've got clinical or medical dimensions and considerations with advanced scientific insight, biology, let's say at work in patients, and then a wide range of technical dimensions that come into play. And it's especially critical for the CEO to understand what are these concepts and how these concepts integrate. You can't just delegate these things. You've got to have a pretty good understanding at your level. There's this extreme need for multitasking. Unlike anything I saw in the larger company experience, I've got my big three, four, five priorities for the year maybe and a big company and staff of 80 people. So here we're a group of eight to ten people and there's an amazing range of things that have to be happening. And if any one of those fall down, it might mean death of the company. And at the same time, there's very limited margin for error. So you've got to be right on almost all the decisions that you make. Similarly, when you were really under the gun as we were 60 days to find whether there's a business here where we should shut down because the technology didn't get us there. The importance of culture, focus on patience is something really, really important. There's all kinds of things you can try to gear people towards. And they can range from, we're going to build a company, we're going to take it public and people are going to make a lot of money. To me that doesn't cut it. The fact that we're going to build a company that's going to change a field and we're going to improve patient outcomes and survival, that's something to sign on to. And in fact, I recall that the deciding factor for me in hiring the chief medical officer I did was this was a person who lost his father and his mother to cancer. So it was personal, it mattered to him. We had a lot of people like that. Power of team interactions, collaborative impact, removing barriers along the way. This is great exercise we did one time. We had about 20 of us sitting around a room and each of us were given 21 questions to solve or problems to solve. Nobody got more than 10 or 12 right. We then broke into teams. No one team got more than 18 right. It wasn't until we all got together, we got 21 right. These were some of the brightest people, MDs, PhDs, MBAs and otherwise. But unless we let our barriers down and really work together collectively, we wouldn't get as far as we could. Leadership needs to be acted out and not just talked about. This was a lesson I learned really after the fact. We went through those dark times of putting a company through a financial reorganization and I commented that not a single person left in that period. I didn't know until later when somebody told me because you are confident because you didn't waver, we didn't leave. So that was something you had to act on because you really, really believed it wasn't something you could just talk about. The importance of vision for the long term balanced with deliverables. This was something I had to learn on more than one occasion. I love vision in the strategy side of things. If you don't have a vision, you don't really have a future. But if you don't deliver in the near term, you never get a chance to live out the vision. And then this understanding of company life cycles, different things need to be in place at different stages. You'll recruit certain people. At some stages you won't get other stages or some people want to leave once it gets to a certain stage. So understanding that's important. So to the path of the current is I'm running tighter on time than I thought. I'm going to skip one section and then go right to more recent. So about four or five years ago with a colleague, I formed a group called AlphaBow Partners. And our goal is to look at promising science and technology, really early stage science and technology, and try to decide which of those had a promising commercial pathway. We would do a really large body of work. We would look at markets, we look at existing products, we look at technology, waves, we would look at additional perfect concept studies that were necessary. If it was a drug, what kind of studies we required to get it to an IND stage, what kind of clinical trials would be required. If it was a drug compound, what would it take to make it? How much was it likely to cost to make it at scale? What would be human dosing? What would be cost of goods? What would pricing look like? Just a wide range of things with the idea to make companies that we would ultimately form as strong as possible by answering the right questions upfront as opposed to learning about things further downstream, which we would have seen time after time after time. So we had the opportunity to work on things and end of microbials as well as diseases like ulcerative clays and Crohn's disease. But the company I'm running right now, Crescendo Biosciences, came out of that effort as well. And that's where I'd like to spend the next little while. The founding scientists spent five years at the National Institutes of Health, Arthritis Branch, very knowledgeable disease pathology, biomarker technology applications, was at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, which is a powerhouse and auto-immunity we met. Mike was passionate about his desire to transform that knowledge, that insight, those biomarker insights into products that would make a difference with patients. And for him, it was personal. Mike's an autoimmune patient, pro-an autoimmune family. So what we do matters. So success has measured a little bit differently. So again, when I would think about what was something I'd be willing to sign on to that really would make a difference. Mike's approach, Mike's commitment mattered to me. After about 12 months of work, this kind of exhausted process that I went through, we showed the company to three VCs here in the Bay Area. And we're pleased that three of them liked the deal and worked the deal. And while three were working the deal, more David, our MDV was really fast, first meeting the term sheet in eight weeks, great negotiation on terms. The only two that were particularly interesting to talk about were that I would do this full time, and we would put the company here in the Bay Area. So those were kind of interesting considerations. But I loved the opportunity, and the more I kept looking at the opportunity, peeling through it, the market, the opportunity, the unmet need, the more we really, really wanted to be involved. And the fact that Mike would be a key part of that as well on the science side was a real positive. So we closed the series A in early 2007. Mid 2008, we closed series B, and that was led by Clienter Perkins. So great, a couple of investors, both really experienced molecular diagnostics and personalized medicine, which is the field that we're in. So I'd like to talk you through a few points of what we're up to. These are some things that Anna Roggan others had an opportunity to see when they came by the company. So we'd be considered in the field of molecular diagnostics. We're solely focused in the field of room etiology, and you're going to see some parallels to some other things. In fact, when I met Michael Goldberg from MDV, I said, here's what we want to do. We want to take the best of what we learned in a specialty-specific play where we got to understand the diseases really well, combine it with the best of what we've seen with technology-driven companies on the molecular diagnostics side, and bring those together. So auto-mune and inflammatory diseases are a wide range of those, but the ones that will one will focus on initially, rheumatoid arthritis. We'll be technology agnostic. We're trying to solve a problem. What need does that physician have at a given point in time in managing a patient? So we have several forms of technology that we're working with, and then we'll build a technical specialist organization. We'll call directly on rheumatologists all across the country. We'll deliver our products as a service. So a doc has a patient in their office. He has a serum specimen. Send it to us. We do an analysis. We send back a test result. So the area that we focus on, rheumatoid arthritis, 500 individuals per day are given a diagnosis of RA. There's 1.4 million patients with this disease. This isn't regular arthritis. This is rheumatoid arthritis. It's an auto-mune disease. The body's attacking itself. It's a disease marked by systemic, long-standing inflammation with a company damage, and most frequently erosions that lead to structural damage and disability. Verotify patients 10 years after diagnosis of RA or out of the workforce. It affects the population. It's 75% female, and average age of onset's 47. Inter-significant comorbidities, cardiovascular disease, and complications among others. So to that opportunity, what are the tools? They're pretty terrible. They're non-specific. They don't provide insight as to what's happening with the biology. They're really more based on signs and symptoms. If this really wants to know, what's happening with that inflammation is the patient heading towards clinical remission. What's happening with erosions and joints-based nearing is that patient heading towards radiographic remission. And because the tools are so insensitive and inadequate, you get back to this age-old statement. You cannot manage that, which you cannot measure. So what's our solution? You want to transform the field by turning the lights on at the individual patient level to reveal their underlying disease biology. And we'll do that by integrating a large number of biomarkers with algorithms that tell physician more what's going on with the patient. It's clear that a disease as complex as this one biomarker, two biomarkers, whatever won't provide the answer. And as we do that, we can deliver quantitative objective reproducible tools and tell a physician more what's going with disease activity, trajectory, erosions, et cetera. Another mind-boggling aspect about this marketplace is that there are over $6 billion worth of biological therapies being used on these patients. And no doc would say that they have a tool that tells them which patient, which drug, which dose, is 12 months of trial and error. So the opportunity is we see it. Look at multiple products over a period of time that can be delivered for that physician to access to dial in what's going on with the patient. Get them in a clinical mission, get them into radiographic remission. To do that, we have some really efficient ways of screening through massive numbers of biomarkers determining which ones have utility, which ones provide the most information as we go forward. There's a lot of computational capability. There's a very strong bioinformatic suspect in all of what we do. And biology modeling is very important as well, and thinking about clinical pathway models, which is something that we had a very special project to work on recently. So for us, it's not just about delivering a product. We want to understand the biology today and longstanding. We understand what's happening clinically with patients. And how can we gather more and more information and present that back to the field? So the business itself is extremely efficient. You call on 3,500 docs that manage 1.4 million patients that are being seen up to four times per year. It's highly-laveraged, very effective business model. So that's a little bit about what we're doing. Echrochina bioscience today. So lessons learned. Now is the serial entrepreneur. So this gets a little longer to a little bit more dense back as we go forward. So this was a really interesting preparation for this talk because some of these things had really focused on as much, but they're really interesting. So now how you think about these things, you architect it much more deeply up front. You think more about all the variables that come into play. How you're going to have them all linked together, this market to model, to financial, to capital formation, to capital efficiency, there's a lot more thinking you do before you actually start acting or executing. And you think about how can that model be even tighter, even more efficient as you move further forward. And you think about risk a lot. Risk is a good thing to think about. A lot of people have the perception that entrepreneurship is all about taking risk. In actuality it's about how to minimize the risk. You do that by thinking ahead, having really smart people going through your work two or three times. So it's looking at risk early where it's going to come up midstream, where it's going to come up late, redundancy, reflexive pathways, etc. Really, really important. And the culture still focused on the patient. The patient matters, the physician matters. That's what we're really here for. And then thinking in terms of excellence, we did a survey on our culture recently. And there was a great statement somebody made that said, everybody in this company thinks like a scientist, even if they're not. We have people in a commercial group, advanced statistical analysis, and how they think about market penetration models, and so many other parts of the organization I can go on. But it's thinking about the best techniques, the best approaches to get me brought to bear. Collaboration, best idea, bias towards new approaches and innovation. And then even more, the focus on talent, A plus talent, who's been through the drill before. And I really like the one of who's lived through new paradigms. We're dealing in the field of medicine when you're trying to change physician behavior, doing something different. It's great to do that with people that have been through one paradigm, two paradigms, three paradigms. Because this is where companies oftentimes fail. The other thing is we think much more now about not just the top level of the organization, but two levels and depth and breadth being really well addressed as early as possible. Leadership that's more based on direction and empowerment. So there's different leadership models, so-called level four, level five, serve at leadership, transformational leadership. So I think about those things differently now than I did back when I was just trying to fight my way, to live another day, and building a company like your core where it looked like, there might not even be a tomorrow. So thinking about leadership differently. Programs, they're broader with greater impact in multiple waves. The architect more, you muscle build it more talent, and then your programs are stouter by way of what you're advancing simultaneously so that you have greater impact. You have multiple waves right behind it. And not just being able to synthesize some of those I described before, clinically, scientifically, at all levels of the organization, but it's building a cadre of experts, three, five, seven, or more in each area that's going to be important to you. And the last thing, it seemed pretty obvious, but building enough time to think, to reflect, to not have things moving so quickly that you're missing important opportunities as they're moving forward. So a full talk, a long talk. My goal has been to fold really, to describe the journey of an entrepreneur through multiple stages, large companies, first time through the cycle, second time through the cycle, on a full time deal. And I wanted to emphasize as we go forward that what you focus on, how you approach it matters. Thinking about more than just signing on to something, but signing on to something that's important, something that's a cause, something to compete to find as a crusade makes a difference. So with that, I'll say thank you, and I'll open it up to questions. So William, thank you for coming. And as some of you know, I'm Steve Blank. I teach the MSNE278 class, the spirit of entrepreneurship, that surrounds the ETL lectures. And our class gets to ask the first couple of questions, and we're lucky today. Tell us how a volume is going to be able to join us in our classroom as well. So William, the first question that just kind of struck me as you were kind of going through your history, can you think back to the day you realized you were an entrepreneur? Was there like a light bulb? That's a great question. So that first line of hematology systems I had the chance to launch was from a venture back company in Mountain View. And I was in Chicago at the time. And the interacting with the management team and just the rush of what was going on there and the pace of the intensity, I was definitely intrigued. So was it an endorphin activity? It's hard to fully describe, but endorphin was certainly part of it as well. I just love the making things happen, making them happen quickly, and a really efficient process. And you know, bigger companies have their own kind of plotting aspects to them. Great. Last question I'm going to get wrong because I'm not a biotech kind of guy. I'm a computer hardware guy. But to me diagnostics sounds different than a therapeutic drug like a cancer cure. Is there a major difference on how you interact with the FDA for something that's a diagnostic versus something that will go in your body? And if so, what's the short version of? Yeah, it's very different. There is definitely a long version. But the short version, if you're dealing with a drug, there's a pre-IND package. That needs to be submitted. What's an IND? Investigational new drug application. So the IND goes on. It allows you to do phase one testing, which is looking at safety. So it's a drug safe. Next thing you're doing is looking at first test of efficacy. That's phase two. And then you're powering up further to phase three's to test efficacy at a higher level. That can be a very long process. It can take somewhere between five and ten years depending on the drug. What's the end point? And a whole host of other things. The diagnostics, it can be much quicker. There's something called the 510K process where you show substantial equivalence to something else that's out there. And you might be through the overall cycle in 90 to 120 days. Conversely, if it's something brand new, you might have to go through a PMA pre-market authorization and that can take one to two years. So there are very different paths, very different parts of the agency with a lot of different considerations. Well, thank you. And so with that, I'll open it up to the class and the audience. And you could just take questions from people who have them. You're correct. We are interacting with the doctors and getting their feedback on these new diagnostics. Did you find it difficult for them to take care of gene methodologies, like teaching and old-time metrics, or are they very willing to change up how they've been trained through diagnostics and oncology? Great question. And so in the question was, when you're looking at new tests for doctors, do they accept them, or do they sometimes have some skepticism? And it really varies by specialty. One of the things we loved about rheumatology was the specialty was so open to new approaches and that the field was so far behind others. And they had to rely so much on Gestalt as opposed to having specific tools. We just found it to be a wide open audience, willing to collaborate, willing to look at new ideas. And that's generally not the case. That's the exception. Yes. So I signed here bio that your degree is actually a business management. That's right. I'm wondering how did you learn all this tech bio stuff? Just brute force more than anything else. So yeah, I had an undergraduate business management. I wasn't trained in the life sciences, so these clinical scientific and technical aspects. These are just things that we committed to learn in whatever venture we were involved in at a level of proficiency where we could be conversant with scientists or MDs or whatever the case was. Maybe not always something that somebody in a leadership position does. I would have to say I just also really have a passion and a love to learn. So it didn't feel like work a lot of times either. Question? Was there an element in the status quo that felt threatened by your innovations and how did you interface with that? You know, so the question is are some threatened by innovations? And it really depends, I think it's an important part of trying to understand what somebody's trying to accomplish and what can you do for them that takes a little further down the path. For example, in this rheumatology venture, we noted that they were going through these really thick folders. These are patients who have seen many times. And you could kind of see them visually trying to construct different data points in a particular order to get a complete picture. And so if you said to them, would you like a report that characterizes everything that's happened up to now and everything that's going on right now, et cetera, you'd probably get a, wow, that's great based on if you can show how you're trying to maybe solve a problem. If you pushed something on them like a healthcare medical record from the perspective of they do the work to get the benefit, you probably have a very different response. So I also try to find ways where you could help them accomplish something in a way that's painless and might add another twist or two on top of even what they were thinking about. Yeah, I think you're getting another previous question about learning the field. Give me advice for those seeking to get into healthcare business and like moreover, how do you learn what to do better than the actual doctors in the field? So the question is for those that want to get into the medical field, how do you learn it and also how do you learn to do things better than that doctor themselves? That one's a really tricky one. So let me tell you some of what we did. So we first framed rheumatoid arthritis out clinic. We constructed kind of this care and medical practice model with experts in what's called meta extraction from the literature. And then we talked to docs about, you know, when you have a patient right here, you know, what are you doing? What are you thinking? What tools do you have? How do you feel that that needs being satisfied? Do you feel really confident? When you hear things from them like, I need a tool to give me confidence to do such and such, or I need a test to allow me to convince a patient we need to take a particular course of action, you know you're kind of on to something. So we do the one-on-ones to try to tease these things out. We're characterizing a little bit further. Maybe then we'll do focus groups, 10, 15 physicians in a room. We'll boil it down a little bit further, tighten it up. And then we might do quantitative market research. So conduit analysis, so we define certain product attributes, degree of satisfaction, and we try to really nail how you would need to build a product and deliver to them and test it to see if that's something that they would adopt and adopt and what kinds of patients. So it's a variety of steps that we'll maintain. Yes. Yes. I was curious to the specific diagnostic tool. How does this sort of plug into the cost equation? I mean, I know obviously it's going to give a lot more information and a lot more. And I mean, I guess that could lead into some costs. But I was curious how this plays out. It's going to be an added cost. Or is it going to allow you to sort of put doctors offset by not doing a necessary. This is really important to look at. So the question is, are costs additive or how do you look at that in a healthcare system if I kind of paraphrase it? So that's really, really important. So some of the things that we looked at were if you have a patient that's relatively in control at the end of a 24 month time period. And in this disease, 24 months can really help set the trajectory for the long term. A patient that's in control might cost a system only a few thousand dollars per year, longer term. Patient that's not in control, 20, 25, 30,000 plus. So to the extent that you can show that you can move percentage of patients towards control versus lack of control. And then you run some cost effectiveness calculations you can get there. But we do a bit of work on modeling health economics as well as surveying payers for their thoughts and views. It's also interesting in rheumatology that drug cost has gone from zero basically in 2000 to 6 billion currently. And they're struggling with that. So which patients really need, which drug, which dose, etc. It's something they're very desires of better solutions for. Yes. So there's lots of different types of arms, the nerves like both of them what they do in the person they are. Absolutely. What specifically did you do when you were first starting out in companies and how would you characterize yourself as a leader? So how did I get up to speed as an entrepreneur? And I know I think of myself as a leader. So how do I think of myself? There are a number of ways that you can better understand your strengths and your skills. And I would like to have covered that and I didn't. So there are these things like Myers-Briggs. So I study Myers-Briggs and so I'm more of an INTP. So I'm fairly intense, I'm more analytical, I'm more inward. I love to think about a wide range of different possibilities. It's part of my makeup. You can do something called strengths, finders. And so there, I would test high-end vision, strategy, analysis, innovation, and deliberation. So there's a series of things that you can do, but it's really important to know yourself. Because you can't force a style that doesn't work for you. And there is no one size fits all. So I then try to accent the skill and strategy, vision, global thinking, how something might work, how the pieces fit together. I also told them reasonably good at building teams. So I try to focus on building teams with the best possible talent I can. And now it's set direction and empower them and make sure that they have all what they need to be as successful as possible. And of course correct, we're necessary. But knowing yourself, knowing your strengths, knowing your skills, complimenting, really important. I would say it's not just your strengths, it's your passion. There's some things you will just love. I love innovation. So if I'm not given a chance to innovate every now and again, I'm not going to be as happy. There is also that part of Mark is booking him's work that talks about knowing your strengths and how do you live, how do you look at time blocks, and how much of the time are actually living to what you're really good at. And I guess the last thing I'd say is that at a certain point you realize that I may never be good in a particular area. And I could try to keep getting better there, but I might be better off just saying, I need a person that can do that really well because that's their strength. So I can just focus on what I'm best at. Yes. So, a little bit about my question, how are the leadership, you mentioned something like, and your third point, you said leadership based on direction and empowerment, what do you mean by empowerment? Yeah, so early on, I used to get really, really done into the details of things. And so how does this work, this program, this detail, how's it going to work, et cetera. And now I'll be more focused on finding somebody that's as strong or stronger in some of those areas. For example, I have a head of commercial that's absolutely fantastic. So the best thing I can do with Ted is give him my best thoughts and my experiences, I've seen him, and let him synthesize that and integrate it with his strengths, his skills, and his experiences. So that's an example. And if you can build a team where you've got a number of those kinds of individuals, you're really going to be moving fast. One more question. Last question. You talked a lot about talent, how easy was it for like a turning around for a small business to buy talent and how did she overcome this? So the part I didn't mention was that the company we built in Erology was located in Oklahoma. So I have a whole talk kind of on building businesses in a region with industry specific infrastructure, and it's really tough. We had to ultimately bring in 20 MDs, PhDs, and members of senior management team recruited one at a time with relocation recruiting dollars. So it was really difficult. And compounding that was that there was a turnaround. And so you had to really believe in what you were selling as it relates to. This is where we're going. This is what's going to happen. And people will assess whether you're really there or not. And they're going to factor the decision based on that. So your conviction, your passion, your ability to incredibly tell the story is important. It's not to say you don't explain the risks because you've got to explain the risks to people too. They've got to be eyes wide open. So William, thank you very much. You have been listening to the Draper Fisher-Jurvis and entrepreneurial thought leader series.
