 You are listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. It is my sincere pleasure today to introduce Tom Seval, who is the chairman of First Virtual Group, a diversified holding company with interest in commercial real estate, agribusiness, global investment management and philanthropy. Tom was the founder, chairman and chief executive officer at Sebel Systems, which merged with Oracle in January 2006. Prior to being at Sebel, Tom served as the CEO of game technology and also had several leadership positions at Oracle before that. He is the author of three books. One of them is taking care of e-business, next is cyber rules and virtual selling. I think you will be interested to know he has three degrees from University of Illinois in history, an MBA and a PhD in engineering. So without further ado, Tom Seval. Thank you so much. Afternoon everybody. Are there any, I understand there is a Sebel scholar in the room, is that right? This year? This year? What's your name? Lauren. Nice to meet you. Congratulations. All right. Okay. So, my name is Tom Seval and I used to be in the information technology business. So our, I was one of the, my computer scientist from the University of Illinois went to work for a startup company called Oracle Corporation. My work was in relational database theory and the worldwide market for relational database systems at that time was like, you know, zero, maybe, you know, zero. And we are, you know, I had an opportunity interview with these guys at Oracle Corporation. They seemed like bright guys. They're about 40 of them in the world and I went to work with them and turned out that they were bright guys. And so that was quite an experience to work with them. And then we did another company called Game Technology that was about the application of sound, motion, video graphics to computers, which was a new idea in 1990. Believe it or not. I've been in 1992. I got together in 1993. I got together with a number of people. And my partner in that was, was here today, Pat Halleson, I founded a company and that was about the application of information technology and communication technology to the problem of establishing and maintaining basically to the processes of sales marketing and customer service. And that turned out to be a pretty good idea. And that was the enterprise application software company who grew that from 1995. Our revenues were $50,000 in 2000. I think they were about $2 billion. And that was a fast-eating software company in history, even today. And then that merged with Oracle in 2006. And it's still a good company. And I want to talk today about, so in my current life, I'm no longer involved in information technology. I spent a lot of time there. And we have an organization here in Palo Alto called First Virtual Group. It's a holding company, a diverse, valid, holy company. We kind of have a number of arms. We have an investment arm. We have an agribusiness arm. We ship beef to market. We have a real estate arm. And then we do some interesting philanthropic things that we could talk about some time. One of which is the Sebel Scholars, which is very exciting. Another, you take a look out on the web sometimes called the Meth Project. It's a large scale exercising prevention related to methamphetamine, www.methproject.org. Check it out. It's been a fast-eating experience. And Nita Zupas, who I think is here, Nita, are you here? Has been really driving that. I want to talk today, the topic of my talk today is IT, the ET. And it's about, think about that as, you know, information technology to energy technology. And I want to talk about kind of the nature of opportunity and how I think the nature of opportunity is changing. And so I want to look at, you know, the information technology era that we have been living through and quite a what I thought, what I, my thoughts on what drove that and what's happening now. And talk about where I think the opportunity may be in the next couple of decades. Now if we look at the big picture from 1980 to 2000, 1980 seems like ancient history. To some of you guys, it was not that long ago. Okay, but, you know, we look at the overall environment going on in the United States. Certainly we had enormously friendly government policies related to how we dealt with risk. Risk was a business problem, not an enathema. Okay, we're dealing with encouraging innovation, entrepreneurship, broad concepts like broad-based employee ownership. And we had a, I mean, it was a very, very favorable kind of regulatory government environment towards business. We had a very efficient capital market system that resulted in an incredibly fluid flow of capital to innovation. We had a global environment that was characterized by cheap and abundant, virtually seemingly infinitely abundant energy. And all of this took place in the context of an information revolution that was quite phenomenal. And that information revolution, so that drove a market, that information revolution kind of drove a market from 1980 to 2000 that grew at a 17% compound annual growth rate. Okay, you will not find a lot of, you know, go do a Wikipedia on that, okay, and you will not find a lot of markets that grew that fast that long. So it grew from virtually nothing to, you know, over a trillion dollars in that period of time. A market growing at a 17% compound annual growth rate, I mean, all you had to do was show up and not goof it up. Okay, I mean, all ships were rising. I mean, it was crazy. Okay, and it was like 1999, you just can't imagine what it was like. It was, it was something. And can I, what drove it? Now I would argue that this was driven by the transistor, okay, and it was driven by, you know, the, and then miniaturization technology that was probably driven by the space race. Okay, and Intel and Fairchild, okay, and so we all know about Moore's law. And this was the fundamental technology that I think drove this information age, which was a fundamental restructuring of the global economy. Okay, we know about it. So we look at kind of the history of economics, where we went from, you know, kind of agrarian societies and pre-industrial societies, and then we had the industrial revolution. And each of these stages of, you know, we're from, you know, hunter-gatherers to agrarian to pre-, you know, different forms of capital that came the scaricist resource. The most valuable resource. So if we look at a pre-industrial society, you know, the primary, the scaricist resources might have been extractive in nature or agrarian in nature. And an industrial society, the scaricist resources were various forms of capital and equipment. And then there was a guy named Daniel Bale, a sociologist from Harvard, who theorized in 1980 that we were going to enter an era where information technology where the speed and accuracy of information became the scaricist resource. It was a crazy idea in 1980, but he was right, okay? And so now we entered this area where we're called the post-industrial society. You know, after a while, you know, after we got through kind of military and space applications, it all sounds from, you know, some kind of useful things to do with this stuff, okay? And then we used, you know, changed the way that we communicated, changed the way that we entertain ourselves, and it definitely changed business processes. Now there's a drove that, so this interim drove, you know, a series of technologies, you know, from the development, you know, first of the computer in kind of a World War II, almost time frame, and then he had Tom Watson at IBM. You know, he had these computers, he theorized as you will recall, he speculated that the worldwide market for computers would be about 10, okay? And then, you know, we found more useful applications for these things, you know, in, you know, main frame applications in business and defense and industrial applications. And then there was the mini computer and then the computer network, which kind of really came out, I would say first digital equipment, and then three com was a big mover in there, what was his name, Bob? He said, Bob, sorry? Now there's another Bob, two, Bob Medcap, he's a neighbor of mine, Woodside, who kind of, I think he's got the, and invented this thing called the Ethernet that turned out to be pretty useful. And, you know, so then you had the, you know, of the mini computer, the personal computer, the relational database system, enterprise application software, the, you know, and then the internet where we are today. And these were, every one of these were basically total replacement markets, okay? These were not incremental advantages on the last generation. So when you were involved in, you know, in any one of these kind of revolutions and you were calling on a customer, I mean, it was, it wasn't a question if they were going to buy it, and they might not think they were going to buy it. Okay, but you knew they were going to buy it, it was just a question whether it was this year or two years from now. And they were going to buy it or they were going to go out of business, they were going to be non-competitive. So these were entire replacement markets and that in true, that in turn drove a market that grew at 17% compound down, you know, it was very, for two decades. It was a great business. Okay, and the result of that, you know, billions of dollars of value were, were created, you know, for investors and you know, some of the great companies in history were created, you know, the Hewlett Packard's Intel Cisco, you know, some great companies came into existence. And for those of us that had the opportunity to participate in that process, I can tell you it was the professional experience of a lifetime. And it was the incredible inflow of capital and talent and innovation and it was wild. Okay, now, about 1920, excuse me, about the year 2000, this thing hit the skits. Okay, it's been growing at about a 3% compound down in the O'Courth, right, since then, about the rate of growth in the economy. Right, so that's a pretty significant change. And I would suggest to you that way that there is still a lot to do, but I would suggest to you that much of the promise of the post-industrial society has been realized. Okay, we in fact have changed the way people communicate, the way that they do business, the way that they entertain themselves, the way that they, the way that business processes are conducted have been indelibly changed. We have achieved enormous increases in productivity across all of these areas. But it's slowed. Let's look at the investment, the venture investment rate in information technology, which grew very, very rapidly going into the year 2000 and is declined by the average of 1% per year since then. Okay, now I've looked at a lot of these business plans that my colleagues from these companies, my friends, that people I went to graduate school with, that people I worked at these companies, other companies I've been working on, and I would suggest to you that most of what's going on today is not very exciting. Okay, I have yet to see something that suggests a replay in information technology, it is not exciting. Most of these things are bells and whistles and features on these previous generations of technology. Okay, and that, you know, that might be fun and it might be entertaining, but that is not the stuff of which great companies are made. And that is not the stuff of these sorts of growth rates are not the raw material from which, you know, great opportunities arise in my opinion. I think we've done it. Okay, I think this is a mature industry. It was a great accomplishment. I believe this industry will grow at about the rate of growth of the economy. Which for the next three years is not going to be very fast. Okay, now let's look at the big picture in the next 20 years, 2010. What's going on out? 2010 to 230. What are we looking at next? Okay, first of all, breath a breathtaking rate of increase in government regulation. Okay, free markets are bad. Government regulation is good. Okay, this pendulum is heavy, it's big, and it has just started to swing, and it's going to swing for a decade. Okay, but ever the problem for every major social and economic problem we have today is that there wasn't enough regulation. Okay, and so we're going to fix that. Okay, and Barney Frank is going to run the banking system. It's going to be great. Okay, okay, and the auto-zar is going to determine what color, what model, what the poultry, what the propulsion engine is. In every vehicle, they're going to review the plan before it goes to the factory floor. They're going to prove it. We're going to have a very, very, the United States, an unbelievable rise in organized labor. Okay, this is going to, I believe, put a substantial tax on doing business. It's going to make it harder. Risk is not something, risk is something that you're going to have to avoid at all cost. It's going to be, to engage in risk will be, I think, probably in many cases, unlawful. So that's a dynamic. Second dynamic in the next 20 years, almost unbelievable population growth. I'm going to talk about that. That population is aging. Then you have some what's going on there. You have the health care implications of that, the food implications of that, the water implications of that, and then some pretty significant energy implications. So let's look at, remember that curve that we had with the transistor showing Moore's law? And I think that's what really drove opportunity from in the last two decades. I think this is the curve that drives opportunity in the next two decades. This is the fundamental thing that is going to make stuff happen. Okay, now, if we look at the growth in human population and say the first 100,000 years of homo sapiens on the planet, okay, it took to 1750 to get to a billion. Okay. Today we have six and a half. Okay, it's going to nine. Okay, this is not something that we can fix with population control. Or I mean, this is absolutely a done deal. Okay, I mean, this is pretty well. You don't absent global pandemic, nuclear holocaust. You can pretty much take this to the bank. And you know, it's going to present some interesting problems. And it's going to present some pretty interesting opportunities. And I would suggest to you that the opportunities that face us going forward are going to be related to this fact. And so I think the market opportunities that are going to give us the opportunity to give you the opportunity because I'm too old for this. Okay, to change the world, you know, like some people had the opportunity to change the world last time, I'm going to be really related to the country. It's going to be very, it's going to be very fun to mount. Okay, it's not about plastics. It's not if you remember the graduate, okay. It's not about, you know, it's not about information technology. It's not going to be about computers. It's more fun to metal than that. It's going to be about food. It's going to be about water. It's going to be about health care. And it's going to be about energy. Okay, well, we have a, you know, the one you, when you, when you make, when you do your slide presentation in the car out in front of the skilling auditorium, that's why you get typos in the headline. Okay, so I don't recommend that technique. I recommend, when you give this presentation to a little bit more preparation than that please. Let's look at aging in the population. Now, a lot of, a lot of, a lot of people and a lot of companies have done a pretty, you know, it has served them well to look at demographics, huh? You don't like the baby boom. I wash that bubble, kind of work through the continuum. Okay, well, what's, how about this for a demographic? There are 37 million people. We have this aging population around the world. Look at some small numbers like the US. Well, what's the population of the US? About 300 million people, right? 37 million people over 65 years of age. Pretty sick. In 30 years that goes to 65. Okay. And in 2000, it goes to 80. That is a big number, folks. Very interesting implications for healthcare. Very interesting implications for, you know, for, for second homes for oceanfront property for, I think it would be China. Who's been to China? I mean, who's from China? That's it. Only four. Really? Who's from China? Where's your hand? I'm surprised. Who's been to China? I'm telling you what I would do. Okay. When I finished graduate school, I came to Silicon Valley. It took me a little while to get here, but I, you know, this is where I got it. I came to Silicon Valley. And that's where the action was. And, you know, kind of all you need to do is show up, not be asleep, do your job, and you can make a significant contribution. If I were graduating today, I would get on a boat and I would get off in Shanghai. Okay. There's just no question. That's where I would be. I mean, it is just crazy over there. There's a lot going on. These people are. I don't know. How many people have not been to China? You gotta go. I mean, it is just unbelievable the energy and the intellect and the education level and the work ethic. I mean, I went over there with some guy with some very close friends of Pat Mine who founded Sebel Systems with the kind of Bill Edwards, a red engineering, kind of a Dave Schmeier who ran products and got him Ed Abba who then later registered. Ed is the, runs all applications and Oracle Corporation. These are very smart guys. I mean, Ed is an aerospace engineer from Princeton and MIT, David is a computer scientist, a serious computer scientist, out of Carnegie Mellon and then went to HBS. I mean, these are very, very smart guys. After five days in China, we're sitting up having a beer on the top floor of the Four Seasons Hotel in Shanghai. And these guys have slayed dragons their entire career. I mean, they have taken on these unbeatable juggernaut companies and crushed them. Okay, like SAP and Oracle. I mean, there's big companies. And I mean, they don't back down to anything. And these guys are looking out the window in the bar in the Four Seasons Hotel in Shanghai and this one person in the shake is head. He said, our kids are never going to be able to compete with us. I'm telling you. I sat next to Goobing Lynn, who's the president of Qingwai University. Qingwai is the top tech of the university in China, as you know, kind of the MIT. And Stanford, you know, is a pretty competitive place. How many people, how many people get a freshman engineer's are there at Stanford? Tom Reffley? 1,000? 400. 400. Freshman classes, Stanford is probably like 5,000 total? 1,600. And probably they get 15 or 20,000 applications for that? Border of magnitude? More this year. Okay, maybe 25,000? Let's be less air by a factory of two and say it's 30,000, but it's 15 or 20. Which is pretty competitive, right? At Qingwai, they have a freshman class of 3,000. How many applicants do you think they get? 20 and 100? How's 8 million sound? Totally, moldy. I'm telling you. And there were these people who worked 90s a week, 24 hours a day. Sorry for the digression. I'm talking about population. I'm talking about aging. There's a lot of activity over there. China's got a population of 100 million people over 65 years of age. There are some very, very significant problems over there associated with me. I don't think I need security to get out of here, but I don't think there is a healthcare system. Okay? And there are some really interesting issues associated with environmental issues that are tragic. So, 100 million people go over 65 years of age going to a population larger than the United States today over 65 with no healthcare system. Okay? Does that look like a problem? US healthcare system, $2.4 trillion. I think it's about 15, 18% of the GDP growing at the most rapid rate of any sector of the GDP going to, you know, $4 trillion very, very quickly. Very rapidly growing market opportunity. 85% of the healthcare dollar, little to known fact, is spent in the United States in the last year of life. Think about that. There's going to be some troubling issues there. Big, big opportunities in healthcare. What is a rapidly growing market? Let's look at energy. So here's this one. You don't got a logarithmic curve showing population growth on top of that. Let's look at per capita energy consumption. This comes out of a book by the name of the Fundamentals of Renewable Energy by Eldo de Rosa, who is a professor here at Engineering. Is anybody taking his class? I want to take his class. He's a very, very interesting guy. But this is per capita energy consumption going from kind of agrarian societies to pre-industrial societies to industrial society, from burning down on a fire, you know, moving through to the industrial area today, this data appears there of the Nintendo and the iPod. And that's per capita. And you kind of put these two curves on top of each other. And that's pretty rapid growth, huh? And so you look at worldwide energy uses. It goes from about 400 quadrillion quad, quadrillion BTUs of energy to about doubling. And then there are some interesting environmental issues associated with this also that we're going to have to deal with. You kind of look at the math of this. 173,000 terawatts of energy hit the Earth every day. It's solar energy. It's virtually the only source of energy on the planet, okay? Is the Sun, okay? And then there's something called, and I have this right, the albedo of the Earth, okay? Which basically, and this energy is translated into fossil fuels and tides. And wind and all that kind of things that we manifest themselves on the Earth. Okay? And then the albedo of the Earth, this basically, this stuff dissipates back into the atmosphere. And most importantly, beyond the atmosphere every day to maintain a pretty constant temperature over a long period of time. Okay? Now, the problem is, when you throw a bunch of carbon out there, it forms a kind of a down jacket on the edge of the atmosphere. Under that layer of insulation prevents this heat from dissipating. And that's what this climate discussion is all about. And it's getting a little hard to dispute, I think. And it creates, you know, so as the kind of polar caps begin to melt and the ocean begins to boil, you know, it's kind of presents some opportunities for innovation. The, the, so the source of energy is, you know, energy today. It's basically, where do we get our energy in the planet? I mean, outside of France and Japan that has a interesting percentage of nuclear power. Okay? It's all, and by the way, even this nuclear power is not a renewable source. The uranium in it is finite. It gets tapped out pretty fast. But, you know, 85 percent of is what we would call, you know, it's hydrocarbon based, non-renewable energy. And if you look at absolutely, virtually every prediction of energy usage going forward for the next, you know, 50 years, it doesn't change. It's about 85 percent hydrocarbon. And when I was having lunch with Professor Deroza, he basically explained to me, and he would look at the systems that are kind of on the Earth today, you know, in terms of all the infrastructure associated with the delivery of energy. If we had the silver bullet today, I mean, right here, let's say, you know, a thousand pintawatts of energy, you know, that would, you know, that would fuel the nation for, you know, 10 years. It would take 40 years for this to work its way to the marketplace in a meaningful way. So even if the problem were solved, the problem, you know, the issue is of delivery, are very, very significant. Okay, so you have the growth in population, you have the per capita, energy consumption, you have the, you have the dependence on hydrocarbons, you have the carbon issue in the atmosphere, and then you have this thing called peak oil. Is anybody looked at peak oil? Interesting problem. It's, I look at how about dual wick of pedeon, it's this guy, I think, Huber King, Huber, is that right? What's it? Huber King, Huber King, Huber, he was a Royal Dutch shell, wasn't he? Royal Dutch shell in 1959, he came up with this theory that when, they kind of predicted the, you know, the world's known oil reserves and concluded that once you got 50% through the world's known oil reserves, it would take 50 years to tap them out. Okay. And all the data suggests that we made it 50% through about 2006. Okay, and I mean, this is not somebody's crazy theory, this is like Royal Dutch shell. And so if you think this is, you know, so if you made it, it made it, this is true. And I don't think it's crazy science, you know, in about 20 years it's going to create some pretty interesting geopolitical problems. Okay. So what's going on in energy? Buildings. Buildings in the United States consume about 40% of our energy footprint, our energy bill in the United States is on the order of $400 billion annually. Buildings account for 40% of the energy that we consume and about 60% of the particular that goes into the atmosphere. And you kind of look at this energy problem and you know there's kind of a couple approaches to it, you know, why is this drill drill drill idea, which is, you know, I mean, I'm not against that, but you know, the data would suggest that, you know, it's not really going to solve anything in the long run. And then there's this concept of invent, invent, invent. And so I want to talk about two initiatives that we've embarked upon. You know, of the various issues kind of, you know, we kind of got focused on population and then we got focused on energy. And we're now involved in two initiatives. One is philanthropic in nature. And the other is a market response to some of these energy issues that I want to introduce to you related to energy. And the first is this philanthropic, philanthropic effort called the Energy Free Home Foundation. Now there is a rich history in technology of technology prizes fueling innovation. For example, as you may know Charles Lindbergh flew from the United States to Europe to win a $25,000 prize. Okay, it was called the, or TIG prize and a lot of people had competed for it and didn't get there and he got there and it got $25,000 and it drove a lot of innovation. There was another person in the 18th century, the British government was running a Navy and they were going to run an empire and the Navy was important to running the empire and they needed to be able to navigate. And so they held a prize to come up with a piece of technology to enable the determination of longitude. And that technology that was developed was called the chronograph, pretty useful piece of technology. Of course they didn't pay the guy, they stiffed him and he ultimately went bankrupt, but it was still, you know, it was important. And so we have assembled, we have been working with, we've had literally hundreds of scientists working for the last two years and Deb Whitman has been heading up this effort. And we've been working with scientists at, we've assembled a team from Princeton University, California, Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories, Ching-Wall University in Beijing. We've had the climate team from McKinsey and Company out of Copenhagen, Stanford University and then the engineers at the University of Illinois and Urbana, that's why I went to University of Illinois. We're thinking about this problem with this. And what we decided to do after a lot of time and a lot of energy was launch a large-scale global challenge with $20 million in prize money to see if we could fuel a great deal of innovation in a short period of time in the energy and make a significant contribution to the energy dialogue on the scale of the home. And we chose the home because we think it has, you know, that there's something that people can relate to. Okay, it's tractable in scale. It has some emotional content to it. And what we're doing is we're putting together a challenge to see if we can realize the energy free home. Okay? And the energy free home that we are defining as basically a standard typical U.S. house built to U.S. economic utility standards, which are higher than the rest of the world. And or much of the world. Where are the sizes, 2,000 square feet, 3 bedroom, 2 bath? That where the energy footprint is zero. That is the non-renewable energy footprint is zero. So at the end of 365 days, the meter reads zero. And to the extent that you use natural gas, you have to pay that back. It could be grid connected. But to the extent that you use natural gas, you have to pay that back to the, you know, in a form of electrical energy. So it has to meet our utility standards, economic utility standards. You can't sit in the dark and freeze to death. And so far, that's not really at heart, by the way, you could build that house. Any four of us could build that house with today's technology. It would cost about a thousand dollars a square foot, but we could get it done. The hard part is the cost of construction has to be no greater than the cost of conventional construction. How hard is that? It's really, really, really hard. Okay. In order to do this, somebody has to invent polio vaccine. Somebody has to invent the transistor. Okay. There's a net new technology that has to be invented. And so we've assembled this team to administer and adjudicate this challenge. So we have Vince Pore, the Dean of Engineering from Princeton, Shirley Tillman's involved from Princeton, but the president by version of the Chancellor of the University of California of Berkeley, Jim Plummer from Princeton, Joe White, the president of the University of Illinois system, Goubeg-Ling, the president of Chingwa, Gary Pinkis, and his team from McKenzie, Steve Chu, formerly of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories, he's involved. He's on the board. And these people are going to administer this global challenge. And what we're going to do. And so then the other people administering it include Spence Abraham, former Secretary of Energy, Jeff Bingham, Senator from Arizona, Senator McCullesky, from Alaska. Who else? Max Boccus, just Senator Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Well, this is interesting here. Shankar Stastery from the dean of Berkeley, Larry Kramer, who runs the Law School here at Stanford. So I mean, a pretty competent group of people. Art Gensler, one's Gensler, the large-circuitive firm I think in the world. And what we are doing is we have two phases to this challenge. The first is an enabling technology phase, and the second is an integration phase. So in the first phase, we have, I forget how many million dollars of prizes. We haven't yet announced this. We're getting ready to announce it. But basically, five million dollars in prizes for teams of engineers from around the world to compete to develop enabling technologies. So over here, you have a reference home. I mean, the reference home has a set of construction documents and design documents. It has 2,000 square feet, three bedroom, two baths. And I mean, you can see it and you know, hear the plans. And so, and it is built to the top standards from Department of Energy in energy, designed to the top standards in energy efficiency today. So these prizes will be for the invention of net new technologies, net new systems, net new design techniques that will substantially reduce the energy footprint of that reference home. And then we're going to hand out, we're going to recognize those in a big way, feature them on Shanghai at the Expo in 2010. You know, very large internet presence and kind of communicate, you know, these, you know, net new ideas to the world. And the second phase is kind of the design build phase where we are going to encourage teams of design engineers and architects and builders to integrate those technologies in any other technologies that might be available to design a house to those specifications, 2,000 square feet, three bedroom, two baths, zero net energy, no trade off in economic utility, at the end of the 365 days that meet at red zero. Okay, we're going to take those designs, we're going to take the top 10 of those and simulate them. Okay, based upon those that exceed the objective and simulation, we're going to build, building 10 of them, measuring them empirically in real life situations, and then we're going to build 100 home energy free community. Currently, it is targeted to go on the campus of the University of Illinois and Urbana. And if we are able to achieve this objective in a 2012, 2013 timeframe, I would suggest you ladies and gentlemen, the world will never be the same. So it's a very, very exciting, it's a very exciting idea. This actually idea came out of a Seable Scholars Conference that we had at the University of California, Berkeley, in October of 2008. In the first quarter of 2008, we founded the Energy Free Home Foundation, formed the University Partnerships and the Partnership with McKinsey, established the Advisory Board, retained the firms, briefed the political leaders, Swartz-A-Degre, Obama, McCain, the people in the Senate and the Congress, spent a year drafting the rules, briefing congressional staff, American Institute of Architects. Now we're in the process of recruiting corporate partners and getting ready to launch the plan. And we'll launch it this spring, the same day that we briefed the Congress and put together a very significant communication strategy around it. And so if you look at McKinsey's assumption of the penetration of this technology into the retrofit market and the new home market, the effect of this, in a very short period of time, like 15 years to reduce 40 million cars from the effect of equivalent of taking 40 million cars off the road in the United States alone. So it's a very exciting idea. And what does this all about? What do we want to do with the Energy Free? What is this initiative all about? It's about fueling, a lot of innovation from a lot of bright people all around the world to compete in a way that will change the world. Fundamentally change the world, change the energy equation, influence public policy, and change the way buildings are built, buildings are operated in the way that people live in them. The second initiative that we've embarked upon is a market response to climate change. And it's a company that we've now actually founded called C3. Basically, we look at this, you know, kind of a couple of vectors that are going on related to energy related to climate have to do with you. Look at what's going on in the European Union and you look at what's going on in this administration. I think it is highly, highly likely that we are going to have carbon reporting requirements and carbon tracking requirements. You have this thing called cap and trade and whether it's a carbon tax system or it's cap and trade. One of these things, I think the probability of one of these things becoming the law in the European Union in the United States in the next, you know, say, cover many years is highly probable. And this will require, for example, where the, basically the essence of this is, will the cap the carbon emissions of a country or a company at a certain level. And you will, just like you are required to, they report your, you know, income statement, your balance sheet, your changing cash flow quarterly SEC. You're going to be required to submit your documentation of your carbon footprint. Okay, and it will be very expensive. Okay, those of you, anybody remember the Y2K problem? Okay, it was a big deal. It was very expensive. Okay, there's like a Y2K problem that never goes away. Okay, there is an enormously expensive to calculate a report. Okay, and then if you want to build a new factory, a new facility, add a new route, build a new product, you're going to have to calculate the carbon footprint of that and mitigate that, right? So you will have to mitigate it that you will have to have either purchase those carbon credits from somebody else or mitigated them from your own use to have them available. And that's the reality of the future. So if you look at the predictions for the carbon trading market, Pat and I were just the Chicago Climate Exchange last week. I guess about a $3 billion market now going to a $3 trillion market in 2020 as a result of this legislation that's going into effect. So we started thinking about this in the summer of 2008. And we, Pat and I assembled a team. It's kind of a unique collaboration, a very unique way to start a company. And what we did is we basically got called our friends from over the years and got them together to work and think about this problem. And so through the summer, the fall and the winter of 2008, we assembled a team of 40 people who were quite accomplished. Steve Ward is the CIO of IBM and the CEO of Lenovo, Sean Coine was the CIO GE power and the CIO at Toyota, at ABO. He used to run all applications at CIO, now he runs all applications at Oracle. We have people who are chief architected, seeable, chief architected, Oracle, finance people, lawyers, very, very talented people from a group of people from the East Coast, the West Coast, Europe, you name it. And they wrestled with this problem for some months and broke off into work groups to think about business plan, Ecos, partner ecosystem strategy, business model, partner models, and December having delivered, concluded the deliberations that decided to found a company. And the company was called C3 and it's about bringing information technology to energy technology. And the idea behind C3 was to go heads down and build a very, very serious foundation of enterprise application software that would enable organizations to measure, monitor, mitigate and monetize their carbon footprint. It's a very exciting idea. And so in January of 2009 it was founded in February of 2009 it was funded. So we sent on an email on Friday and we had $20 million raised by Sunday. True story. February, that's without any discussion of what the terms were. Okay, it was just, first you send your check and then we tell you what the terms were. It was amazing. Needless to say, there's no institutional money. We formed the Board of Directors, consists of Shankar Sastry, the D.M. Engineer, I get Berkeley, Pat House, Mike McCaffrey, who used to run the Stanford Endowment and I was CEO of McKenna Company, Steve Ward from IBM and I am involved. And so as February we founded it, January we funded it in February, we constituted it in February. The founding team, started for work last Monday. One day, Wednesday, two days ago. And every one of these people has two super bowl ranks in information technology. And by the way, everyone that's also worked for a team has played for a team with a zero for 11 season. And so they've been there. Jeff A.M. was an attorney from the University of Michigan, Peter Lam, one of the chief architects at Oracle Seable, Kevin Nick's, red products at Seable, Jan Ritz from McKinsey and Company, Jan's right here in the front row, Eric Marti, Elizabeth McLaughlin from Seable and other places. And then most importantly, Pat House, who is Pat and I have worked together in a lot of initiatives over 20 years. So that's the story. The objective now is to head down, work with partners, work with companies, and in the next year and a half develop a very comprehensive spot product specification and bring the market, a family of world class products that will enable organizations to measure, monitor, mitigate, monetize their carbon footprint. This is kind of the more's law of our lives. Okay, this chart we're looking at right here. The big picture. Government regulation is going to be the government is going to be your new partner. Get used to it. The population growth is going from a billion to six and a half billion. Now it's going to nine and it's getting old. Particularly getting old in places like Germany and China. Healthcare market is going to go crazy. Energy is a problem. The interesting problem is that I think we will solve in our lives that many of you will solve. You know, I'm beyond this. You will solve in your lives. Well, you will have the opportunity to change the world, to make the world a better place, to build some great organizations and feel like you made a difference. I believe are going to be related to food. You're going to be related to water. You're going to be related to healthcare. And they're going to be related to energy. Ladies and gentlemen, it's my great, great pleasure to have the opportunity to talk with you. I see we have nine minutes left in the clock and I will be happy to answer any questions about this or anything you want to talk about. Yes, sir. What's your name? I'm the text. What do you do here? I vote for a work there. For what do you do? I'm in the business department. The other development. It was a great company. How long did you work there? Yes. All right. I have a question. What kind of the first phase from your switch from IP to TV? Tom, can you repeat the question? The question is, what hurdles did I face from IT to ET? Where there's a big hurdle? I didn't know anything about it. Okay. And when I entered information technology, I mean, I was pretty conversant. I could probably go toe to toe with almost anybody on relational database theory. And so I was pretty conversant. So I would say the big difference was domain expertise. And so I spent the better part of three years just reading textbooks and going to seminars and holding conferences at Northwestern. We had a conference at the right. I brought in some of the foremost experts in the world on water for a conference at Northwestern. I was from the foremost experts in the world for a conference at an energy at Berkeley. Spent time with the people from the guy read everything and tried to develop some familiarity with the domain. And I would say that. And so that was a big, big difference. I would say, honestly, you know, what I know about energy technology is at the, you know, just the most pedestrian of levels. But I have taken three years to try. And so that, that's the hurdle. And yes, sir. Where are you incorporated outside the US? We are not incorporated outside the US, but this will like, I mean, we are in the business of building global companies. And then I'm quite certain that Pat will be building a global company. Yes, sir. What's your name? My name is Andrew. Andrew, what do you do? I'm a freshman. All right. What are you studying? I'm still figuring that out. Okay. Me too. What? What are you doing? What are you doing? So I'm trying to figure out the different pros and cons of a carbon emissions tax versus a capatrate system. And a lot of the costs you talked about of calculating the carbon emissions won't be there with the carbon emissions tax. Isn't that correct? You know, I'm going to defer on that. You know, I'm going to, I'm going to defer on that. I don't have a sufficient expertise to all pine. So rather than getting into an area where I'm not an expert, I'm going to just punt out at it and I'll take your word for it. C3 would do a lot more business. Either way, either way you're going to have to measure it. Either way you're going to have to measure it, either way you're going to have to mitigate it. Okay. And we're not going to actually be the trading for. So the measurement opportunities there and the mitigation opportunities there. And whether there's an exchange opportunity is really, I'll leave that to the people that Chicago Climate Exchange. Yes, sir. What's your name, please? Oh, it doesn't know. And what do you do? After this grass doom. All right. So some of the numbers you're making seem pretty interesting. For instance, you said that IT could grow at 17% over the last 20 years. 20 years. Right. And now it's only going to 3%. Well, slower now. It was 3% by 2 years ago. Right. I think it's probably growing this year, like no growth. But then you talked about healthcare. And you said that it was for your healthcare spending was characterized from, say, 2.4 trillion now to 4 trillion in 20 years. You asked. Right. Sorry. In the US. Okay. So that's less than doubling in 20 years. And so that's about a 3.5% growth rate for less. So, does that, could you come to a bit more in healthcare given that that doesn't seem to be significantly larger than the 3% that you see actually growing it right now? You know, I am again, you know, I think you'll find that the reason that there's so much dialogue about healthcare costs is not because they're not growing at a rapid rate. And this was the US. Okay. Now let's look at China. Okay. Where you have 100 million people going to 300 million. And I think very low healthcare expenditures. I suspect the healthcare expenditures in India aren't that high. Okay. And they're going to go. They're going to go to very rapid rate. So there's, you know, you can verify this more rapidly that I can on the internet in about 10 minutes. But there are some pretty smart people out there that think this is a rapid-grade market. And intuitively, I think it is too. Yes, sir. The comment, my name is Aiton. Aiton, what do you do? A company founder. What kind of what do you do? Global tech research. We're building an intelligent platform to speed innovation. That's a major area. So a quick question I have for you is, you know, areas just don't go away. Can you comment a little bit on the role or the opportunity in IT to be an enabling technology? For these areas? Well, I think that, you know, for what we're doing or what Pat and her team are doing at C3 is incidentally IT. Okay. The fact that it's IT is incidental. But I think that's an area where without IT you can't solve the problem. I think healthcare, I mean, are we going to apply, you know, I mean, are we going to apply information technology to healthcare market to achieve innovation there? You know, bioinformatics, I mean, you think. And, you know, so, you know, so I think that in these areas that it will be enabling and there will be some big opportunities. Yes, sir. My name is Eric. Eric. Where do you do Eric? And investor. All right. So my question is with regards to basically the capital markets in the current time. You said basically the government's going to come in and make it hard to take on risks without them being apart. And, you said, population growth, healthcare, everything else. Where does the money come from when we're already massively in debt? I have no idea. I mean, it's a great question. I mean, the investment, what's the largest investment in the world today? And we want to guess. I think it's a Lazard Ferrer. How about that? Jeffries number two. Jeffries number two. Is it Lazard? I think it's Lazard Ferrer. I mean, this entire business has been disintermediated. Disintermediated. I mean, it's unbelievable. Hi. Hi, my name is Liliana. I'm a sophomore underdraft. And my question is to provide energy and energy to the industry. It seems like one of the main problems is these appointments. So what is your thought about the IT marketing trend? How is that different from the one you're in here? You know, I would have to rely on you. You know, I suspect you are a greater expert on that particular subject than I am. But, you know, I think that this, I mean, if you look at the math of China, and the energy math of China, the growth of the Eccadabag juggernaut in China, and the carbon footprint of China, something tells me that the opportunity in China is going to be bigger than a bed box. Yes, sir. I was wondering regarding the prizes and fuel innovation. Do you consider the ex-priced competitor or have you thought in elaborating with them? I think ex-priced is a great organization. They do some interesting things. I don't think they're a competitor. I mean, they're doing some interesting things in transportation. And they're a great organization and they're friends of ours. But we're going to, we, you know, I decided to do this a little bit differently than they do theirs. Yes, sir. What's your name, please? I'm on the top of the market. What are you doing? I'm on the top of the market. I'm on the top of the market. I'm on the top of the market. All right. So I'm just curious about the prizes that you showed the $20 million in prizes. When you have prizes, you definitely have big, big, big pocket in terms of how much innovation you can fuel from those. But what about the funding of those prizes, right? So how do you actually fund the innovation that needs to happen in the year and stage? Especially when they're talking about products which are capital intensive projects. I think it'll vary. I think, first of all, I think it varies. I think a lot of the resource will just be tapped from universities. You know, it'll be people at Chingwa, Stanford, Berkeley, who are supposed to be doing something else that are using the resources of the university. Okay. It'll be people at GE Power, that's doing the same thing. Some of them will be sanctioned. Some will be venture capitalists financing the effort for an interest in the intellectual property. So I think it'll be the full gamut of, you know, they'll be entrepreneurs in the Midwest. They'll team together and build a new glazing technology or whatever. They'll be, you know, four computer scientists here that will come up with an operating system for a house. And they'll just use university resources to do it. So I think they'll come from all over. All right. Ladies and gentlemen, I fully understand we have reached the end of our presentation. And we're now about to turn it into a pumpkin. And thank you all for the great honor of being able to talk to you. Thank you very much.
