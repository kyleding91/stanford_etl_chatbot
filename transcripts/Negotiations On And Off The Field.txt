If I were a student here, I might be thinking, negotiation, Steve Young, what's going on with that? How does a famous football player negotiate? And so the first question I would just throw out is, as you look back on your career, did you have to negotiate or was negotiation relevant? Or how did that factor in as a football player? You know, when you're younger, you don't really realize how much you really are negotiating in your daily life, whether it really is the great skill. It's the great skill in my marriage. It's the great skill in football. It's the great skill in business. It's the skill. And it's all about people. And it takes them. It's all kinds of elements to it, too. There's all kinds of angles to negotiation in my mind. There's classic negotiations for contracts between an agent and a management. And what are the elements of that negotiation? There's elements of subtle negotiation between me and my teammates, right? Because there's 11 guys on this field together, all different nationality. I mean, not necessarily race and religion, the socioeconomic background, geography, language, I mean, everybody's from everywhere, right? So we're all together. And there's elements of negotiation and getting everyone across the line, both metaphorically and in reality, to get people across the goal line. And as you say that, I just think of a story you told me once. So one thing that an athlete certainly does is negotiate with their agent and through their agent. Your agent fairly famously, at least I'm very became, I think, really famous because of you. Did you guys always have a good working relationship? How did you negotiate with each other? And tell us a couple stories about that. He was just a few years older than me when I first came out of college. He was about 28 and I was 21. So and he just landed a couple of big quarterbacks and he was starting the business. And it was interesting. He had his own tactics about negotiating with management. And they mostly centered around getting people either kind of loose with alcohol and then waiting to the middle of the night and just basically working them into submission about two or three in the morning. We can't stop until this is over. And people, one of the tactics that he used very effectively, he'd call me four in the morning, OK, here's the deal. And I'd write it down and then he'd call me at 5.30. OK, the sun's not up yet, but it's this, and it had gone up, inevitably. And so I won't say that's a great tactic. But he would use his, I would say, stamina to negotiate through endless hours. He would just kind of work. He was a bulldog about it. And I think he basically wore people down and just kind of finally got to a point where they said, and then he also over-prepared. He would put a book together led by another guy named Scott Parker, who was, he's Scott Parker was a guy that loved the gory details. I mean, absolutely would data driven, completely engrossed in just different ways to look at the same player. Like he would cut me up in different ways to compare me with Newt Rockney, to Dan Marino, to Joe Montana, and always made it favorable. He would figure out all these angles to how why this is why Steve Young really relates to in different statistics over than he made a book out of it, a presentation. And so General managers would get this presentation. They're used to like saying, hey, you know, we want our guy. He's better than that. And then he'd go, no, you're staying, he's all, you know, that was the way they used to negotiate. And here it was, they were using that kind of moral high ground of logic. Like here, look at, we're just logically walking through this. Tell me where this doesn't make sense. And he would cover all the loopholes. And because the other guy wasn't as prepared. Certainly there's another way to cut that same data and make me look bad, right? If you can make me look good, he can cut it the other way, make you look bad. But he'd over-prepared to a point where they weren't ready to make me kind of cut it the other way. And it's tough in a negotiation. It all said and say, oh, time out. I need some time to go work through this data. It's like we're in the middle of it. We're in the mix. And so you kind of get swamped that way. So he was always, that's his negotiating tactics. But one thing I learned about him over the years is also just to negotiate between he and I. Because you want people to do a great work for you. And sometimes you pay them, but that's not necessarily what everybody's the most effective way to inspire them to do a great job. Least I'm a love to be in the limelight. He was the lawyer at a Berkeley that loved to be kind of in the mix. And so I learned that in any time that he and I were together, if I would include him in the PB shot, you mean like, move him and send him and we talked together, he was energized. And I knew that that's what he wanted. He wanted to be in the, he did not want me to set apart. So I was on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, you know, what's the goofball sports center? He's on the radio here locally. Sportscaster? No, yeah, sportscaster. What's his name? Channel four. They're not even there to channel anymore. But was it Jimrum? Random. Radnitch, Gary Radnitch. Thank you. You guys know him watch TV. So you know, I'm not from here. So he would be there and that's the question. You'd include him. And so that night on the news, there was Lisa and Greg. And he would just be over the moon. And that's another piece of the puzzle is you really, you have to lose yourself a little bit in negotiation and any kind of negotiation. Let me give you an example. When I first started playing for the 49ers, of course, Joe Montana was the looming figure. Anytime I stepped on the field, whether he was there or they'd been traded or whether it was heard or whatever was, obviously it was a big looming figure. And in many ways, the other guys knew that if things didn't go well, they were not the hook. If Steve Young's on the field, we're off the hook. Because if someone goes wrong, what are they going to say? Well, Joe was not the field. Steve's fault. So human nature is that you're going to, I'm not going to say human nature, but we tend to do the least. We tend to get by, we do the most we can with the least amount of effort. And so especially in football. How can I make myself look good by doing as little as possible? And especially football, because it's counter-tuitive, right to go ramming into people. And really, it's all very intuitive with the fit crowd yelling the cheerleaders and everyone going, you're great. Until the moment you have to go hit somebody. And that's like, I don't know about this anymore. Really, I mean, that's why you watch football. It's really, it's like, everyone talks a big game. And also, when somebody gets hit, it's like, ooh. I'm not a leisure. But so I would run into the huddle there. And now I've got to negotiate my way across with these guys that aren't necessarily inspired to save my job. I have to look good. And all of a sudden, I'm on the field. It's got to happen now. And what do I need to do to make sure that these guys are inspired to go help me? And most of it, I would wear them out with my self-sacrifice. In other words, I never want to show any sign of victimization because any time that you have a reason for something to go wrong, human nature is too expressive. Oh, that didn't go well because all these different reasons. And especially in my case, right? Because everyone's being almost unfair because I'm not Joe Montana. Something goes wrong. I want to give context for it. Well, most normal quarterbacks, this happens. Or you want to give excuses. And so I knew that the second I showed any sign of victimization that I wanted to show a reason why, even if it was right, if I showed any reason why something was going to happen, they would respond negatively. I won them over over time by never cracking to that kind of human nature. I would go home and I'd call my dad, dad, this sucks. I got screwed again. But in front of that, never. And what happened is I gained some respect because I wouldn't do it when the light was on. And so that's part of negotiation, too. I've got to get these guys going. I can't go in there and tell them some ra-ra story. Oh, we're all this together. No, the only way I can do it is really just go to work, keep my mouth shut, and never give an excuse, and take the blame where it was appropriate. So thinking about applying that in the game of football, I mean, one of the worst things that can happen is a quarterback is you throw an interception. And not to focus on some of the negative, but you threw a few. Time that to act out. Well, so that's the great thing about playing along enough that now what happened is the guy who replaced me, there was like, well, Steve would never do that, right? Because you know, and I was like, oh my gosh, this is a come full circle. I can do no wrong. Like when I retired, it's like, oh, you're the greatest. So they don't remember anything negative. But I had 202 interceptions in 13 years. It's a lot. And did you ever? Not that I count. And I remember you telling me after a game this is years ago that you threw an interception, and you know, crowd was coming down, and you think you even got booed. And the next time you came out, the next play you threw another interception. All right, so yeah. So I'm going to bring back painful memories. No, no, no, it's not. I mean, you got to imagine in football, the safest way to play football is kind of ignorantly. Like, don't really look up and see the crowd, and don't really look at the impact that you have in society with football. It's just whether you like it or not sports has a huge impact. And so being a quarterback, you know that you're in the middle of it all. And so like I said, it kind of relates to the previous story about victimization. But as soon as I would throw an interception, which if you don't follow football, that's when the quarterback throws the ball to the other team. And that kind of, you know, I don't know how to liken it to another sport. It's like striking out or, you know, or, I don't know, soccer, kicking one in your own goal. I don't know, maybe I don't know. But it's somewhat similar in the sense that your rest of your teammates have basically said to you, you know, you're the quarterback, do something great. Do something really good with it. We trust you, you know, we think you're pretty good. And so then I thought to the other team, and they have this inevitable moment when they look back at me and say, why did you do that? Right? We trusted you. We're working hard for you. Why would you do that? And so what do you want to do? Now 60,000, 80,000 people watching the game, as Stan mentioned, they're muttering, you know, something, and you know, you hear the kind of, and so there's this moment. When now the lights are on, they turn to me, they say, why did you do that? And so your human nature is, you want to explain it, right? This is like, I meant to do it. Like I didn't drop back and just, okay, I'm going to screw everything up. I can't wait, right? No one, you don't do it on purpose, but there it is in front of everybody. It's like you can't fake it. It happened. And now you want to explain it. And so I would go into these long explanations, you know, of why this horrible thing had happened, you know. A lot of logical things, like, you know, the, we'll see you return the wrong way, which he does sometimes, you know, and then you, you trust him, or you get hit, right, when you get through the ball, or something like that. And I noticed over the years that the guys didn't respond. They would not respond to my kind of explanation of the intervening circumstances that have led to this horrible thing that had happened. What they responded to after trial and error, and that's from the negotiation, too. It's not a science. It's like it, it's trial and error, you know what I mean? It's like, so I was trying different things. When I'd make a mistake, I'd think, okay, what should I do, I fall on the sword, what should I do? And what they wanted to hear was, hey, look, I screwed it up. It was in my hand, and now it's in theirs. So, I messed it up. But, that's only half of the, you know, there's a lot of people running around going, oh, what was me, it's my fault, I'm sorry, it's all me, it's all, that's the easy part in my mind. The hard part is now, we're gonna go fix it. That's what people responded to. I screwed it up, but now let's go to the sidelines, let's get a drink of water, we'll rest up, we'll come back on the field, we'll go down the wind, the game, what are you saying? And I'm gonna lead you to do it. Now everyone got energized. They're like, hey, we're in this together. In fact, they'd go to the sidelines, and they'd go to the coach and say, well, the coach said, what happened? He says, well, I turned the wrong way. Who's like to everyone, it's like, oh, this accountability came rushing into this group of people, and everybody wanted to be accountable, because the guy who screwed it up was ultimately accountable. And so we would go back on the field, and that's what Stan's alluding to. Six times in my whole career, they very next throw, I threw two in a row. And so I don't know if you guys ever made two bonehead mistakes in a row, if you think about it, you think about it, I'd probably have. But I was two in a row, and then what do you do? I guess what the elements of what Stan's trying brings me here for is to give context around business, not negotiations for what you think may be traditionally, but in everything, in sports, in moving like scoring touchdowns or negotiating contracts or anything else, it's the same thing. So here I screwed it up again. What do you do? Turn to him, and say, I tell you what? I screwed it up again. But I'll tell you what, we're gonna go to the sideline, we're gonna drink a water, we're gonna come back on the field, I guarantee you, I won't do it three times in a row, we'll go down and win this game, what are you saying? And so they're a little more doubtful, but they're like, yeah, we still believe, we'll go, we'll go. And luckily I never did three in a row. You know, I never did three. But it was really an interesting kind of process to figure out what guys wanted to hear from the guy that's kind of in charge. And the last thing they wanted to hear was mitigating circumstances and intervening, you know, the mishaps. They wanted ultimate accountability. And in negotiation, and that's what that really is, it's like if you're the head negotiator, you see it, I don't watch it, you apprentice much, but every once in a while, I'll tune in just to make myself wanna throw up, and I'll say to myself, it's the worst, it's the best example of accountability, where everyone gets in the room, they start, you suck, you suck. And it's awful to watch the devolving nature of humanity when they start claiming others. And if you want to win in negotiation, if you win that one in this, for briefly, you might win that one, because everybody can go to Vegas and win for a little while. As soon as later you will lose, and you will lose by not taking ultimate accountability. Well, one of the things, let me just, so that is exactly what I wanted to do with that. And it's a great story. I can imagine, again, if I'm in the students' seats right here, I might say, gee, football, you know, it's really different than what we do, and it's been a great, you know, a lot of my students have been pushing this, you know, getting to their party shoes, care about their feelings, we've been talking about people's identities, kind of soft skills. I remember you telling me stories about some of the characters you've dealt with on your team, there were some pretty, you know, highly paid, large ego, you know, players, and you had to persuade them, right? And so I'm thinking of, you know, big play players and kind of what you might have persuaded them and how you overcame resistance, Well, you got to be careful with soft skills because in quarterbacking those are the heart. That's the place where you can, if you want to be, you know, everyone says, why I want to be champion. I want to be a great player. You know, how great can I be if that's my goal? Well, then you got to be with great people because there's no way a great quarterback's ever going to do anything without a great team. I mean, no one ever says, you know, losing quarterback, he's super, team stinks, but he's super. You know, we're in this together. And so when you really talk about those soft skills about kind of, you know, understanding each other, other person, to me, the element, an off-call it love or respect or, you know, getting to know somebody, I used to joke with Jerry Rice's wife, Jackie, that I knew him better than she did. And she's like, oh, come off, that's stupid. You know, Jackie, I've seen him under pressure. I see him when he's tired. I see him when he wants to quit. I mean, I see him on all these kind of extended places. Now, she'd say, well, that's not true. It's probably right. I did it for effect for Jerry to make Jerry appreciate his quarterback. But because that's part of it, too. You want Jerry, because you want people, because every weekend you get into a football game, especially in the road in front of 80, 90,000 people, and the noise alone is enough to make you crazy. And then, you know, you get tired, you make mistakes, you get behind, and you know, it's just human nature as I want to quit. I just can't wait to get to the bus. You start smelling the fumes of the bus like it's this beautiful aroma. You know, you're like, oh, I just want to get to the bus so I can get out of here. And that's when you really know the guys around you. And you have to, as a quarterback, use those soft skills to make sure that individually, you can start to corral your guys. I mean, it's like, Jerry Rice, you can't. You had to be very careful about how you got him motivated. He was super motivated. But you almost, it had to be his idea to be motivated. You couldn't say to Jerry, Dan Jerry, you son of a, you better be know, he would, he would bristle. He'd be like, hey, you can't make me. You know, he's demand resistant, like probably most people in this building. You know, you look, you can't, but if you can make him look at it in a way that inspired him. Oh, he was like a rocket. You know, if you said something that, you know, one of my great tactics is the guy, I was over here in the guy in the third groan. He says that you're, you know, you've never been good since you were in college. You've been overrated. He'd be like, you know, what? And then, you know, other guys like, Terrell Owens comes to mind who played, I played three years with, now, you know, he's world famous for his different antics. But when I played with him, he was very, yes or no sir, want to be a great football player, wanted to work extra hard. We got into a playoff game where he dropped a bunch of passes, a young kid in a big football game, dropping passes and he came to me. Please, please don't give up on me. Please. You know, because he's saying himself, here's this old quarterback, you know, veteran guy, he knows better than, I'm not going to put up with that. Guys going to drop passes in the biggest game. I'm not, you know, it's like, you know, fool me once, shame on you. That was the Dan Quil thing, wouldn't it when he messed that one up? And George Bush's father. Potato. Potato to motto? Potato to motto? Yeah. I need perfect politician. It could be your future career. Yeah. So, you know, he knew better. But what I told him is, first of all, because he's the kid, it was young and impressionable and wanted to do really well. And I said, look, you are the best football player here. You know, most talented, strongest. You know, I'm looking for guys that can get open on third down in the tough situations. That's you. You're my guy. I'm throwing you the ball. If you're open, I'm throwing you the ball. Not to make your big head, Terrell, but if my mom was open, I throw it to her. You know what I mean? But you're going to get open and you're going to get the football. Okay, okay. So, how do you want? You know, I could have said anything that would have demoralized him the rest of the way. I mean, he was the tip of my finger, right? I could have done anything with him. And I could have ruined him for weeks. Or I could have made it all about me. Hey, screw you. I'm going to hear about me and a champion player. If you can't be a champion, then forget you. I mean, you could do whatever you wanted to. In that moment, I kind of owned him. And that's the kind of a soft skill. A talent is really about stepping in the other guy's shoes. Kind of that selfless way of kind of looking at, look, if I'm going to be successful, because I'm going to be in the headline tomorrow in the playoff game. It's going to say, Steve, you're on something. Stinks or was great. And that being the fact, I can't make my kind of, my play, my pecking order to Terrell Owens in the middle of the game, let him know that I'm the king. Certainly he's going to help me with the headline, right? If that's my incentive, which not necessarily is my incentive, I'm just giving you an example. And so those soft skills are really about standing out of the people's shoes and inspiring them in individual ways. And the only way you can do that is spend time with them. The only way you can do that is get to know them. And that's why the locker room on the road to the plains and the bus, at the hotel, training camp, and the dorms. I really took, I mean, I enjoyed, maybe that's why it was easier for me, but I enjoyed kind of going room to room in the dorms in the middle of summer camp when everyone's tired. And just wrapping people, you know, how's it going? You're getting to know their wives' names, getting to know a little bit about their kids, where they're from. So now you can pour. Now you can use that report in the next day in practice when somebody's something funny happens. You go, well, I bet today it wouldn't happen back in Knoxville. You know, you just, now they know you know them. You know what I mean? And you're involved with their lives, and then the interaction starts to build and build and build, and it gets more layered. And then over time, you get, with Jerry Rice, I've been with 15 years. Now, it gets to a point where, and you're going to negotiate with someone for 15 years, unless you're married. But I got to a point where Jerry Rice would be running down the field. And it happened very obviously many times when the crowd would be screaming as loud as they could. A lot of times you had to break the huddle, and everyone would be like, what? What's the plan? You know, and you're like, we can't, I can't explain it to everybody. We got to go. And so a lot of times, I'd be under center yelling as loud as I could, and I'd look out at Jerry, and he'd be like, you know, what? Like, what am I supposed to do? And I'd be like, and he'd be like, and then we'd snap the ball, we'd start, and he'd start running. And I'd drop back, and I'd throw them the ball. And he'd catch it. And we'd go back, and the game goes so fast, you don't have time to really appreciate those moments, but later you'd say to yourself, neither of us knew what we were doing. We had no plan. But here he was running down the field, and I, because I'd been in the so long, I kind of, you could see where he was going. Like, I could tell what he was going to do by his body language. To me, that's an element of that soft skill. If I never really did attention to Jerry, until he was open, then, or I didn't pay attention to what, you know, his history of his life, and how he grew up, and it was a hard scrap, well, kind of thing, and dirt roads, and Mississippi, and his dad was a tough brick layer, and he was laying bricks at six, seven years old in the hot summer, you know, he was like, you get to know people, and now you start to fill it with him, and what happens is this, I don't want to make it too soft, but, you know, you get to know him so well, and so, well, you kind of, I could tell his body language, his body spoke to me as he ran, I was like, I didn't know where you're going. Boom, I thrown the ball, and that's a no better example I can think of, than the soft negotiating skills you're talking about. Yeah, and I remember what you just said reminded me of a conversation we had years ago, when, you know, it wasn't always great for you with the 49ers, you were sort of the understudy, and the coaches I remember were pretty down on you, early in your career, and I remember you and I talking about that, and one of the coaches I forget which one kind of gave you a little lecture on, hey, you need to start performing a little better or else. Can you talk a little bit about that story and lessons you learned? Do you remember the story? Yeah, I do, I think it's the one I think, and I hate, stand, go, okay, remember that story, and I'm like, oh, stand, I'm beyond that story. I'm doing much more important things, you know. Why don't we talk about what I'm doing now, make myself feel better, and he's like, no, it's not that exciting. It's boring. We did prepare for this. People don't want to hear the boring stuff, I'm like, no, but that's it. So, you know, I came in, I'm six foot, flat, maybe a quarter inch, and what did you put on your football card? I wrote six, too. Because anyone, I mean, when a height, a height especially is so important in basketball, but also quarterbacks because, you know, Doug Flutey suffered for years and years and years and years because he was 5-8. He couldn't get out from under it. When games, all these football games are people like, yeah, but he's 5-8. It's sick the way they kind of do that, but the truth is, is that height matters because there's so many big guys on the field that literally you can't see, unless you're 6'5". And so, a lot of times, I would drop back to pass, and there's huge guys in front of me, and I'm 6'5". And so, and being 6'5 was the key, right? If I was 5'11 and 3'4", oh, you know, if it started with a 5 and the NFL, they would like panic. But 6'5", you know, was enough to panic through the door. But so, I'd drop back to pass, and I'd be looking, you know, and I'm like, oh crap, I can't see. And I'd like move aside, I'd take a move aside, and I'd like, I can't see. And then in the NFL, I mean, it's like boom, boom, boom. It's not like you go, okay, hold up for a second, I can't see, you know? It's like, you've got to look, right? And then you're just, you're flouting your back. And so, I'd be like, I can't, and I'm down. And so, we'd go to the silence, the coach would say, see, Jerry Rice was open. You know, white in throw in the wall. Well, what I say, could Sam? And so, his comment, which is awesome, it's typical, my dad, we better start seeing him. Right? Thanks for the tip. That's why I go, that's my entire college education, you know, one right there. Just better start seeing him. And so, I got to thinking about it. You know, these are opportunities that the taller guy have taken advantage of. And they're all our taller guys. Just so happened, the guy behind me at the time was Elvis Gerbach. I don't know if any of you have seen him, if you've been around a long time. But he was a Michigan, he was like 6'6", you know? And so, you know the coaches taken, right? Keep it up. I got Elvis Gerbach, he's 6'6", he won't miss that, right? So, you think, how am I going to be 6'6"? I can't, I can't do it. I can't put stills on, I can't have a high heels, I can't, you know, what am I going to do? And so, I started thinking about, you know, I'm in a tough spot. I don't know, I'm not sure where the negotiation plays here, but it's also about understanding yourself, understanding your own weaknesses. Negotiation in my mind is really having a self, you need to stand, you've got to need to stand back from yourself and kind of say, okay, what am I good at? Where am I holes? What gets me in trouble? Could be a temper, right? I got a temper and it crushes me in negotiation. In my case, I'm 6'6", you know, it just happens to be my profession. I got to step away, what are the things, and there are many other things that I was, my shortcomings, we all have them, right? What are they? Let's start to understand them and let's start mitigating those issues because I mean to get in the middle of something, if I'm going to succeed, if I'm going to reach what my goal is, I need to figure out a way around that one. I'm not going to grow. Now, there's other things you could have a temper, you could actually work on, right? I'm going to go to therapy or I can work on temper control or, you know, one of my best friends had the worst temper and now he doesn't, so you can get rid of it, but you can't grow. Right? I'm not going to grow, I'm 6'8", I'm actually going to shrink right before I grow. I might be 5'7", but so I started thinking, well, you know, I drop back, I can't see, I just saw the receiver, I'm sucking it go, I know where he is, I just can't see him. So what am I going to do? I'm going to throw it anyway. On faith, brutal, brutal endeavor for a quarterback. Because I mean you can't afford mistakes. Even in practice, you make a lot of mistakes, people like, hey, you know, this is the NFL, this is the, you know, especially on Joe Montana, I mean it's like, it's embarrassing, every time someone runs, I had to have that. So also, I'm going to start throwing blind. And what was amazing about it is that I started a completing him. Now, they weren't in the same right spot, right? They'd be ahead or higher, but they were being completed. And no one cared. It wasn't like I turned to the coach and said, I threw it blind coach, you know. That one wouldn't have been, that one wouldn't have been completed, but for my kind of ingenuity, right? And no one cared, even Jerry Rice, I say, Jerry, I'm going through this metaphysical process of learning to throw the ball blind. And so that's why the ball's not in the perfect spot, usually I put it right here, right? And now it's, you know, and his response was, well, I don't care, put it right here, right? Because no one cares. That's why that self-analysis is so important. Because no one, even your mom, especially your mom, because she loves you so much, she doesn't want to show you all your things you're horrible at. Who really have to be the one that kind of steps back and says, you know what, I have holes. And if you think you're that great, just recognize that you have them, step back and make a study of it. Because if you want them to be a great negotiator, it truly is understanding. I can use your weaknesses that you don't understand about yourself against you every time. Ad nauseam. Honestly, until you're just driven into the ground. I mean, you guys that had weaknesses or insecurities in my team, if I needed to, I owned you. I didn't necessarily have wanted to do that. It wasn't my, my, my, my, my, but in the end of the day, if I needed to get things moving along in the team and get things moving forward and scoring touchdowns, getting people going, you guys, you know, you'd use those techniques if people had holes. And how would you, not that, that's a great point. How would you use that against the competition? Whether that's, you know, you had certain relationships with some sort of things. That's what I mean. I mean, I, you know, you, you, you would work, you would foster great relationship with your teammates. You took advantage of your teammates and insecurities and you, you're going to fail. I mean, the long run. But you look at, when I talk about driving people in the ground, you talk about defense, the other guys, it was amazing to me. Once I learned the game and got settled in and relaxed and really studied the game and became kind of a, a, a true professional, I could start to study the 11 guys that were across from me. I mean, in the moment, I could look them in the eye and I started to, by studying them on film and, and, and getting to know them better, you could give, they'd give themselves away. One of my favorites was for the Dallas Cowboys with Darren Woodson. He played many years for the Cowboys at safety. He was a very good player, very good guy, smart guy. And so being so smart, he would use that smart, you know, kind of trick people. He was very tricky, but his tricks were always the same because we're all creatures of habit. You know, I had, I always worked on things I did every time the same, like, because you had to break them mold, because if you did everything the same, everyone got to jump on you. That was that same analysis of yourself. What, what do I give it? What are my little, what's the, I hate poker, but I, you know, it's all that same stuff, like, what's my tell, right? What's my little thing that I'm giving away? Studying that, understanding yourself, now using it against your, your opponent. Darren Woodson, every time he was going to blitz, right, he was going to come and blitz me, he wouldn't look at me, right? Because it was almost like, if you looked at me, I would tell, I could tell. So he'd be looking away, and I'd be like, oh my gosh, here he comes. Right? I almost wanted to know, Darren, look at me. Like, you know, to just play with him, because he's like, I guess, yeah, I don't know where you are, I don't know. But that's, I mean, in negotiations, and it's not necessarily, I never want you to think that I would be preaching, taking the advantage of other people's weaknesses to gain the advantage and pound them into submission. Because that, that won't, that doesn't work over the long haul. I mean, because I know in negotiations and football, it's a little bit of a differentment, because the score and everything else. But truthfully, in most negotiations I've ever been involved in, if, if, if there's not a sense, and I know this is old schools, it's like you're saying symbionic or when it's like, huh? But that win-win thing, right? Because if you don't find a way for everybody to kind of gain momentum together and find a place to land, I'm in negotiations all the time in business now. If you don't allow people to place the land, you're in for the dog fight of your life. People will not give in if they don't have a soft place to land. If you don't give them a place to go that feels okay, that feels safe. Again, remembering a story about sort of giving them a soft landing. You had to deal with coaches a lot, and I remember your offensive coordinator had some pretty specific ideas about what plays he wanted you to run. You were one of the few quarterbacks in the NFL to be calling your own plays. So how did you kind of negotiate with him and how did you prepare so that you could kind of get the plays run that you wanted and have a conflict with him? Well, I mean, on campus you're Bill Walsh, who is, you know, I mean I could spend the next hour and 15 minutes talking about Bill Walsh, and I have you weeping about how great her coach he was, how, what an innovative head of the game, enlightened. He brought football into the next generation. I mean football was archaic, and every coach used the whip. You know, never used the carrot very effectively. It was by submission. I'm going to pound you in submission to get you to do what I want. Very old school stuff. You know, embodied by the fact that no one would ever give them a drink of water, right? That was the old way. I'm going to break these guys where they, you know, I won't give them, Bill was like, well, give them some water. You know, and let's not pound them in submission. Let's use the, you know, he was just an enlightened guy. And being here on campus, Stanford gets to take a lot of credit for that in Silicon Valley. He was Silicon Valley before Andy Grover, you know, I don't know if that's true. I mean, I'm going to be on YouTube, so I better be careful. But Bill gets a lot of credit for kind of being Silicon Valley maybe before anyone even Steve Jobs even started. I don't know when he started that pull. He was in 1882, just that enlightened kind of human relations kind of thing. But one of Bill's soft spots for me was he loved to come up with great ideas. He was ingenious. And so I noticed that if you could feed him something that he could come up with an idea, you could actually get your play call, right? Because it would kind of like not that he had to author it, but it was almost like he was, he'd say, well, what if you, like if I said, here Bill, here's a play that I've been working on. I think it will really work. I don't know that he would be like, yeah, that's nice. But I say, Bill, what do you think, the play that you brought up yesterday, that was really interesting. But if think about if he went, the guy went this way in that way. What do you think about that? He'd be like, now that's an idea, right? That's a great idea. Let's call out this, this, and this. And then boom. We're on our way. And I guess that's what you mean. So making it about them in that way. Right, because he was ingenious. And so he's so good at creating plays that you'd almost kind of get in with them flow. Like, okay, if he's going to be creating all these plays, well, I think I got some good ideas. I'm going to get in with them. And rather than fighting him and saying, well, I have good ideas too. Hey, what about me? You know, just, you know, getting in with him, and getting his respect. You come up with a good, good ideas, things, and he'll start saying, hey, that young kid, he's got some good ideas. You know, and pretty soon, you know, after a year or two, he's going, Steve, what do you think? You know, well, that was impossible two years ago. So I just, I mean, that's another little piece of kind of understanding people around you and getting to yes kind of thing. That sounds goofy, but that was kind of, you know, in football, you have to score. There's a time. There's no time to kind of cock it or rethink it or, oh, let's go, let's go. Let's, let's, you know, sleep on it, you know, you know, it's, it just, it wasn't the profession. It was here and now we're in. And there's no excuses. There's no getting out. The lights are on and they're on for another three hours. They'll be off soon, but for right now, we're in this together and it's going to be embarrassing or it's going to be great, depending on how we handle the next three hours. So before, I remember through a tough time with the media. Sometimes they weren't always supportive of you and you really, I think, did a good job of eventually winning them over. And that, I sort of saw that as a negotiation. So how did you, certain experiences come up from kind of how you dealt with the media and where they fare to you and the fairness matter and how did you deal with the media from a negotiation? Well, there was a time here in town where, you know, we talked about this thing with Joe and so forth that I was the new guy and was not so easy to disregard me because I hadn't done anything. And so actually, it wouldn't be disregarding. It would just be being normal. I mean, how can you disregard someone that has no regard? But, you know, I learned in the same way with my teammates that the media guys would write things that are tough. They would take things out of context and recreate it. I think of guys that are covered in the team every day, right? The beat writers. They had to come up with a story about the 49ers every day. I'm in the middle of it all in the locker room. And if I had to come up with a story every day, it's impossible. There's not that many interesting things going on. There's nothing much entry. There's nothing that's really newsworthy every day. But I have to write a story. And so, what I started to think about, because I was always kind of getting pounded by him and I would, and I think that they always expected me to come and kind of complain, hey, you're being unfair, you know, you should think about it. I basically just was happy. You know, hey, hey, how you doing? You know, Ira? Good to see you. You know, and he just ripped me that morning. So, he was waiting for, he wanted a tankal. I mean, you know, Ira, you're doing good to see you. You know, because I just, there's no wind. There's no way to win. What's it like I was going to go and say, what you wrote is so crappy. You know, you didn't look at it this way and you need to see it. That's what they, they, they, they've, they've thought I've done it. You know, and so you just, why even go? And it wasn't like I was going to win him over by being nice. It's just that I had no, I had no place. I didn't see a place to kind of enter and be influential in what was happening. And so as I did that, I started to see that these guys that were coming on every day to write stories. Everyone else looked at them as like these pariahs hanging around trying to, some factoid and trying to use it again. I'm like, well, they're not going away. They're here every day. You know, they, they must be looking at us as like these spoiled rich athletes. I mean, what, how do they see what's going on every day? Same kind of thing, right? The soft skill. Like where, where are they coming from? And then I realized that I started thinking myself, these poor guys kind of drive down from Napa through traffic, you know, crossing the bridge and getting down and back then in Silicon Valley was just in the mid, not especially. You can drive from Napa to Santa Clara every day. You had to be kidding me. Grind is all the way down there, come down and have these guys tell you nothing. I finally realized, you know what? Who best thing I can do is give them something. They give a little something and they can, something they can write a story about. You know what I mean? What a blessing that would be if I had driven all the way down from Napa, fighting traffic. I have to write something. If the quarterback of the team actually, you know, help me out with his little something. Doesn't necessarily about me. I'd like, you know, what happened? You know what? We got this new grass. You know, and our, our, our guy that was in charge of the grass, our groundskeeper, like he was the kind of guy in, Carrie check that actually ate it and see if it was good. You know, he'd live in it, you know. He was awesome. Rich, Rich was the name and he, you know, and so I was like, you know, that, you know, no one's ever, and so I told him that he'd put in this new turf one year in our practice field. So that was more hargier, you know, wouldn't wear out and he wouldn't have to re-plan it and the fall all, you know, and it changed seasons and stuff. I said, you know what? We've got this new and so he wrote and so that day went for a heart to rich and had all the quotes and he had a story next day. 49ers cutting edge of agronomy or whatever that is. Is that what it is agronomy? I don't know. I think that's the new animals. Anyway. But, but, you know, and what happened is it wasn't like I was trying to have him say, oh, treat me more than fair. You know, when I make mistakes, don't pound me. I didn't even, that wasn't even where I was coming from. It was more like the look. We're in this together. It's like a three-year-ing circus. Yeah, my rings over here and you're, we weren't really intersect because you're doing something completely different, which is talking about things that, you know, aren't necessarily true and that I'm over here living this life. But we're in this thing. We're in the same tent, right? We're in this together. Let's figure out ways to work together where we can make our time together more productive. And in the end, I believe you'll be more fair. You'll be, you'll do the same back. I wasn't quid pro quo. Hey, by the way, you know, but just human nature, right? You know, what I might dig, I heard something about the guy that was maybe not so flattering. Instead of just running with it and not getting a quote from me, maybe a come to me. You know, this is what I heard. You have a comment. At least give me a shot to defend myself, right? And so over the years, my relationship with the, with the guys in the media, were really, I don't want to make too much of it, but they were really neat relationships that I enjoyed. And when I retired, I actually did miss them. I miss kind of seeing them every day and jossing with them and making fun of them and, and, and, and laughing with them or whatever else. It was another, and really it, it enriched my life down to practice field every day. I was bored to tears a lot of times too. And instead of this fighting, you know, there they are, they're out to get me. You know, I kind of look at a different look at a whole different, different way and it energizes, got there, you know, and just was all positive. And not only does negotiation necessarily just kind of working through your life. And I think it is, I think places to, to, to, and it's not really soft to, it's not like, oh, I'm enriching everyone's life. It's just, look, we're in the, we're in it together. Yeah, we talk, we talk a lot in the class about relationship management, have a sort of build relationships that you can then do good things with that. That might be a nice segue just into things you've done since football, maybe talk about kind of family and how you approach negotiations from a personal perspective different than maybe you did on the football field. Or is it the same stuff? A lot of the same things. Today, my wife usually gives me a list of things, right? You know, I got to get done. And inevitably, I don't know what it is. She thinks it's subconscious that I'm not together. But, but it's not. It's not subconscious. I'm not. But inevitably, something, I forget something. You know, or something I do it wrong. You know, I mean, the dumbest, you couldn't believe it. And then so many times, I think, she, you have to believe I mean it to do it wrong because to do it wrong. But it just happens. And so I take that same quality I told you about interceptions. And what I do is I immediately tell her, look, I screwed it up. You know, but I'm going to go fix it. And so she can't complain. Here's a kid that sees that he screwed it up. He's going to go fix it. And I, you know, it's funny that I used, I learned that in football and I, and I, and I use it every day in my marriage. And so I think there are things that are the same. And then there's things that just aren't. You know, when I said, you know, football was all about the moment. Like we can talk about it tomorrow. But right now, we got to go. And in life, that's not necessarily the case. Every once in a while, there's moments when things have to happen. But most of it's just kind of managing relationships. And, and that take, you know, it's the same soft skills we've been talking about. But, you know, the football was different. But personally, you know, there's the same elements, though, to me, of the soft skills in football or the same marriage or the family or anything else. Like my kids, I mean, I got six, four and a newborn. And I'm busy. I'm running around. And everybody spent a lot of time with my kids. But I realize I'm spending a lot of time with my kids in the car on the phone. But I'm spending time with my kids. I'm not that same skill of kind of hey, step in back. Wait a second. What's his experience? His experience is sitting in the back seat and his car seat. Listen to me talk to people on the phone. He's not with him. And it was like it was hit me one day. It's like, look, I'm kidding myself. That I'm really around my kids a lot. I have interaction in and out of the car, you know, or there's all these great moments. And so it's like it's all the same stuff. It's being on step back. Okay, what's my whole, yeah, you know, I'm thinking I'm doing this great service. And I'm doing actually hurting them because now with them and I'm not with them, which is actually double negative. And so it's just, you know, the same things I use in football. I find myself doing the same things in my personally. I remember, and we'll just maybe make this the last question and take some questions from the students. So I remember at the end of your career, maybe it wasn't the end of your career. Maybe it was after the Super Bowl. And you had a little trip down at Disney Land. He might talk a little bit about that. But talk about kind of how you keep things in perspective. You know, you're a celebrity. You're still a celebrity. I remember recently being Steve and I were getting cream and there were a couple of girls. These were definitely. Well, I'm not a celebrity in Palo Alto. They don't care. But I'm very big in San Jose. I don't know what it is. I'm very big in the East Bay. I'm big downtown. Less big and burly game on sale. I hit Sunnyvale. Big again. Palo Alto, Atherton, Menlo Park, Nupig. It's all about Steve Jobs and you know. Other Steve's. He lives like three doors down. And it's like, I'm nobody. We're just perfect. Well, I remember just a quick anecdote. Maybe a year ago we were getting some ice cream at Gelato in Palo Alto. Two girls and they were definitely kind of, you know, teenage, not yet women. They were kind of mumbling behind us. And that's Steve Young. That's Steve Young. That's Steve Young. And I figured you didn't hear. And Steve, all of a sudden out of the blue, just turned around and said, yep, it's really me. Well, I have a face. I have this me all the time. Daily almost on the airplane. Yeah, someone will look at me. And it could be anywhere. I was in, I traveled to Ghana, Africa two or three weeks ago. And, you know, I'm in Accra Airport. And someone's looking at me. And I know what they're thinking. I know them. But I don't know where. I have this face that people, they feel affiliation with me. But they can't place it. And it happens almost universally. And so you could see them kind of. They're looking. And I handle it all different ways. But a lot of people say, I know you, a lot of people say, I know you from somewhere. And I, a lot of times, I say, well, where'd you go to high school? Because that's what they're thinking. They're like, did I go to, do I, do I work with you? I mean, we'll have fun with them. And finally, they'll kind of, well, either I'll tell them, or, you know, I usually don't try to embarrass them or anything. But at times, it gets embarrassed from back to me, right? Because I was at the airport, San Francisco, sitting at the gate, kind of reading the paper and the lady next to me. And she was elderly. 70, 75, 80. And she was reading her paper and she classed over. And I could tell that there was that, you know, she, she kept. And she finally, she goes, you know what? You look a lot like Stevie Young. And I said, you know, this is, I just, I go with what my action, I said, well, yeah, a lot of people say that. And so not knowing where it was going to go next, but usually it's no big deal. So she takes three, four beats and says, I don't like him. And I was like, crap, I gave him much time. But I used to that response and so I was like, so what do I do? What do you do right then, right? I go, why? I got it. And so she, she, she, she said, I, I, you know, I love the 49ers. And, you know, when he came, he, my favorite player was Joe Montana. And he ran him out of town. And I'll never forgive him. And I don't mind. I don't blame him. I really don't blame people for that. It was a really tough time. But so I laughed about it. It's not personal. I don't mind that. But it's just funny. People's reaction. And you know, universally, if this hasn't happened to you, it will. When you meet someone of, you know, I put into your classic celebrity quotes celebrity. I mean, celebrity quotes, you know, where someone says, well, they're celebrity. But you meet someone who has some celebrity. Your brain, you lose 50 to 60 points on your, your IQ. Because the first thing out of your mouth is usually ridiculous. And it happens, it happened to me when I met Charlton Heston. I was like, hey, great and bend her. It does. The first thing you say is ridiculous. And so I was happy to me on both sides because it happens to me all the time. The first thing people say to me is like, you know, something kind of goofy. They can't help it. So watch yourself when you meet someone that's got some celebrity. Like, even the more you think about it, the more you'll screw it up. You know, I remember at our house in Arizona when you met my uncle Buzz Aldrin. And you asked him super awkwardly if it would be okay if you got it. You're picture taken with him. He laughed at you. Yeah. That's all. So, values and what's important to you and kind of after the Super Bowl, you made a trip down to Disneyland. So, this is a classic one. In fact, it's so classic, you might have offhandedly heard of it. But it's really, you know, for me it was fundamental. So, all the years I've been playing, you know, Joe Montana was mostly known about Super Bowl. If you're he's a champion, he went four times. And so Steve Young, Yees, Gays, Gays, Gays, and everybody else want a Super Bowl. So I finally went to the Super Bowl. And it was really important that I won it. And then, you know, it was just stuff. It was just like, well, you know, they both went to Super Bowl. So, yeah, Joe went to four, but, you know, ones that went to the lot. And so, the night before the Super Bowl, you know, the PR guy came to me and said, hey, Disney wants to do the thing where they yell on the camera, what are you, you know, in the year MVP of the Super Bowl, what are you going to do? And you yell, I'm going to Disneyland. And that was kind of like being in the Weedies box. It was a great thing. But they did it to about 10 guys because they didn't know who was going to be the MVP, right? It could be you, to be showing off. And so they offered like $2,500 to be a part of this promotion. But it was not really, obviously, wasn't about the money. It was just kind of a neat thing to do. And so I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll do it. So I ended up being the MVP of the game. And so we're so excited that we won the game with Roddy Knox or PR director random. So you've got to do that Disneyland thing. There's the camera. And so I was happy to be near Jerry Rice. I go, Jerry, do this with me because he'd already done it a couple years ago. He'd been MVP. And so let's do it together. It'd be fun. And typical Jerry goes, will you money? No, he didn't say that. So we both yelled in the camera. You know, we know you went into the Super Bowl. I'm doing what we're going to Disneyland. But what I didn't realize was that because the contract, I mean, being a lawyer and everything, I don't read contract. It's in the small print says that you are going to Disneyland. It's not matter. It's not a metaphorical thing. And not only going to Disneyland, you're going tomorrow. That was the deal. I didn't realize that. After the Super Bowl. They have Super Bowl. So we're in Miami. Obviously, you know, the Super Bowl party went through the night. And then I was on Good Morning America. Like, what is that? Six o'clock in the morning. Then I had to go and get the MVP trophy. And then we went to the airport and got on the plant. Boss and the plane flew to San Francisco, got off the plane. Went to Market Street, heard the trolley cars, did the parade down, you know, Market Street. And then immediately got in the car with Jerry Rice. And we went to S.I. Photo Flight Anna to go to Disneyland. I mean, honestly, my mom, my family, my family, where are you going? I'll be back. So we went down to Disneyland. And I got to tell you I landed and anyone that had been to Disneyland, we were right in front of the castle. And I had to set the stage. Because literally there was a stage. Like there's a big float. And on the float it said Steve Young, Jerry Rice, Super Bowl MVP's and Golden Red Streamers. And on top was myself, Jerry Rice and Mickey Mouse. And so in front was the Disneyland Band. I don't know if you knew they had one, but they have a band. And so we went down Main Street. And I just remember being on this float after all I had been through my whole life, you know, just the tough times, the good times, everything. And here I was at Disneyland. And people were going crazy. I mean, the place was packed. It was California, Super Bowl was in there. They just watched it last night. There we are. So they're going crazy, you know. And like, I try to keep a handle on myself. You know, it's my dad's teaching, you know, that you don't want to lose yourself in anything. Cause you know, you're not that big of a deal. And I got to be honest with you, I lost it right there. I was huge. I remember thinking to myself, I am the man. You know, I am huge. I was like, doing the Richard Nixon. You know, I was like, I'm a man. And, you know, and I remember for that like 300 yards, you know, down Main Street to the end. I was as big as it could be. And, and the reason why I remember that so vividly is because at the end of the ride, the bands stop playing the noise died down. And we turned to kind of go backstage at Disney. As we turned on the street, there's stoop. You know, the curb was there. And there's two little kids are sitting on the curb. And they're waiting to, you know, they're waiting. The stupid things in the way and they're waiting to go. And their mom addressed them exactly like, you know, how they do that. And I'm going to say they're six and eight years old. And so they're sitting on that curve like this. And the little one looks up and sees this float and he goes, Mickey Mouse. Well, kids, you can imagine. I mean, there he is. It's like the ultimate moment for a little kids. Like, there's Mickey Mouse right there. And so he starts to run towards the stage. And before he can get to the float, his brother grabs him by the shirt and pulls him back so he can't get near him. The two big guys won't let you. I know it sounds stupid. You know, I know it's like ridiculous, but it was like it was like a moment because I remember wanting to yell. I mean, I remember wanting to yell the kid kid. Read the sign, you know. All the times in my life is not about Mickey Mouse is right now. Needless to say, it is about me. And I want you to understand that. And so it was a perfect, perfect kind of moment for me to realize that. Here I was the ultimate. And it lasted about 350 yards down Main Street. And I think it's pointed for me in my life, too. Because as much as I made my life about winning a Super Bowl, it lasted such a short time. And even that was a great accomplishment with a lot of great guys. But truthfully, it was just another kind of place to gas up and get charged and go on to the next thing. And it was more, no more point in that little boy saying that it was all about Mickey Mouse. And I've hated that experience because hubris is a very damaging, damning thing in people's lives. The idea that, you know, I am a man. And I've seen people negotiate with a sword and a whip and be successful. And I won't say that over time that gets you because I've seen people do it for a long time and be successful. But I can tell you that the value of negotiating that way and living that way, it's diminishing returns. There's no question about it. It is an eternal law. And as you guys learn about negotiations and finding ways to kind of get to yes for yourself, there are going to be great goals out there for you. You know, whatever it is, super bowls for yourself. And I just want to be the first example of, you know, don't let your negotiation and winning lose yourself. Because it's a damaging place to live. And I'm grateful for football to teach me all those different lessons. I could have never learned as quickly and as effectively if it wasn't for, you know, 50 guys and another 50 guys on the other side and the lights on. And millions watching in the game itself. So I am grateful. It was the perfect place to learn about negotiation. All right. Well, those are great comments. Let's give Steve a hand. So we have about 45 minutes for questions. And so if you'd like to ask a question, come and line up over here at the mic. And put you in line. Yeah. Anyone like to ask a question? Seriety want to jump in? Sure. Might as kind of a funny question. But what if any less about negotiation? Have you learned from your kids? Well, that's interesting. You know, kids are, you know, fundamentally irrational till they're about five or six. This is for my own experience. Right. So I'm not saying that's true for my own screen. And so I've noticed that I'm all about getting things accomplished. And I want my kids to accomplish with me. Like we're all doing this guy. And I get these irrational responses. And they're not. I find myself like, no, we're, you know, and I find myself rationalizing with them. Right. Okay. Look, this is how this works. And we're going to do that. And if we prepare and I get you guys warning and let you guys know what's coming, we're all going to get this done. Right. We're all going to we're marching together. You know, I'll even march with them. Okay. Mark. And make fun. Make games of it. And inevitably there's this irrational moment where everything just goes to Hess. You know, it's like just everything devolves. And I'm like, no, we're going to, you know, and so I continue to effectively try to rationalize with them. And I think the best lesson is that we get caught in what our goal is. I have a goal, right. I have a thing I'm going to get accomplished. And I'm going to get accomplished regardless. And what I'm doing is I'm accomplishing it right over there. Kind of like running right over them. And that's not to say that, you know, don't you, you can obviously rationalize them. But in the end, it's the same thing. You know, my kids teach me that it's, you know, you, you, you have to navigate to get to the goal many times, almost always. And I found the kids that I need to stop and navigate them or else I'm getting to the goal. And it's very ineffective lesson for them. And it's a very hollow victory for me. Yeah, we got to the store. We got to meet them. Boy, it was miserable. You know, and it's really taught me to be more creative. I'm very goal oriented. And I very, you know, you give me a task. I'm like a horse of the barn. Maybe we're going. And that's a great quality. But I'm, you know, and as you list, as we talk about your holes in your life or your personality, other things, there's also the great things you're at going. But most, a lot of times, the things that you're great at, they're sticking out the backside too as a real negative part of yourself. Like, I've really spent the last few years of my life recognizing these things are really good at, which means there's something sticking out the back that I need to chop off. You know what I mean? And, and really taking the time to figure out how to do that most effectively. That's to me, the most mature thing that I can accomplish in my life is accentuating the good things, getting rid of the things I'm horrible at and trying to make sure that I'm getting better at the stuff I'm mediocre at. And kids have a way of forcing you to slow everything down and figure out a creative way to not make it about yourself. And, um, mad. Because I mean, I like it to be about me, you know, time to joke. Welcome out, come down. Talk a little bit about sort of post-football. How you made some of the choices. You know, everyone here probably doesn't know that you, while you were in the NFL, got your law degree and you're not getting it. Oh, I get to talk about the boring things. Well, you know, there's a pause. Okay. I went to law school, graduating from BYU in 1994. And, one over six years, took second semester classes throughout the whole six years. I took first semester law school classes, which is all first year properties, torts. I audited them, passed them that allowed me to actually go back to class in the second semester for credit. And, I mean, I did them orally, so I got through law school, took me six years. And, obviously, a great accomplishment for me. I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed it. I loved going from the Super Bowl to law classes like the next day. I went to Disneyland, then I went to law school. Just, I enjoyed the give and take and a different personality. But then now I'm kind of taking that. What happened was, very smartly, a couple of my teammates recognized that as we were in Santa Clara right there next to Great America, where we practiced. In 1987, when we moved in, there was nothing down there. Literally, Cisco, 3Com, Intel, they all were built right there. And right under our nose. And, about 1994, when everybody was getting a little older, and we were like, well, what are we going to do next? One of my teammates says, we should get some of the venture guys to see if we can't trade them for access to deals or whatever else is going on. What do we have to offer? And what do we have to offer was locker room access, right? You know, come meet the guy. So we went, tried to find 100 rounds for VC that love football. And they wanted to come from the sidelines, whatever else. And it worked. We got great relationships. And we post, right when I retired, three of us started a fund of funds business in the venture capital industry, where we would go around and get $10 million slots in Sequoia, Benchmark, Excel, and Cliner Perkins. We put together $10 million slots, $100 million went and raised it from Lohan Partners. And we were the pastor of the fund of funds. And we had a little business. And we serviced, you know, there was a lot of Lohan Partners that couldn't have access to those funds, especially a wide variety of them. And so we started a business called Northgate Capital. And now they have a billion dollars in our management. I left them after we had about $350 million. And I started a private equity fund out of Salt Lake City called Swarge and Capital. And I was a partner in that. And that has been my goal when I retired was to be the dumbest guy in the room for at least 10 years. And has been very easy to do. Good, that's some good history. Thank you. Yeah, thanks for coming. I was wondering, you're talking about how you started out your career. And Joe Montana was an icon. And then when you ended, you were an icon yourself. I was wondering how that really, I know it was a process, but were there specific moments when things changed where you had that credibility? I appreciate that. I think the first place that had changed it within myself. For a long time, I thought I was chasing, I don't know what the Disney story is where they chase around. The tiger's chasing something that he turns the butter. I mean, they go so fast. It's like you just chasing your tail. You just run around. And it was like the whole world was saying, okay, if you want to be as good as Joe Montana, then you got to do this. And then I'd go running, jump through the hoop and, you know, and, and I realized that I was just, it was insane. The first step for me trying to kind of getting to a place where I could kind of accomplish the goals I had was to first recognize that it wasn't about Joe Montana. It really was about finding out how good I can get. And that changed everything. It just made my whole life. Why did what I did change? It was my incentive was different. And then once I realized that really the goal was to see how good I could get, I might be horrible, but I'm going to find out how good I am. And that's all I really want to know. It didn't get to be out anybody else. It was really about me. That kind of, that helped get things moving in the right direction, beginning my career going well. And then there are moments, big victories. Ironically, one of the most important one was perceptionally. I have the saying in law possession is 910th of the law. But in football, perception is 910th of the law. And I learned that so vividly, I'd been to the, I'd been the MVP of the league twice. I'd been the probals. In the middle of 1994 season, or about the fourth or fifth game, you were losing horribly. And our coach George Sefer decided to brought Trot, Elvis Gerber back on the field, kind of like forcing me to go off the field. And for me, after all I'd been through and all I'd accomplished, it was, it was, it was going to me that he was now at this kind of key moment going to make it look like, oh, yeah. And maybe I took it the wrong way, obviously. But I got, I exploded. And I hadn't exploded ever before. I mean, I lost it. And I, and I don't lose it. And I, I decided at that moment I was going to fight him. My head coach was going to fight him. We were going to fight right there. Like I've had it, I'm fighting him. And so I challenged him to fight. And I was, and so he wouldn't turn around like he was actually like he was watching the game. And I was behind him. And I was saying things and doing things. And I didn't realize I was so lost in it that I forgot that millions of watching TV. But I'm yelling at him and calling him names and telling him to turn around. And you know, if you got any good, you know, you turn around, you chicken, you know, just everything I could get him to fight him. And you know, he's not going to fight me on national TV. But I would have fought him. I had lost it. I was fighting. I was, my hands were on very tight. So anyway, what happened out of that was all week long, the stories became, Steve Young, our fiery leader. It's our fiery leader. I was like, what are you talking about? What do you mean, right? You fired, no fire. And I have no one has more fire than me. What do you do? But I had put it in a way that no one saw it all sudden by emoting it, people were like, oh, and that was where I got the perceptions 9-10th of law. Because suddenly I was the leader. I was like, I was somebody that, I mean, it was, I mean, that ironically one of the more fundamental shifts in my career to how people looked at me, both from a media standpoint, from my teammates standpoint, was me screaming at my coach. Who would have thought? You have lose it to gain it, you know what I mean? But I just remember that. Some of those weird things that, if you think that you're a fiery leader, that's not necessarily the case. You know what I mean? Because everyone else thinks you're a big milk toast. It doesn't matter. You're a milk toast. No, no, I'm fiery leader. We don't see it that way. So another great concept about negotiation is, how am I perceived? How are people perceiving me? I can use that to my advantage, right? And then also what are, this isn't how they perceive me. So I tell players all the time now, don't complain, don't mow, make sure people perceive you the way you want to be perceived. And that necessarily has a lot to do with reality, but the points may be good. Kind of awkward to come down to the mic, isn't it? So how did you negotiate with yourself and with your family as you chose this as your career choice? And you're facing the trade-offs. That's interesting. So I regretted it, Connecticut. And the Greenwich is not the habit of football. It's a bedroom community in New York, more known for golf and tennis than football. And I played all sports, and I didn't really have a plan. Other than I liked to play sports, I went to school. My dad was expected great, my mom and dad were expected great grades, which I gave him, which I wanted to do. And I was going to go to law school always. I was going to go to college. And what happened to me, and I don't know this happens here, but he is, if someone knocked on my door and wanted me to play a sport, I'd be glad to do it. And I went to school in college when it became time to recruiting for football. Suddenly I had people knocking on my door saying, we'll come and play college football for us. And being in Connecticut, a lot of the guys that recruited me were Ivy League schools, because I just had good grades, and they looked for the hat. And so I had no, I wanted to be playing football at Cornell or Princeton or Yale, which is down the street. And so I had done offers, and then I had full scholarships to Brigham Young to North Carolina. And so we were waiting, I remember my dad one day, was like, okay, so I really didn't give scholarships unless by need, which we didn't quite qualify for. My dad kept saying, why not my qualify for scholarship? We don't have anything. But so he was always like, okay, so $10,000 to go to play for Yale or free. I take free. And so I played football most of the time because I got me to college for free. You know, my family needed that. And I would have gone to college, but it would have been a debt situation and put many key families to have tremendous hardship putting their kids to college. And my family would have certainly done that. But going for free was a tremendous food for our family. And so it shows me in many ways. And then the next level was the pros. I finished my college career. And then here they came again. Okay, we want to draft you. I had some reticence about it just because I didn't, you know, I had anxiety about football. I wasn't, I worried a lot. I was a worrier in kid, you know. So it wasn't a natural thing. Like, oh, I can't wait to go play professional football because that was going to be a lot of pressure. And, you know, that'd be okay if I had less pressure in my life. But I ended up doing it and doing it for 18 years, which is comical if you look back at them. So I don't really, my family wasn't like my dad said, oh, don't play football or my mom. You know, my mom was the one eight years old, the famous story when I was eight years old, we played little league. Another kid from the neighborhood. I had the ball. He tackled me around the neck, which was illegal. And then threw me to the ground and knocked the window. I mean, I'm laying on the ground. I can't breathe. You know, my dad came out and pulled my pants out of the giving me air. And my mom came on the film. And I remember telling my dad, I'm telling her to go back, you know, because mom, if she came out and kissed me or do something, you're like kids would make fun of me or be horrible. But she stepped almost stepped on me and she headed for the kid who had hit me and grabbed him by shoulders. Don't you ever hit my son again? And so that was the most embarrassing thing a mom could do. But so, so my point is it wasn't like my mom was going to say don't play football. I mean, she was, she was in. I mean, she was very competitive and, you know, so there wasn't like, you can go play football in college for free. And there was no, there was no one in the family that said, oh, be careful, you can get hurt, you know, no one cared. There was never any, I mean, like that. In fact, my dad always very facetiously said that I was built for beating, you know, because I had thick bones and stuff like that. So football was perfect. He didn't beat me, but football. You were kind of known and then in the NFL, from being able to take a beating. I could tell you being nice. Any questions? We know you have experienced different industries in your career. So, I would like to tell you if there's any difference when you negotiate with people in business industry or people in football area. And how do you feel when you negotiate with them? Well, most of my negotiations in you can tell in football we're really surrounding about getting people to perform. And it wasn't necessarily about making a business deal about negotiating a sale of a company and purchasing sale agreement. Purchase sale agreements. But the funny thing about even when I'm in purchase sale agreements, the person who's selling their company or selling a piece of their company, it is, you know, it's a financial thing. There's no question about it. You know, what's the deal? And then, you know, not only what are the deal, when do I get my money? What's the escrow? What's the whole battle? What do you want me to do? But in the end, the reason why to me we get to, you know, kind of be the one that makes the deal is that everybody has unique and individual needs in their sale. All my uncles and my cousin have it, you know, they work here and they need a job and I promise to, you know, it's like everyone has unique things. And it's getting, a lot of them are embarrassed to say what they are. Oh, I have a cabin and I really, the company's been paying for it and I really need them to keep paying for it. No one says it. You're like, you're going to negotiate, you can't get it done. You're like, what is going on? Why can't we get there? Until you finally say, okay, so tell me more about what your business is. What are the things going on? And they're like, well, you know, I got this thing. Well, let's talk about that. How can we solve that? And so then all of a sudden he realizes, oh, I can tell you, what are these goofball things in my business? I ran my own business. I'm not used to having someone else know my business. And getting that comfort level where a guy can tell you what that deal is. So it is the same stuff in the end. But still, it's driving to what the money is. I mean, don't kid yourself. But in the end, the thing you can put over the line is when you can kind of individualize it and get inside their shoes and see what they're really worried about. A lot of times, my wife doesn't think it's the right thing to do. Let's educate her. Let's bring her in and show her a process and let's take down all the Chinese walls. Because a lot of people think, well, I don't want to bug. Let's just open up and put air in the process and seems to be very much easier to get to negotiation. Any questions? I think we've worn them out. Let's go with two more questions. Mikey, have a question, and Zoe? Yes. In the class with you, a lot of how to deal with people. Do you, can you give us some example, like real life? A tough guy? I spent the first hour and a half telling you about all the successes that I've had. But there are, I mean, just saying that. There are people that just don't like you. You know, I use all my little tactics. I'm like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I hate you. Right? I mean, there's a guy in the team. He was a pretty influential guy in the team. And he was predatory. He would see a weakness in somebody physically, emotionally, whatever it is. And he was predatory. He'd pounce. He'd crush people. And it would be relentless, embarrassing, brutal. But he's not a guy you wanted to fight. In football, it was kind of like, you know, in the end of the way it was like a, you know, a lot of Moses, you know, I mean, look, if you really have a problem with it, well, then we're going at it. And I'm not a fighter. I ain't like, I never punched anyone in my life. So I mean, I threatened a lot, but I never did. I just said, look, someone ever actually fought me on the like, wait, no. Anyway, what are we, why are we really here? Let's think about how, what got it here? Fake it till you make it. That was not true. But there are guys that just, you know, they just, I irritated him. You know, I mean, there's, you know, his goal to kind of make my life miserable. And I, you know, and then I'm telling you about, it's interesting that I'm just thinking about it. I never really thought much about this. But I actually did take moments. There were times, awkward times, where I'd come on the bus to go to the stadium or go to the plane or wherever we were. And there'd be one seat and he'd be there. You know, so down you go. And because you're trapped and he's trapped, I remember thinking, okay, I'm just going to talk, you know, talk to him. And I'd known enough about him that I could say, look, you know, and so it's amazing what you can do if you can actually talk to somebody and get them away from their comfort zone. And I remember my relationship, he never did like me. My relationship changed after we talked briefly. You know, I just actually sat and talked for a minute. He was not nearly as abusive as he was before. But so there's, I mean, you got to admit that there's just, and there'll be deals that you can't get done. I mean, if all the deals I've done the last two years and our private equity firm, there's 15 that couldn't get done for whatever reason. I don't know if that's necessarily negotiating failure, but you know, if you studied them, which I think I try to do kind of post post breakup, what are the things? You know, some of them are, you know, there's the internet deals that you can get done. But sometimes I'm sure there are things that I didn't do. Could you talk about contract negotiations in the NFL in terms of what are the agents roles? Are the agents sent of saline with your incentives? How are cramones does it get and your experiences with that? It's changed a little bit over the years. With Fra agency, there is some gamesmanship with management. A good agent can kind of, I think the most important thing is your agent has a relationship with management. They can pick up the phone and talk to them. A guy, you know, I see a lot of guys trying to break into business, telling him, hey, look, I'm a great, you know, I can do this for you, I can do this for you. But in the end, it really is about relationships in the NFL. It's like these guys are old school guys and maybe, you know, being able to just pick up the phone and talk to them is really one of the key differentiators and getting things accomplished. Other than that, most people are slotted. You know, I'm first round, 15th pick. Okay, what was lit last year? What's it this year? What's the range? It's a pretty tight range, negotiating it, getting you guaranteed money. Anyone who graduated free smart guy at NBA school that didn't sports law, could probably do 95th percentile, you know, in deals, right out the gate. So I don't know that there's a big difference, differentiator there. But the relationships obviously that they call up a pretty time and are the huge differentiator. And the other thing is a relationship with a player. My agent, me Steinberg, he negotiated tremendous contracts, but it wasn't the most valuable thing he did for me. He was a great psychologist because football thrives on Instagram. That's how they get you to play hard, right? Because you have no job security. Who wants to go ram into other people unless you have to? And if I don't, I'm not going to have my job. Football has no guaranteed contract. Literally, the 18 years that I played never did I have a contract that I knew for sure by contract that I'd have a job the next year or even the next game. It is at will game to game. Obviously, I get to a status. You're not going to get cut, but I'm just telling you by contract they could. And so that breeds incredible insecurity. Oh, coach, look, that'd be funny, especially when you're rookie or starting out. And so you can't go to your teammate and go, you know, you think you're crackers, right? And you can't call your dad because he has no context for it. So you call your agent. What are they saying about me? Well, you know, you're, you know, you know, I mean that's that relationship for that first few years is vital. And that's why I encourage young players come out of college, find a guy who you can commiserate with and who give you the time and help you through it. Because half the time of getting making a team is not just physical, it's emotional. It's keeping you going. Like not quitting and not pouting and not, you know, you know, getting lost in the emotion of it all, the security of it all. So to me, those are the two things relationship with management and your personalization with them is a great thing about. And the rest is is so the narrow that there's such a narrow negotiating slot that even if you screw it up, you know, you're not going to do too bad. I'm reminded of maybe we can sort of end with this story at your very first negotiation was with the team in a different league, LA Express. And you had quite a negotiation with that owner and maybe tell that story and what lessons you learned from it. Awesome. Awesome negotiation. There was a time 20 years ago, over 20 years ago, which isn't really amazing. What do you guys are 40 something? You're like, what the crap happened? Because it happens. It'll happen to you. You're like, what? But 1984, I was a rookie and there's new league. It was in the spring. You guys probably even realize this and it was really big. There's big money in it. John Trump owned a team. There's a lot of people getting paid. Rookies coming out, getting paid a lot of money. And I was one of them. I got to go to the LA Express with a team out of Los Angeles. And the guy who owned it was Bill Oldenburg, financial kind of, I would call him a financial manipulator, but he had made tons of money and was, you know, loved to show it. He was in the Trans-American Building Downtown Center, I'm Cisco, even though he ran the LA team. So the negotiation was going on and they thought they had a deal with my legion and so it was his birthday. He said, oh, this is perfect. I'll fly him out in my jet. I'll pick him up in my Bentley at the SFO. I'll drive the Trans-American Building. We'll bring him up. We'll have a big hoop lie in the building. Have a big set of Steve Young. Welcome to the team. And then I'll have a big thing and then I'll go to my birthday party. It'll be like a big thing. And so I flew in in his jet, got in the Bentley drove over. Now, remember, I'm not a college. Just like you have 20 bucks maybe in my pocket, right? I'm just like, whatever. I've never been to San Francisco in my life. Landed SFO, Bentley picks me up out of private jet. Go to the Trans-American Building, up I go and get out of the elevator, opulent offices. My name's up there and these lights coming across and streamers is deviant. And so, and then we were going to finish the negotiation and sign it that night as birthday. That was the plan. Well, my dad as a lawyer wanted to have it all read to him in Greenwich, Connecticut over the phone. As they finished the negotiation, at least I'm very disappointed. Like I got a call dad and so my dad wasn't like, what's the just. He's like, okay, so paragraph A. Yeah, go ahead. And so it was like taking a long time. And so Bill Olenberg, who was, you know, his birthday, he was, you know, he was getting more, you know, motive and he, frustration and, you know, what's going on? And so I've sitting, and this is a nice point negotiation sometimes. Just do nothing, right? Just sit in there and nights going on is getting more and more frustrated. But at least I'm with my dad and my dad's just like, okay, so finally he comes in and he's like, what's the problem? Why can't we, can we not finish this? I got it, you know, let's finish this. Is it money? Is it more money you want? No, no, I just tried my dad. But he said, he was at more money and he took his water like 100, like a big huge one and throws it at me. Boom, right there, hit some in the chest. Is it money you want? Money and I'm like, no, no. And so I didn't say anything. If you want money and only storms out. And I'm like, whoa, I've never seen so much money, you know? I told Lee, let's sign now. I got more money I've never seen. But my dad wouldn't give in and they never, what happened is it went on and they never got it quite done. And he finally, this is a case of six o'clock I arrive with lights and everything. At 12.30 we get escorted out of the building. The whole thing's off, you know, it's broken down because my dad had found something that Lee had to go negotiate again. He couldn't, he was mad about it. You know, I thought we were done. You know, we got escorted by security at 12.45 am. I'm down at the outside of the street of the trans worker, but at least I'm American. I just sit on the street like, no, what do we do? I said, I don't know, but I got about 15,000 dollars in my pocket. I don't know what you're going, but I'm going out. Oh, wow, that was awesome. I was 21. I mean, you can imagine it was awesome. And we ended up getting it done like four or five days later, but for a few days it looked like it was off, you know. This thing negotiations without just sticking with it and Lee was great at getting people back in, you know, like, hey, you know, that's this and that was one of his real talents and that's a people skill. I would say this, try to make a judgment for yourself. Am I a people skill person? I mean, that's a natural skill. We all have different skills. Some of them are blessed with people skills. And if you are, then you're on your way to being a natural negotiator. If you, that's not one of your talents that doesn't mean you can't be a great negotiator, but recognize that people skills are one of the big elements. And you can learn a lot of those skills by watching and really kind of stepping back and being kind of observer picking up things. And then finding, you know, it's all these soft skills that I talked about. So no one can't be a great negotiator, but some people have a leg up because to me, people that have those special people skills that are blessed with them. If they don't use it as a weapon and use it as a tool can be very effective. All right. Thanks so much for today. Thank you.
