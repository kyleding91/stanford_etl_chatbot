 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these elections online at eCorner.stanford.edu. How many of you heard about it before? OK, so I don't need to tell you that is the like the third most popular research engine in the whole world. It's got over 70% market share. It was started almost 10 years ago by Robin and his co-founder. And it's an extraordinary that we have a chance to have him here. Prior to that, he was kind of a search engine guru in the 90s by working at InfoSeq and others. And I don't know how we missed him, but he didn't go to Stanford. I wish he had. I wish he had. But he got his first degree at Peking University. And then he got a Master's in Computer Science at the State University of New York in Buffalo in 1994. He's of co-founders, you know, the chairman, the CEO, the grand, grand master of Vaudu. So let's welcome him to Stanford. Thank you, Professor Myers for your introduction. I'm really glad I finally made it here. I've always wanted to teach a class here in Stanford because I always wanted to lure the top talents from the world's most finest school. So finally, I'm here. Thank you for your interest. Today I'm going to talk about opportunities in China at the age of innovation. I picked this topic because I think this is a very important topic for many of you to know. Right now, I think we are still in the recession period. Although I've heard words that recession is officially finished, but I feel a little bit different. Last time I was in this country was May of 2008. I still feel that today the economic situation is not better but worse than what was like in May of 2008. I can tell from the newspapers I read in my hotel room, now the newspapers are a sinner than before I think companies still have less money to advertise. Why do I bring up this topic because I think everyone is probably thinking of what should we do? How do we deal with the recession or how do we deal with the difficult times? I think I have something to offer to you. If you look at this chart, I guess many of you follow the NASDAQ. This is a chart from about $99 to 2003. I do was founded at the beginning of 2000 and quickly NASDAQ reached its high. Historical high of 5000, I remember it was March of 2000. Then it dropped to about 1100 a year later. That is a very difficult time for people in the internet industry. I think it is much severe than what you have experienced in the past year or two for the general economic situation. During that time it is just the very early days of bydo startup experience. That is why when we officially entered the recession or the challenging situation caused by the financial crisis, I keep asking myself what should we do? What I learned during the last downturn, especially in the early 2000s when the internet bubble burst. I guess some of you still remember it is quite an experience for many of the companies and many of the people who work for those internet companies. We were lucky to raise the first round of money before the internet bubble burst. The challenge is that we really didn't have a bin model at that time. Didn't have a feasible bin model as well. Because when we started the bin model is to provide the backend technology, search technology to the portal companies in China. We did that. We came up with a very good Chinese search engine technology. We signed up a lot of the Chinese portals in a very short period of time that into China so that it is Yahoo China. And any portal company, you can think of in China. But what we quickly found was that we were still losing money. Although we probably signed up the portal companies that represent more than 80% of the Chinese search traffic, but it still could not survive. That's the challenge we faced. So quickly I realized that we were too optimistic about the future of internet in China. As that time, there were only about 10 million internet users. And the portal companies didn't want to buy the best search technology. They only want to buy the cheapest technology. That made our life very hard. So we realized that and I made the decision we need to change. We need to change to a different bin model so that we can come up with better technology and the better search technology can be appreciated by the market. So in the summer of 2001, we decided to switch gear from a backend technology provider to a front end consumer oriented search service. And on September 20, 2001, by Do.com went live. So it's been more than nine years or eight years. From that day on, I think we really found what was right for this company. Then we really focused on developing the best Chinese search technology and dominate the market. For the next eight years, this company have almost exclusively focused on Chinese search and came out with quite a number of innovative ideas related to search services such as post bar and such as related search such as box computing, Aladdin project, et cetera. In fact, in the year of 2002, shortly after we launched by Do.com, although I had the title of President and CEO, I basically went back to the engineering group and functioned as a project manager for about 10 months to make sure that we had the best technology in Chinese search. And after that, traffic took off. Our brand got very widely accepted in 2003. In 2004, we reached our last round of VC money led by Driftper Fisher, Jervin Stin, the sponsor of this class and Google, one of our great colleagues. Then a year later, 2005, the company won public. The ideal price was 27 and it closed on the first day at 122. It was great results for many of the by-doing employees and for all of the by-doing investors. It was a very miserable thing for me because when I decided to take the company public, I was only prepared to deliver financial results that matched the price of 27 or maybe a little higher, 30, 40. But I was really shocked to see that the price went to 122 on the first day. So that means I need to deliver real results that matches an expectation much, much higher than what I had prepared to do. But in any case, I had no choice. So I put my head down and focused on operation, focused on technology, focused on user experience. And I delivered. At the time of the IPO, I do had about 40% of the traffic share in China for Chinese search. Four years later, as of today, I think we have about 76% of the Chinese search traffic. In fact, I think by doing answers more queries in China today than Google does in the US. Because China is the largest internet economy by population. At the end of last June, we had 336 million internet users that's larger than the total US population. So US will never be able to catch up. And we have a very dominant traffic share over there. So it's really a very good spot to be in. So in retrospect, I think the way to deal with crisis, deal with challenge, deal with difficult time is like this. First, you need to be realistic. You need to take a pragmatic approach. Because in the beginning, we saw the portal companies will feed us. They will pay us enough amount of money. But that's not the reality. When the difficult time comes, they will try to survive by themselves. They will try to control costs. You have to be on your own. And then we figured that what we really good at was Chinese search. We decided to come up with a better search service, better product, better user experience. We started to innovate, come up with all kinds of features that attract Chinese internet users. So the second step is you really need to innovate and evolving. When I talk about, I give up the CEO job and function as a project manager. We actually named that project as project listen. We wanted to quickly catch up and surpass everyone in terms of search quality for Chinese users. Once you find out what you should do, then you need to stay focused. That's what we did during the difficult times back in year 2001, 2002. Many people think search was a down deal. It's boring. Everyone has figured that out in terms of technology and product. But we thought we could do a better job. We resisted all kinds of temptations from being a portal, being an SNS player, to online game, developing all kinds of things that could make money in the short term. We really focused on Chinese search. That's why we got here. So during this very recent financial crisis, I immediately recall that what we did during the internet bubble time and after bubble, how we solved the problem and survived and stripped. So we actually use a similar approach during the last couple of years. We really focused on what we good at. We tried to innovate, come up with better technology, better user experience, and better execution on things that we are good at. Therefore, a couple quarters of bad time went by and by do started to react, celebrate, and we were able to deliver good financial results to our investors. So let me give you a little more color on the innovation we did in the Chinese search space. This is a very popular product called Post Bar. If you read Chinese, you can try this. It's essentially a query-based community or in today's term, it's social search. If you think about this, a good analogy is Twitter. On Twitter, you follow people. And on Post Bar, you follow topics. Anyone who type in a query will be brought to a dedicated message board that you can publish any message. You can ask questions. You can answer other people's questions and so on and so forth. So it's being very popular. It was launched in December of 2003, it's being quite a long time. And now it represents more than 10% of my total traffic. Here I showed an example when you type in Stanford, which is a rare query in China in its English form, but you see that there's a dedicated community about this. People talk about Stanford there on Baidu. We have a similar product or product with the social flavor called Baidu Nose. It's a question answering service. Being Baidu user can post a question on that platform. And because we reached a more than 300 million users, someone knows the answer of your question and the question can quickly be answered or the problem can quickly be solved. And we also have a product called Baidu Encyclopedia. It's right now the largest online Chinese Encyclopedia. About a year ago, we started a project on Aladdin. It's really a technology initiative that's aimed to index the dark web or the hidden web. Because according to computer scientists, right now the conventional search engines only indexed about 1% of the information on the internet. The rest 99 is so-called the dark web. They are not easily accessible by following the links. We came up with this idea that we open up the interface so that people who owns the data, who owns the content can submit it to us and we will integrate into our search results. For example, in Facebook, but in China there are a number of Facebook-like services. Some of them are very popular. One of them is called Xiao Nian. It's really started with the college students. It's real identity. We had a partnership with them. They submit their data about their people, their users to us. Baidu users can easily find information related to that. Those kinds of information are not easily accessible by following links or using the traditional search engine technology. There are lots of applications or data sources that are being integrated into this platform. Baidu will be able to find more and more information than anyone else. Going forward we think the search box will become something different. We call it box computing. It's our vision for the future of computing. Why? This is a search box that every Chinese is familiar with. But when you look at people's needs, people are typing on kind of queries in this box. For example, a great end history. Work time find a girlfriend in Beijing. How do I fix my hack? What kind of college is good? It's a good match for a frail introverted guy like myself. So you can tell that people have very high expectations about Baidu or about the search engine. They're typing all kinds of things, all kinds of needs. Originally, we thought its information needs only. We just need to find a webpage that contains the query word. But it's actually not. Outreach consumers have very, very high expectations about or about a search engine. Then I look at all the other non-search applications on the internet. A Yahoo Finance page, you see a search box or a box on a very prominent page. Facebook, there are boxes. Twitter, a search box in the most prominent position. Everything is about search. But every search box is kind of different. The function is different. Now for Amazon UI in a shopping mode and for Twitter, there's a box that you can type in up to 140 characters to publish your status. There are all kinds of different boxes or the purpose for those boxes are different. Then I start to think, is there any way that we can save the consumer's effort and integrate everything, every function, every application, every information needs, every user's wishes into one box? This is also the classification of user's needs in our search box. It could be information oriented, it could be a dialogue, it could be some kind of tools, request function or dictionary or computing request. If we integrate all this kind of request or this kind of consumer needs into one box, that should be a magic box, that is called box computing. When a request is entered into this box, we do all kinds of semantic analysis, behavioral analysis, intelligent interaction with the user, then a massive computing and figure out what the user really wants. Once that's clear, we will send it to the necessary application, be it a search engine or an NMR software or a stock search or shopping or a front-finder anything that can be plugged into this kind of platform. We have implemented a number of the applications. If you ask what is today's lunar date, we will come up with a calendar with the lunar dates. If you're looking for a piece of software by DuHuy, it's an instant messenger software we delivered. We will show that to you. If you're looking for a beautiful girl, this is the one that, well, not only show you the pictures, but it's got a flash application that you can browse through and it also automatically rotate. To in schedule, you will be prompted by the newer boxes from where to where we understand this kind of user intent. Then there's a lot of computation going on to figure out what's the right answer. We've had a lot of submissions from the third application. This is a movie showing a schedule from a third party. This is the stock quote. This is an NMR software. It doesn't need to show you the search without. It's just to ask you, do you want to run the NMR software? So when you group all kinds of information into one box, you can find that box computing efficiently connects an NMR user request with the application providers. In the future, when you power out a terminal, a laptop, a PC, a network, or a cell phone, immediately instantly you see a box. You don't wait two minutes for Windows to boot up. You don't need to launch a browser and type in URL address. You only see this and immediately see this. Whatever you want to do, check your email, publish tweets, or shopping, or whatever. It can be solved the bag with one box. Everyone off, you know, it takes time to learn how to use Windows. It takes time to learn how to use Mac. But nobody needs to teach you how to use the search. It's so easy. It's so instant. That's why I think the future should be like this. Now, finally, a few words about China. I think there are currently lots of opportunities in China. It's a large growing market. So I think the economics already predict that the Chinese economy will grow at 8% or better for this year, which is probably the most challenging year in the recent history for the world economy. And we have, like I mentioned, a lot of internet users, 338 million by last June. There are about double that amount of mobile phone users in China and still growing very, very quickly. Lots of the growing demand and booming tech industry founded by Silicon Valley VCs, there are lots of things you can do in terms of technology. And our engineers in Silicon Valley almost all have a dream to use the technology to change the world. I think China would be a very good test bet for that. Another very unique thing for China is that for this chart at the bottom, you can tell that there are more than 7,000 engineering graduates each year, engineering meaning computer science related engineering. So the talent pool there is huge. But many of them are not so experienced. When I started this company back almost 19 years ago, I started to recruit talents, recruit engineers. And I wrote in the job description that requires five plus years of related experience. Then I found that I couldn't find anyone in China because nobody at that time really focused on technology. Multinational companies are really higher engineering students to do pre-sales, to do technical support. There's little research, little development, little innovation at that time. So we were forced to train the students to train the engineers to become more experienced in developing innovative products. But that's where the opportunities are. If you have same better ways of managing engineering team, this is a very good space you can be in. You can really manage a lot of people. There are a lot of people that can do work. If you have a more efficient way to manage a large crowd of engineers, you can be very competitive in the technology world. Well this is the real purpose I'm here. I do outcomes talents like you. So what kind of people we like? We like people who fit in our culture. And we like people who is competent, who can do the job that we require them to do. And more importantly, we like people who have the desire and ability to learn quickly. Because this is a fast-changing market. It's a fast-changing industry. It's very exciting. But if you think you know everything you don't need to learn, you don't belong to us. I always need to learn. Everyone from our company needs to be ready to learn new things almost on a daily basis. So that's very important. What's our culture? It's simple and reliable. Simple means there's no politics, there's no letter, no differences between CEO and an average engineer on the surface. And reliable means everyone is competent. They can deliver the job that's assigned to him or her. They are very smart, they are intelligent. They can be counter. So that's the culture of Baidu. This is one of the most frequently asked questions. What's your advice to end up north? To the young people? I'll say find what you like and find what's really good at. Once you find it, you do it and stick with it. You are very likely to be successful. Thank you all. Thank you, Robin. I'm Steve Blank and I'm teaching MSNE 278. I'm a 278 student here at Rijahann. For those who don't know, 278 is the class that surrounds 472 this year. It's a three credit course. We analyze each one of the company, ETL speakers companies. We look at their business model which today could be summarized as world domination through box computing. I believe. And then try to understand through some questions both here and in the class, is how do they get here? And I think for an entrepreneur, that's some of the most interesting questions as you typically see the speakers as they are. But what's really interesting is the journey that got them here. So we've asked our class and in fact, for those of you in the audience, you should know that the 278 students get the first three questions of every ETL lecture. And I'm going to ask Robin the first three, which is the best of my students' questions. So Robin question one is, think back to the first few years of I do. What were the three strategy decisions or pick any number that you now recognize in hindsight were both pivot points or inflection points that really changed the trajectory of the company? Sure. That's a very good question. It's very critical for any startup. I think when I reflect on the first to come up years of I do with operation, I think there are three things that's very critical. First, as you know, we started at the height of Internet bubble. When we brought 1.2 million US dollars back to China, it was like peanuts, compared to a lot of other Internet startups in China. And our engineers constantly hear from other friends working for other Internet companies in Beijing. They live in the most flashiest office spaces in Beijing. And their salary is increased three times a year. But our engineers working a three-star hotel, not very flashy, not on the spotlight. And I only promised them to reach their salaries twice a year. So they thought, why if the company is so great, if we have such a bright future, why you don't do a better job for your employees than the other Internet companies? It was a tough call for me. I really thought as an entrepreneur, as a startup, you don't really need to, you really cannot spend money like hell without thinking about tomorrow. So the first critical decision I made is that when I wasted money 1.2 million, I told our investors that money would last for about six months. But when I actually started to spend the money, I told my people, we need to spend this over the next 12 months. We cannot just run off our money six months later. What happens was six months later, Internet bubble bursted. It was much, much harder to reach money. But I was not worried because I still have more than half of the cash in my bank account. So I started to talk to the VCs and asking for 10 million at a very, very difficult time during Internet history. Getting off the VCs passed on that opportunity and we were to expense it. We only had about 20 people at that time. So if you divide by 10 million, that's a lot of money for each employee, especially some many of them haven't really graduated from college. It's quite really an achievement for them. So I think the first critical decision I made is don't spend money as you promised to your investors. The second critical decision is during the summer of 2001, Internet industry was in a very difficult time as that period. And we gradually realized that this company cannot really survive if we stick with the backend technology providers saying. So I made the decision to switch gear and become a consumer oriented search site. The risk for that is you basically compete, start to compete with every single one of your customers. We pay you money, we had a lot of very famous, very prominent customers. But all of a sudden we started to compete with everyone of them. It's quite risky. We had a lot of arguments within the management, within the board and among the investors. And I finally decided that's the way to go. Because if we don't do that a year from now, I don't see the company that was in revenue and I don't really see the future of this company. So we made that decision and moved on. This decision is also hard to make because when you are a backend technology provider, it's like selling a piece of commodity, you just need to be as good as everyone else on the market. When you become, when you decide to become a front end consumer oriented service, you really need to be better than your competition. Not just a little bit better, but significantly better than your competition because you are a late-comer. There are already a number of Chinese search services on the market. In order to stand out, you really need to come up with a much better technology, much better product and much better user experiences. So that's the risk I took, but I'm really glad I took that risk. Now, Baidu has become one of the best-known Chinese brands in the world because of that decision. The third decision I made, I actually also mentioned that was Project Blitzon. Shortly after we decided to become a consumer brand, I realized that our technology was not as good. So I went back to engineering and told them, okay, guys, we need to work harder. And I'm not under CEO. Don't consider me as CEO. Consider me as your project manager. You guys are engineers. You are used to come to the office 10 a.m. in the morning. No. Starting from today, you need to come 9 a.m. in the morning and have a meeting with me. And I'm holding meetings twice a day with these engineers and pushing them to move faster and come out and meet better quality search services. I did that for about 10 months of period and that resulted in a better or the best Chinese search technology. So I think that's the three very critical decisions I made during the early days of Baidu. Thank you, Robin. In the time I'll just ask one more for the class and then we'll open it up to the rest of the audience. But what is it about Baidu in the Chinese search market that's allowed Baidu to become much more successful than Google and Yahoo and China? Specifically what is it that American companies back both then and now still don't understand about China that you think you do and they don't? I think there are a lot of misconceptions about this question. There are very successful American companies in China, Intel, Cisco, Microsoft. They have been in China for a very long time. They figured out how to do business in China and they have been quite successful. But Internet companies are a little bit different. There are three reasons for that. First is that during the 90s I think the Chinese IT market was very, very small. Nobody paid attention to that. But during the past decade I think with the Internet coming to China that the market gets larger and larger. Chinese economy gets larger and larger. The opportunity, the potential for that market has become very meaningful to a lot of people. Therefore it's a fast growing market. It's growing very, very quickly much faster than the world average. For example, when I returned to China I remember we had less than 10 million Internet users and today we have more than 338 million Internet users. So during the past 10 years the market actually changed very quickly very dramatically. American companies did not realize that in the early days. This thought, okay, the amount of online information grows about 50% per year. I'll grow my index by 50% per year. But in fact, if you pay attention to China, the amount of Chinese information online triples every year. And we triple our index every year. So that gives our users or the Chinese Internet users impression that if you cannot find anything the other search engines you may be able to find it by do. If you cannot find it on by do, you cannot find it anywhere else. So that's just one example of showing how quickly the market is. If you are not close to that market you are missed a lot of opportunities. The second reason is that although by do is perceived as a Chinese company like many other NASDAQ listed folks, Sina, Sohu, Nadi, Shenda. But they are almost 100% funded by US businesses, many of them are Silicon Valley based. This kind of money actually helped a lot in the development of Internet market in China. As many of you know, Chinese people are very entrepreneur. They really want to make a difference. They are hardworking. Once they are married with the C money, it's very competitive. So the Internet space in China has become very, very competitive. This is different from many other sectors. In the traditional sectors, American companies are basically competing with state-owned enterprises. They move very slowly. They don't have the right incentive structure. But in Internet, it's very different. It's like everyone knows everyone and they all have the right incentive structure to become successful. The third reason is that Internet companies, be it American or otherwise, are generally very young. Young companies usually do not plan very for the very long term. Sometimes they are not patient enough. They try, they lost a lot of money a couple years later, five years later, they say, okay, I give up. I have enough challenges in my domestic market. I don't want to deal with this thing. So that happened to a number of American and American companies. I think that's the three most important reasons for what happened in the Internet space in China. Thank you, Robin. Those of you in the room, I could almost bet there's somebody here who else would like to ask Robin a question. And if you would, there are two microphones here. So when don't we form lines? Just stand up. When don't we start right over here and then we'll ping back and forth. So line up behind that mic and this mic, first come first serve. Okay. Ready? Robin, given the rate of Chinese enterprises investment in the US, does Biden have any plan to expand in the US such as a research center in the Silicon Valley or even the M&A situation? All right. Sure. You know, for the past almost ten years, we almost exclusive the focus down Chinese search space. Only a couple of years ago, we decided to expand outside of China and launch a Japanese search service in the early part of 2008. Our approach is to do each market one by one and design product according to the specific needs of that market. Right now, we are not ready to get into the US or English search market, but we understand that Silicon Valley is a center of innovation and we would be very open to look at the startup companies or new technologies. But I'm not a believer of having a separate research team at a remote location. I think the efficiency does not justify the cost. Thank you. Let's take this side and then back over there. Robin, thanks. I found the engineering and the products that you've described here. You've clearly captured the imagination of the Chinese market. And I think part of that story, my understanding is part of that story is that you very aggressively marketed yourself. And interestingly, a lot of that marketing has been bideu versus some of these American companies. And it's very clever. It's very interesting. I'd like you to tell a little bit about how that strategy came about and how that came together for you. Yeah. Okay. It's yet another misconception. You know, for those of you who are familiar with Internet search space, you understand that traffic is gold. It's very, very expensive to acquire. It's like Google Microsoft. They spend lots, lots of money to buy traffic from partners, from syndication partners and distribution partners. Therefore, it's not a winner for them or for us to think about why don't we spend 100 million to market us so that we can have more traffic. The correct answer is it doesn't work. Now, matter how much money you spend, you just cannot really economically, meaningfully, to add traffic to your site. But we are a consumer oriented company and we need to establish our brand, establish a perception about our brand. In the early days, I was very afraid of associating bideu with Chinese-made product because in most people's mind, making China means low quality, cheap in price. And I didn't want to be associated with that. But right before the company won public, we faced a difficult question. How do we tell the American investors that buy do does a better job? We saw and saw then we came out with the idea, okay, it's easy to convince them by do understand Chinese better. So we designed this strategy and came out with a number of marketing initiatives to tell the investors and maybe the general public by do has a better understanding of the Chinese language and Chinese culture. That's why we are doing a better job. So it's mostly for the IPO. It's not really designed to increase the traffic of bideu. Thank you. Hi, my name is Stanley and I'm a graduate business school student. And I know bideu started as a startup in China about 10 years ago and to my very limited knowledge, I know it's really hard to attract top tailors from top universities as a startup when competing with international companies like IBM or things like that. How was bideu able to attract top tailors and has the situation in China changed today? Like will the top student from top university join startup or not? Well time has really changed. Today I think companies like bideu really are capable of offering competitive compensation packages to top talents. Search is very, very hard area. Lots of people want to get into this area. And I think no matter how much money you spend on talent, it's well worth it if you can increase your traffic share by 1%, that's a lot of money almost for a very long time for forever. So we are very willing to offer a very competitive package and we are really targeting the top 5% students in the top 10 schools in China and talents around the world. Hi, Robin. So given that obviously that American market and the Chinese market are very different, what do you think one kind of key point or advice that a Chinese company like yourself could give to an American rising company or vice versa? What could an American company give an advice to China that they wouldn't be able to take from their experiences in their own market? I think my advice to the American companies is that you really need to be there. You really need to have a presence first in order to understand what's going on there. I hear this a lot. Many of the Chinese has multinational companies. Their main job is to communicate with the heck with her, what happened, what should we do about this market. There are lots of differences as you mentioned so you really need to let the heck understand what's going on there. I think that would be my advice to American companies with an interest in going to China or who are already in China. For American companies I think it's about innovation, it's about systematic approach of doing business. I think Chinese need to learn. Hi, my name is Rebecca and I'm a first year applied physics master student. Being originally from China, I have some questions about China I would like to ask you. As we may know, China has different policies on many things, especially the internet. I wonder how those policies help or have hindrance on your companies and how would you suggest other companies to overcome them? You know, internet is new. It's not only new to China, it's also new to the world. Every day you encounter new problems and the legal system really lacks. A lot of cases something happened and there's no law governing the behavior of those new things. Being in the internet long enough, I'm seeing many examples like that. But as an entrepreneur, I'm not really afraid of anything new, anything that's changing, anything uncertain. We are just used to that. Anything happens, we are just trying to figure out what happened and figure out a solution to that. In this sense, I think China is not different from many other markets. You just need to be close to that market. You need to understand the market environment. You need to understand the regulatory environment. You need to keep a good dialogue, good communication with your users, with your customers, with the government officials, with all the stakeholders. Thank you. We'll take one more question. Hi. My question is, I think the million dollar question here is, how do foster, how to build Silicon Valley outside the United States in China and how to foster an entrepreneurial culture in China? I think as you said, Chinese people are very entrepreneurial, but how do we have a more systematic way education system build to encourage this culture? So what has by do done to foster this culture? It's not a million dollar question. It's a trillion dollar question. I think many of the Chinese are very eager to find out what it takes to form a Silicon Valley in China, especially for the government officials. During the past 30 years, China maintained a very high growth rate in terms of GDP. It has become a very large economy in the world. But the problem is that they primarily relied on cheap labor, cheap product manufacturing to get here. I think a lot of people, especially the Chinese leaders, the decision makers, realized that that's not going to last very long. We need to innovate. We need to have more value added in the Chinese economy or in the GDP composition. That's why many of them are thinking really very hard of how to foster entrepreneurship, how to encourage innovation. If you talk to any of the local government officials, Beijing, Shanghai, Xinjiang, they are all very eager to foster entrepreneurship to open up those experimental zones so that you can get cheap rent or free rent or even government start up funding so that entrepreneurs can start to realize those dreams. But it's not an easy task. Silicon Valley is very unique. I don't know what it takes to replicate that in China, but I certainly hope one day there will be a place in China that looks like Silicon Valley. Given that we have the largest internet population, it's likely that we will be able to encounter new problems before American people encounter. Therefore we have the chance to innovate and to solve those problems. So I think there are hopes for that. Thank you so much. Thank you.
