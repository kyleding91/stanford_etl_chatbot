 You are listening to the Draper Fisher-Jurvenson entrepreneurial thought leader seminar brought to you weekly by Stanford Technology Ventures program at Stanford University School of Engineering. So let's give Pam a big welcome to Stanford University, Pam. How can they? Thank you very much. In 2004, AgreQuest won the top 100 private company award and I noticed that my talk, 10-minute talk, was sandwiched in between two internet security companies and I was groaning and saying, oh my god, the whole program is is people aren't going to be interested at all in what I have to say and the conference organizers said, oh no, we all have to eat and that is true and all of you should be very interested in what's happening in our food system because it's quite dynamic and there's a lot of changes and I'll touch on some of that today and of course tell you some of the lessons that I learned being an entrepreneur. My major goal since I was about eight so I'm a little bit weird. I was interested in bugs since I was young and studied entomology my entire career, entomology being the study of insects and I grew up in a family that was organic gardeners, 40 acres in Connecticut, very green family, my father's an energy efficiency expert and my mother's a master gardener who does everything organic and so I decided I wanted to have a career pursuing product, developing products that were going to be safer than chemical pesticides and I started my career from graduate school getting a PhD in entomology and then went to write out of graduate school to Monsanto company and a very exciting program I was allowed to start up to look for new solutions for insect control and I was pretty much given a blank sheet of paper and said just find something new and had a really good time there for seven years but Monsanto ultimately decided they wanted to pursue genetically engineered plants, engineering the insect control proteins and the genes that code for those proteins into plants which have become very successful and my group switched to that and was very involved in doing that but I actually was more interested in looking for things that you could spread microbes like bacteria and fungi that you could actually spray on plants to kill insects and plant diseases and so forth rather than the engineering route so I got a call from a Danish company called Novo Nordisk and they said well we'd like you to start up a company somewhere in the US and we ultimately decided on Davis California to start it up and so I was given the money to start up a company as a wholly owned subsidiary looking for novel solutions for insect control that were based on naturally occurring microorganisms that could be fermented like you're making wine and beer in the tanks and the reason they wanted to do this is because they had excess tank capacity at the time wanted to fill those tanks and hired a big consulting firm who said diversify and so they wanted to get into all these new businesses of which we were one and so we started up a program looking for naturally creating microorganisms that you could ferment that you could spray out as pesticides and after five years they hired it they were having some real problems in their core businesses and that they actually they didn't anticipate that they were going to have a tank shortage after five and so they couldn't didn't have enough tanks to meet their main core businesses of industrial enzymes so they hired I think it was Booz Allen that time and and Booz Allen said well you've diversified too much please sell all your ancillary businesses and get back to your core so we were sold in 95 and I took three scientists who are still at Agrequest as the founding scientific team and then started up raised about five hundred thousand dollars from friends and families and some large farmers and we were on our way well why would you think you could find pesticides from nature well the drug discovered the drug companies have forever been looking for drugs from the rainforest and more than 50% of your drugs are from natural sources so I had done this at both companies Monsanto and Nova Nordisk they let me as I said do pretty much whatever I wanted so I actually took the drug model looking for extracts of plants and microorganisms testing them against insects and plant pathogens fungi molds that that kill plants and weeds and we found quite a number of things that were very interesting but both companies didn't pursue this area and I said well I have to get back to this it's it worked in drugs it's going to work in pest management and everybody wants to be green consumers don't want chemical pesticides in their food the global pesticide market is over 30 billion dollars it's well it's actually about 30 billion dollars there's some perturbations this is all weather-based this is where there was a drought in Europe but overall if you look at the market since 1999 it's not growing at all and that's because a number of chemical products are being phased out by various governments around the world and if you notice you can get food it's now taken for granted you can get asparagus from Peru offseason when it's not in season in California you can get grapes from Chile because of the global movement of food the the exporters do not want chemical pesticides on that food it is regulated by law the level of chemicals that you can have at the time of harvest products like ours you can spray right up to harvest and there's no chemical residues you can't do that with chemicals so there's a real compelling reason to switch to products like ours the global market for organic food is growing very fast this is the US market it's about 14 billion and growing at 20% per year organic food has been in the media quite a bit and but what it is is food that is produced without the use of synthetic chemicals or without the use of genetically engineering of crops so it is natural or naturally derived ways to but it's it's more than that it's actually a whole system and philosophy of growing your crop but the rules are under the national organic standards for the US Department of Agriculture is no synthetic and genetically engineered inputs California is a leader in natural pesticides or biopesticides like the ones that agroquest in my new company is making growing very fast as well organic food is becoming mainstream consumers perceive organic as healthier and there is a growing body of scientific research that supports the health and environmental and taste benefits of organic food even research from Stanford has recently came out made of explosion and showed some of that purchases they crossed their go there it's no longer an elite white rich female who's buying organic food it crosses all demographic and ethnic groups and income groups whole foods the big organic food retailer has stated they want to grow from 4 to 12 billion by 2010 and then if you walk into a safe way these days you'll see their big O brand for their organic private label line all the other grocery stores are have their own private label line now like stop and shop and so forth big global big US food distributor multi billion dollar food distributor has because they want to source globally they have now set up standards and those global suppliers have to meet those standards for sustainability and organic production and Walmart is becoming the largest organic retailer they've seen a high growth area and is now are now driving very fast into this into this area as well which has a lot of implications well what is what is this going to do to hold a lot of growers in California are switching to growing organic like Drisco's is the largest strawberry grower in the US controls probably 80% of the strawberries they've stated they're going to get to 80% organic by you know by four years from now that's because whole food paid whole foods pays them a lot more than traditional supermarkets to grow organic but what if Walmart comes in and drives the price of organic down what is that going to do to whole food so there's a big debate whether these are totally different customers and and it's and it's not going to matter and they're not going to mix and so whole foods will do just fine and the farmer selling them to do just fine but we'll have to watch that one and see what happens so the company that I found it in 1995 AgroQuest discovers develops markets effective environmentally friendly natural products and I'll explain briefly how we do this I don't certainly don't have time to get in all the the technical part of it but the keyword is effective when I started AgroQuest I did a market survey of growers and the distributors who sell to growers and they told me that these products are snake oil they don't work we're not going to buy them and I said well what if you buy what if there's a natural product that's effective it's not a snake oil so the whole idea is that there are products that can compete with chemical pesticides in every way shelf life ease of use performance and that's what AgroQuest has focused on and we have proven that you can do that discover these natural things that can work as well as chemicals and provide value the same or better than chemicals so an overview of the company I started at 95 we're headquartered in Davis I bought a manufacturing plant in the year 2000 that's until escalab Mexico we've got 80 employees several products on the market they're all patented and it says a proprietary business we compete with Bayer and Sanjenta Dupont Dow B.S.F. and they are very big multi-billion dollar companies that put a lot of money into developing new chemical pesticides raised 60 million of capital and sales now I left AgroQuest March 31st AgroQuest is now moved from discovery and development and has been as ramping up sales very quickly more than doubling doubling or more than doubling sales and I accidentally just start up a new company which I'll talk a little bit about just briefly just like just like drug discovery companies do penicillin from a mold your antibiotics from micro organisms we go out and collect compost dead bugs leaves flowers bring them back to the laboratory and find the microorganisms that live there and then understand the chemistry the natural products the compounds that are at excreted like these by these microbes optimize those in fermentation so that every batch in our plant in Mexico is producing a defined amount of this pesticidal compound in there and that way having that very defined high level of that compound has made our products better than what traditional natural products these snake oils a company would find a micro they just grow it any old way and then every batch would be very inconsistent and get a bad reputation in the marketplace then through a process of process development and commercial development go out and do field trials test on the actual farmers fields see if it works and get it to market the plant we have in Mexico is where we produce all our product and I'm actually looking back on it this is the best decision I made to buy this plant I bought it because I couldn't find tank capacity that would be the price that we needed to make a good business the contract manufacturing would quote us prices that would put us into a negative margin and we weren't going to make any money this so I hired a consultant who looked all over the world for for something for us to ferment and found this plant that was for sale from Abbott it was an antibiotic plant and they actually convinced them to loan us the money to buy it and that way because we had almost no revenue at the time so 208,000 square foot plant on 15 acres it was a it was a seven million dollar purchase it was a big big purchase for a company that had no revenue and but Abbott loaned us the money and it's it's been excellent because we have a team down there that has fermented 500 runs so that's individual fermentation runs and it had only one spoiled run in five years it's been a remarkable record and so what you do is in these big tanks like you're making wine and beer but in this case it's a much faster process after you put the microbe in the tank after 48 hours or 36 hours you harvest it and then you can either package it as a liquid like this in a little jug or you can dry it and package it as a powder and so instead of a chemical being sprayed out by the farmer they're spraying out a living microbe and the compounds that were harvested with the microbe that were excreted in that tank that are causing the pesticidal activity so the product is composed of both the microbe and that natural compound and so if then they put you put in a spray tank and you're on your way spray over the crop just like you would a chemical but it's a living thing with those compounds in there now one of the things that I did which actually everybody told me was crazy at the time was I wanted to get a product into Walmart and I had a friend who said he knows this ex group of ex Walmart buyers who actually helps companies get into Walmart so I contacted them and we I went to Bentonville which is their headquarters and and pitched Walmart and the Walmart Garden pesticides garden buyer he for the whole garden section including pesticides said I think that may be in five years or three three years or five years or seven years we're probably not going to be selling any chemicals in Walmart so I better start looking at this organic natural stuff it's growing very fast now I visited Lowe's and Home Depot and they said we like our chemicals our customers like our chemicals we don't we don't want your stuff they don't work it snake oils so I was intrigued that Walmart Big Bad Walmart was the one that took our product in first this was the first certified organic pesticide ever in the retail chain called serenade garden disease control in 2,400 stores now being sold and so it was it Walmart actually walked the buyer actually walked me through the process so I came in with a mock-up of the bottle spray painted and you know and and and he actually told me what he didn't didn't like on the label and at first said serenade garden fungicide and he said the average housewife coming into Walmart hasn't been know what a fungicide is please change it to disease control he told me what colors so interestingly took the time over several months to get it the way they wanted I mean it's obviously a very small product for a Walmart but now they've started a whole organic line and 20 environmental groups put out a press release chastising home-deep one Lowe's for not having any organic products in their garden line and I was and Walmart wasn't named so it was maybe some PR as well that helped Walmart take it into the store so the the product that serenade product here which is the same as what's in in the ready to use for the for the Walmart is actually a bacteria that we found in a peach orchard in Fresno County California we had a small investors a farmer who noticed that he never saw Brown brought in his field of peaches they never brought it and his neighbors had Brown Rock but he didn't so we collected a little sample under the tree brought it back to the lab and I had a very good microbiologist who I'd worked with for five years prior at my previous company and she found a bacterium the microbe that lived what's living there and it was warding off everything else on the petri plate that we had and we brooded up in a little flask in the lab because we didn't have a fermenter or tank or anything and went out and I had a friend who was the head of R&D for galo vineyards up in their North Coast vineyards and said could I spray it out please and see if this works and spray it on some vines and it did a beautiful job of controlling powdery mildew which is on the left and you can see it's very clean grapes and also bunch rot and we used that data that one little test from galo to raise the first round of venture capital when the venture capital has said but I was pitching said well what have you got if you proof of concept well there it was and now it's said this year of projecting about 17 million in sales and we have had no performance failures so it's not a snake well after more than three and a half million pounds sold the key is to breaking down those skepticism about these types of products was to get it on the farm demonstrating with the farmer is this product in your program going to do something at least as good or better than what your chemical only program is and there's a lot of gatekeepers who prevented us from getting on that farm there's distributors who have pest control advisors who no you don't want to we don't want to get you on the farm the stuff is snickle and there's also university which really surprised me was university researchers the land grant institutions who said stand up at grower meetings and say these things these products don't work all the efforts that we went and trying to build the the good the good data and so forth would be ruined in one grower meeting so I'll talk a little bit about how we overcame those barriers with those academics in a minute but key was getting it on the farm and demonstrating and it's true of any business that demo was really critical it's now approved in many countries around the world and that's adding a lot of countries so we sell we're the manufacturer we sell to a distributor a united agri products or in ten co's group and they sell to the grower but these gatekeepers were trying to keep us from getting to the grower this was a really tough problem it was also a really tough problem it was a really difficult problem for our salespeople the salespeople I hired these these distributors they like people who've been in the business for 20 30 years that they know they're not going to they're not going to sell a company's product that they don't it's just brand new they don't know anybody so we had to hire people from the cinjenta's bsps of the world and so forth and it turns out that those a lot of those people are used to taking one or a half a percent market chair away from each other every year they didn't know how to take a product substitute our product for a chemical it's a very different sale and we write required the salesperson to be a lot more aggressive and one of my distributors here said you need to hire hungry dogs those people who we could who can make that sale and wrench that product that chemical product out of the grower's hands and put your product in there and that was a really really tough sell so at one point I actually replace the entire sales team and hired a new one and we figured out that the key component in hiring these types of people was if they had an entrepreneurial experience in their past they started up a company or they had a family member a close family member it could be a you know a parent or a aunt or uncle or something that had a family business was an entrepreneur took some risk so I could then now in the interviewing process find those salespeople who are going to be able to make that sale when the other ones couldn't do it and that was really key so being an entrepreneur especially in this business where you're changing the paradigm of how farmers produce their food with with these products and substituting one product for another the what we found is that the academic scientists would test products in an artificial situation so that actually introduce insects or molds to the field on a very high level in a little test plot and then test my product side by side with the chemical and it was totally artificial the farmers don't do that at all the farmers used lots of different products in cocktails so they'll mix five products in a tank and spray it out a fungicide an insect killer a weed killer and maybe even two fungicides at the same time or they'll rotate products so they'll have a program to prevent insects and mold the fungus from developing resistance and to the chemical so the chemicals will still work they rotate from one chemical to another so they never use anything stand alone but all the government work was done I mean so all the academic work was done with stand alone very artificial situations so I actually formed a group called the biopesticide industry alliance in the year 2000 I called all my colleagues in the industry and said let's get a trade group together and start lobbying to change some of these things which we did which it's now a nonprofit with an executive director and dues paying and has about 29 members and we got the environmental protection agency and the US Department of Agriculture to fund a program they always say that if you want someone to you want someone in the university at least in our land-grant university to do something you they go where the money is so so they they seeded and put out a lot of grants and as part of the grant proposal the grant proposal they had to if they sent in a grant proposal that a grant application that had them stand alone side by side immediately rejected the whole idea was that they would get money for doing on-farm research where it would integrate these types of bio products just like the farmer was doing in a more practical way that completely changed the attitude of these types of university professors extension specialists they call them when they saw that they started getting really good data on the farm they saw these products were getting when you integrated one of these bio products in the farm was getting higher yield at least at least as good control and even often a better quality one of the farmers I met in Mexico when I was down there talking to customers said he saw that when you break this chemical cycle it's like a plant's on steroids all the time and so it's chemical chemical chemical chemical and then eventually the health of the plant poops out when if you have this break with a biological product in there it can give a little break in the plant health increases and time and time again we see the growers tell us that there's higher yield and higher quality when they incorporate our products in when I started AgroQuest the EPA Environmental Protection Agency approves our products told me it would take 12 months to get my product approved so I put that in the business plan you know raise money and all the investors are waiting for the products to be approved in 12 months the first product serenade took 28 months the second product took 48 months this this is a disaster to a business but that you have get revenue and the whole industry was on its knees because of these unpredictable timelines what we found out was that the EPA which is still true is very very susceptible to political influences changes of administration changes the timelines and so it was impossible to predict and how can you have a business of the business plan where you never know when your products can be approved this was this was a disaster and so we got our biopesticide industry alliance together we teamed up with the big companies Bayer BSF etc and we actually went to Congress and got a law pass to change it that's the only way that's the only way we felt we could do it and in 2004 we passed the Pestaside Registration Improvement Act now it takes 18 months for a new natural pesticide to get to the market on a food crop in 12 months for like turf for flowers non-food crop so now starting out my new company I have a business plan that says I know that in 18 months for a food crop I'm going to get my product approved a huge difference if you're an entrepreneur trying to do something like this already mentioned the the the the barrier the the sales people had to swap out a lot of sales people and the solution was to hire those hungry dogs who were innovators and could take high risk that had an entrepreneurial experience in their background when I when I started Agrequest and predicted the the adoption I had predicted a much steeper adoption curve than it's here so the farmers will they'll never try it for it'll never be full adoption the first year and this is true of any technology that in the first year you've got your early innovators early adopters you know we'll try it on about 20 acres and you've got growers the next year that same grow will try it on a few more acres 300 and what we had figured was the third year would be full adoption this is a the real curve of serenade adoption in fresh market tomatoes in cal in Florida which is our largest market actually and right now it's it's about 40 45% of all the sales and it so it took a much longer was this sort of flat 25% growth here and then a big ramp up in year five and so when I'm starting my new business I said well what can I do to make this curve a lot steeper and get a much faster adoption curve and revenue ramp much much faster and I decided that I would focus on much on on met market needs agrequest products are very good but they're in a highly competitive environment where it's a substitution you have to again wrench the far you have to wrench that product that chemical out from the farmer substitute yours I was gonna I was looking for markets in the new company completely on met needs where there's very little competition right there so changing that adoption curve to get a steeper curve I decided to focus on the single largest cost of organic protection is weed control you can see this is on the left is a very weedy radish field and on the right is one that doesn't have weeds well how do you get that one on the right you hand hoe it is absolutely archaic and so you have to hire laborers to hoe strawberries or any of your high value vegetables all of your fruits and vegetables here here in California and it cost strawberry growers two thousand dollars an acre great growers about six hundred dollars an acre acre to do this sometimes you can go through the rows with tractors and cultivate out the weeds but that's only in crops that are suitable like that like corn or soybeans or so forth so if you add up the cost to us organic growers alone and it's much bigger worldwide it's a half a billion dollar that they're spending on this absolutely archaic way they can't use round up they can't use sprays that you can spray over it so organ so never mind Walmart how's Walmart gonna source all of their organic because this is this is it's just going to be impossible for them to rapidly ramp up organic as fast they want to unless there are better weed control solutions so so the solution that I that that we're working on it at the new company is I know there are these microorganisms that produce these compounds that can kill plants kill weeds so I'm setting up a program where you can actually isolate the microorganisms that produce compounds that kill weeds and I know they're out there so it's not a matter of if it's when so it's just it's wet it's just looking at the microbes enough microbes from from interesting places based on our previous experiences to find these things so this is very very exciting for me doing this so to wrap up I'm just going to talk about some of the lessons more of the lessons learned I exited AgroQuest with not as much equity as I think I should well actually everybody says it not just me should have for what I built and another's a number of reasons for that which I don't need to get into now but first of all get a really good lawyer that's really important it really is someone who can really give you options and negotiate really hard on your behalf and start thinking strategically very early if you're gonna have to do fit raise 50 million in capital or 30 or whatever how are you going to down the road protect yourself and your early investors and your your shares in the company and I'd like for example I didn't have an employment contract until series G and I should have had one much earlier so and so getting that really good lawyer is very important also you always want to be in a position of strength when you're negotiating after we had filed our S1 with the SEC to go public and we filed August 3rd 2001 it's really bad timing and I had an investor who said plan for disaster and I was like oh come on what could happen well nine one one happened to obviously you couldn't predict that but nevertheless he was right plan for disaster and so I didn't so we were short on cash and I had you know short on cash and so then you are not in a very good negotiating position when you're short on cash and you're worried about making payroll so the new company you know my my real motto was going to be negotiating from a position of strength and not being a position where and plan for disaster and not being positioned where you have to take whatever money that comes in the door I don't do well with aggressive top dog types who are not who don't see that who don't talk to you on an equal basis or always you're always in a one-down position I just don't do well with those types of people and people who who manage on the basis of fear and very top down and corporate environments I'm Monsanto there were a lot of a lot of people like that at Monsanto and all the companies I've worked for and I just don't do well with those at all and it's very important that I work with people who are extremely fair and high integrity and open communication and open and can and communication communication is really critical I and the type of person who likes to have employees involved in a lot of decision-making and strategic planning and I believe that employees who have a lot of information are more productive employees and are more empowered and that was the case at AgroQuest and it's really important when hiring people for this type of business is do they care about the environment I mean if someone is really a not is a nozzle head and they don't really nozzle head being someone who came from a chemical company and still adheres to really liking chemicals and is just doing it for the job they have to care about the environment and interesting interview question do you recycle and what and what is their answer you can tell when people are faking it so and do they volunteer in the community do they care about something somebody something other than themselves that's really important and I do believe that a diverse workforce definitely leads to leads to better decision-making and higher productivity and that's a real goal of mine as well it's really important to have women in the management team the dynamics of a conversation or a room is very different when you have women more than one woman in a room together I believe it's really important nobody's going to be as passionate about my business as I am because my the graduate school of management students at UC Davis told me I have unreasonable passion for this this business so no one's going to have that as much so I said but you do have to have people who really believe those sales people they had to believe in our product to sell it they couldn't sell it if they just that's just any old product and and I do believe that I need to hire very trustworthy people my husband was injured dislocated the shoulder when I was traveling and they were a group of agro-quest employees that took care of him while I was away and those those are those are really good employees and if you go on an interview and I get if someone enters interviewing with me and I get a handwritten thank you note that person stands out in my mind and I I like I would hire people who have who are of course if they're equally qualified people one gives them sends me an internet note and one sends me a handwritten note and they're equally qualified I would hire the one with a handwritten note because they take the extra time and something personal it's anybody can just flip off an internet note for thanking somebody so a lesson for you is right handwritten thank you notes when you when someone does something nice for you also people who don't return my books or CDs are really you know what are they trust they're not trustworthy I mean a book is sacred to you know CD and these are things that you know of course now you don't CDs are not as much as you download everything but but in the past anyway I already talked about hiring innovative risk-taking people this is very important not just for sales people but also for R&D people it was interesting how little agro-quest very innovative would there would be this this this weird culture developing of people who would who would say no to everything and not want to not want to take risks and and over time I had to introduce a number of innovative innovation exercises to get people to brainstorm and think more innovatively and I don't know whether it's just PhDs are just that way but I was surprised that just being an innovative company didn't mean that people remained innovative and already mentioned about the entrepreneurs with that thank you very much okay quick quick question is a question you said that you have to shift around your entire self-teen and you have to go look for a different type of people and we're good you have a strategy for targeting that those kinds of people or do you just interview with people and just green them we we found that actually we found a really good head hunter who knew the industry really well and knew the pool of sales people and once he worked with us for a while and he understood what we were looking for he pre-screened them and could and ended up that the pool that we got to interview ended up being many more of them with that type of that type of profile yeah oh repeat the question yes okay yes yeah I'm sure there's more questions I didn't stump you all actually talked with venture capitalists who said that right now the state of the art is that you can expect it to be as a non-founding secret or 5% of the company and a 5 vice-president is next to the end of the 1% and the going rate right now is because there's not really much IPO activities more M&A magic members $100 million I've seen this venture capital which just look out and audits and say so you want to be the vice-president of whatever your technology design and finance you can expect to get $1.5 million after 35 years or the board and that's the core taxes so it isn't working your thoughts on what you think is very inequitable and I was personally thought that your first start you're really going to make other people welcome yourself because there's that when you're not on the quantity it's just not clear when you have the skill set to really follow true and accomplish what you said yes the question is about how much equity I made the comment I didn't think I ended up with enough equity and how much equity should someone end up at the CEO and VP's VP levels and the first one first venture is more for making other people wealthy than yourself I would actually because you're an unproven entity I would actually agree that with that that's certainly the second one it'll be quite different but I and to be honest I didn't go obviously didn't do this for the money and so it was always the computing the company first and I maybe was surprised at at the end of the day it wouldn't it wouldn't be what I actually ended up but how new people coming in were compensated relative to what I have so it's more a relative thing that I was I was I was looking at in terms of fairness and so at the end of the day I think you're right though but today I think your numbers are probably accurate yeah a pretty accurate about what what our company that they're the VCs and our company are looking at yeah the 1% for VPs and you said 5% for yeah yeah I think that's that's pretty accurate yeah well it did get good reason he said what our product didn't get good results when testing an academic setting it did get good results but not quite as good as the chemical in every case sometimes it was equal but sometimes it was let's say the chemical would control 90% and ours would be 75 okay yeah yeah yes there was a number of factors and we actually did some tests to try to figure this out why it didn't work as well in the academic hands as ours and it can be very complicated technically the academic scientists would use a backpack sprayer by hand and the farmers use a tractor driven spray rig with different nozzle types and different agitation and what we found is that if a technician an academic lab is could mix up our product in the morning and not get to it until later that afternoon and not agitate it and the chemistry that's in there needs the agitation and so just the different kinds of spraying nozzles and spray rigs would make a huge difference that's something that you don't necessarily see that as much with chemicals but with these types of biological products and the different kinds of chemistry that is in there very different kinds of chemistry that was that was a big factor there was a number of things also the where the plots were situated often the the demo trials for the chemical pesticides would be done in the same location year after year after year so the level of disease molds on the grapes would be a lot lower whereas the untreated or the natural plots where they were testing a lot of snake oils would have a much higher natural level to begin with and so so the the different populations would change the outcomes of there were a number of factors yeah so the design of the of the plots was really was really critical which again led to the the government actually funding a redesign of these types of tests this question you mentioned that you just hire a lawyer early on well a good one I don't really want to yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah would you hire one and are there a way for because I mean lawyers are like seven years trying to you know bootstrap through before you even have funding it's kind of hard to have any advice well how are how are yeah how are yeah how are really should you hire a lawyer and what do you do about funding since your bootstrapping early on for my new company I that one of the first things I'm doing is interviewing lawyers attorneys I I really think it was it's one of the earliest things and yet they're very expensive that's true but I think it's going to be worth worth it in designing what's in the bylaws how you're putting your board of directors together where do you want to be in five years strategically and and how much money and the different rounds and your employment contract all of these things need to be thought out very early on so you can think strategically for the years down the road and plan them at the beginning yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what I'm doing yeah yeah yeah question the back yes we're serenade is actually this oh yes sorry thank you Tom thank you do we have a yes our products popular overseas and we have a strategy for selling internationally this product is registered or version of it is registered in about 17 18 countries right now and our international business is growing very quickly and it's what we found is that where where there's export markets there's a very high demand because as I mentioned earlier you can't spray right before harvest with the chemical because then you're at risk the exporter will be at risk of having chemicals at a higher level than is allowed by law and so countries like Chile where they're exporting to the US Costa Rica they're exporting bananas to to US and EU and so forth those countries where they're an export market are rapid adopters of of our types of products because of that I because they want to minimize the amount of chemical residues at export time yeah Tom what should students consider working in a company like AgroQuest as opposed to Google well okay why why would you what why would you want to work for a company like AgroQuest versus Google let's see the Google maybe they're changing the world but maybe they are but we're we're really changing the world I mean do we want to be do you want to be part of something that is absolutely fundamentally changing the way your food is produced and making people healthier and the environment safer this this is this is what gets people jazzed up about coming to AgroQuest those values again that's one set of values and it is it is amazingly exciting to be changing the way food is produced and I didn't realize how hard it was going to be with AgroQuest over the 11 years but 11 years later it is amazing the change that's happening in agriculture to have Walmart becoming the largest retailer of organic food is unbelievable so that's that's why yeah yeah you can get a bonus question yeah you can get a bonus question okay okay when I start set up AgroQuest the idea was that you couldn't be a one-product wonder and the distribution chain completely ignore ignores any companies that are just one product companies they really like to see a solid company that has multiple products that excites them over the years they can get you make more money off of your product line you really have to so I set up AgroQuest so we'd have a full pipeline of products so serenade is the first one but there's also several others sonata is the second one and is also was introduced last year and is growing and there's several more in the pipeline there's a couple licensed in products one actually one we acquired there's an extract of a Mexican plant called episode that kills aphids and mites and whiteflies and mealy bugs and this little Canadian company entrepreneur and a couple other people took this product this extract of a plant and turned it into a product and it's it's waiting approval at the EPA so that'll be on the market next year and then we licensed in another one that is a fungus found by Dr. Gary Strobel at Montana State University that was found on a bark of cinnamon of a cinnamon tree and it actually is a fungus that produces gases and you can put it in a in the soil and fumigate the ground as an alternative for a very toxic chemical methyl bromine that's being replaced so AgroQuest has a full line of products and that was the idea now is the company going to be sold obviously the investors have to get their money out and the IPO market NASDAQ is just not really open for a company like AgroQuest however there have been five or so ag type companies that have gone public on the London alternative market called the aim as well as Toronto Stock Exchange and also one on the year next in Europe and these companies are companies that have no revenue very little revenue and I don't know you know they're they're they're even at an earlier stage in the AgroQuest yet have gotten amazing valuations in their off public offerings and so as a financing strategy maybe maybe not the initial float on the London aim is going to get the investors liquidity but maybe over time it will but as a financing strategy that would be a very good way to go to go on one of those alternative markets and it's just odd that all of all of a sudden in the last year there have been these Ag there's a bio fertilizer company of a genetic engineered salmon company a couple others oh one that takes puts gas turbines on the farm and cooks manure and comes out with an organic fertilizer I'm on the board of that one just amazing ability to raise money in an alternate way so the idea the lesson here is that be creative and find find ways to solve your funding needs and AgroQuest definitely could get sold to a big company there's plenty of people out there who would be willing who would want to take on this product line definitely another question why why are we not doing the weed project at AgroQuest and why did I leave AgroQuest has so many products and development that it's a resource issue and so has moved from discovery and longer term discovery to development and commercialization so licensing products that are in much later stage to get revenue earlier and to ramp up the products that they already have and when your small company resource limited you can't do everything and so the competency of the company is shifting more to development and commercialization rather than discovery and development and after 11 years at a company a fact I actually probably outlasted most founders most founders don't stay with a company a venture back company as long as I did at least there's a few examples but for the most part and the investors that we brought in wanted it pretty much wanted a transition to a new management so and the company so my role was was changing and it wasn't as entrepreneurial as I would have liked so it wasn't as innovative and entrepreneurial with a company that's shifting to the stage that it is and I wanted to so my role was not what really excited me anymore the role that was that I was being given as the company changed
