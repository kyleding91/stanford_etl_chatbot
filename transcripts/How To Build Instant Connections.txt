 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. It is my great pleasure to introduce you to Ori Broughman, who is an entrepreneur in all different manners. He has been an entrepreneur almost an entire life. He actually went to UC Berkeley as an undergrad and Stanford Business School. And he has been involved with all sorts of ventures from healthy, fast food to political advocacy. But I've got to know him recently because he's an author. And he's written several really fascinating books. His first book he wrote is called The Starfish and The Spider. And it's about leaderless organizations. The second book called Sway is about irrational decision making. And his newest book called Click is about the magic of instant relationships. And I read this book and I was completely taken with it. In fact, the stories and the insights are so interesting and surprising that I start telling the stories to every person I would meet who would listen to me for the next weeks afterwards. So I'm so delighted that he's here today to share these stories with us and without further ado, here's Ori. You may press agent. It's really fantastic being here. I just got back from Kansas where I've been hanging out with the US Army. And kind of an unlikely person to be at the US Army will get into that a little bit later. But peace and conflict studies major at Berkeley and then business here. And when we think about the US Army, we really think that they have a toolset, if you will. And their toolset is very complex. They have helicopters to basically inflict the will upon people. They have cannons. They have basically the best machines available to inflict our way upon the people of the world. And fighting in the US Army instills one of two responses. It's either a fight or flight. And I want to talk to you for a second about fight or flight. I want to talk to you specifically about the biology behind these two. There is a chemical in our brain called cortisol. And cortisol is amongst many others, a stress chemical. And when we get ahead of cortisol, it makes us more amped. It gives us a huge glucose up in our bodies. And it makes us be able to deal with a fight or flight situation. And when you look at fight or flight, this is how it looks like in society. This is how it looks like in history, in military history. But what happens after that cortisol injection, that head of cortisol, it oftentimes makes us feel like this. It's a taxing hormone on us. It makes us feel tired. It's bad on our bones. It's a chemical that afterwards leaves us exhausted. And it's with cortisol in mind that a few months ago, actually several months ago, a general from the Army got in touch with me and said, hey, the right one of my books. And this is the weird thing about writing books. It can be a liberal living in California, almost certain people read their books. And the sky writes me in. And I didn't exactly know who he was. Turns out he is the general who is in charge of leadership for the Army. And he is right now in charge of the entire Army. And he said that they're basically facing a huge problem. And the problem that they're facing is that this is the first time in a very long time that for 10 years, we've had back-to-back combat. People who have been deployed three, four times in the course of 10-year career. And as they come back, how do you create an Army that isn't feeling the effect of cortisol? And cortisol tends to have an effect like post-traumatic stress disorder, problems adjusting. Like, how do you build a trust-based network in the Army? I mean, guards of your politics for a second. Think about the implications that the head of the Army right now is thinking about how do you build a trust-based network? How do you leverage something that the Army isn't known for? Something called soft power. And for the last year, I've gotten to actually have a lot of conversations and I've been meeting a lot of these soldiers and Army officers who've had these combat experiences. People like Keaton, who's a helicopter pilot, served back-to-back tours. People like Elliott, served back-to-back tours 20 years in service. And what we've done and what I just came back from Kansas of all places is we took these guys and put them here. Put them in a circle. And we got them to talk amongst other things about their feelings. And we got them to relate about what it's been like to have these experiences overseas and what it's like to come back. And we got them to relate in what I would argue is a more humane human level. And what we've noticed is that of where we think happens when they get into this circles. There's sort of intimacy. And that's a word you don't oftentimes hear in business. It's not a word you oftentimes hear in the Army that develops. And here you'll see at the very edge there's a chair that's empty. And the reason that chair is empty is because there's a person taking the picture. And the person taking the picture about with me, not a usual suspect in Army circles. This is Kelly. And the thing to know about Kelly is that amongst other things, she practices soft power. Among other things, she's very soft. She's likes to nurture human relationships. And if the Army works on cortisol, Kelly functions, I would say, on a different chemical. Oxytocin. Oxytocin is released primarily when mothers give birth. And what it does is it actually creates an instant trusting relationship. When people are given oxytocin in lab situations, they trust their partners more. When a newborn is born, it's side of vision. It's just a few inches. When you think about that, that's exactly distance from the mother's chest to her eyes. Oxytocin is responsible for those levels of connections. And what I want to talk about a little bit today is about oxytocin. And about how you can have a leadership model that isn't based on traditional cortisol, but it's based on oxytocin instead. This is what oxytocin looks like. For me, this is what oxytocin looks like. This is my wife. I met her seven years ago. It was a blind date. She wasn't big on emailing or talking on the phone, so we just sat across from each other to restaurant. And from the moment I met her, she was absolutely beautiful. And I was obviously taken by her. It wouldn't be. And the moment we connected was when we shared a story about both our mothers being hippies. If you have a name like Ori, you know that your mother was a hippie. It means light. And about how our mothers made homey granola. And we knew right there and then that it was a connection. We knew that this was it. We actually don't exactly know when we decided to get married. And I know this is going broad, but I'll admit it. We don't remember exactly when we decided to get married because we light so much about it. We light to our families. We light to our friends. It was that soon after we met. This is what instant connections and intimacy looks like for me. When we look at it from a historical perspective, we see this as an archetype. Shakespeare talks about it. Romeo and Juliet, act one, scene five. This is Baz Lurman's interpretation of it. I'll show it to you in just a second. The reason I show it to you is because I used to have a crush on Claire Daines. But this captures that level of intensity, that level of finding someone so incredibly drawing from the get-go. I'm not a man. I'm not a man. I'm not a man. I'm not a man. I'm not a man. I'm not a man. I'm not a man. I'm not a man. I'm not a man. So, that did not end well. Let's be clear. When we often think of instant connections, we think about being very impulsive. You meet someone and it's not a rational thing to do. I wrote a book about decision-making. It's not a rational thing to do. It seems like one of those impulses that people follow and bad things happen. And when we decided to write this book, my brother and I, we decided to look at really both the science behind it. But one of the questions that we had is what happens when Romeo and Juliet were 12? What happens when grown-ups, if you will, have that same kind of connection? We started talking to a lot of different people about their click experiences, if you will, and they really clicked with someone. When they had that oxytocin boost. And one of the people that I met in a speaking engagement, this was in Augusta, Georgia. They stopped me and they said, you know, I really have to tell you the story. And the guy's name was Paul. Paul as a retired military lieutenant colonel was a special ops guy. So very, very tough guy runs Mayerthans for fun. And his, an Ironman. Paul tells me about the story about he was in charge of a cleanup project years and years ago. And he's in charge of this cleanup project and there's all these people who he's managing in order to write a big proposal. And one of the people that he flies in is a nuclear physicist that he flies in from Paris. And her name is Nadia. And the moment that Paul lays eyes in Nadia, he automatically falls in love with her. Unfortunately, he doesn't make the same kind of impression on her. She can't stand him in the beginning because he tells her something about human relations never changing from the time of Aristotle and Plato. And she sends him a note. I just speak and she says in this note and it says, I completely disagree with you. And he gets in and it's kind of bewildered. And afterwards he says, well, I want to talk to you about it. He says, anytime, anywhere. And that night they get together at the Rich Carlton and Pasadena. It's Pasadena, so I guess they get together at the Rich Carlton. And they're sitting across from each other and they're supposed to talk about work, they're supposed to talk about catching up. And instead they just talk about each other's lives. He talks about being an officer during the Vietnam era. And she talks about being a peace activist. At the end of the night, Paul, who has a lot more guts than I do, says something to Naughty, he says, what if I told you that I was in love with you and I wanted to marry you? And she looks at him and she says, well, let's see what tomorrow will bring. And tomorrow they have the exact same thing sitting across from each other. And at the end of the night says, well, did you think about it? And she says, I thought about it. And she says, what did you decide? She says, I decided I love you too. And a month later they were married. So two really beautiful stories, right? Romney and Juliet, we know that didn't end well, Paul and I idea. What about these relationships? And we had a very, our base question was what is the long term effect of these relationships? It was a very interesting study from Holland. For researchers found a thousand names from the fun book. And they reached out to these couples and there were really three types of couples. The first couple were a Romney and Juliet couple. Sorry, the first couple were friends. They were friends first. So these are people who are now married, who originally were friends first. Second were dateers. And the third type were Romney and Juliet, right? Instant clickers, instant relationships. And what they asked is 25 years later. Let's look at these people's lives. And let's ask some specific questions. And the surprising part of the research was that almost by every factor the couples were the same. They had the same level of education. They had the same level of household income. They had an average 2.1 kids. Here's a difference. And raise your hand for a second. How many people are in relationships? Wow, this is a good one. How many people? One of being relationships or have been in relationships. Imagine being in a relationship. They asked the people this question, three different questions. And as I read these questions, ask yourself whether you would agree or disagree with these. I cannot imagine another person making me as happy as my spouse does. There is something almost magical about my relationship with my spouse. And what happened was that the people who were the clickers, the instant connection folks, tended to agree with the statements much more. The tended to be the ones who felt the most passion in the relationship, who felt the most intimacy in the relationship. Even 25 years later. That was the only difference amongst all the couples. That initial sense stays with us. This is what my brother, this is my brother, this is a psychologist. This is what has been studying for more than 10 years. What he did is he asked a whole host of very, very different people, a very similar question. He asked, when was the time when you felt a really magical connection in your life? And I'm going to draw on you guys for a second. Is there anybody who's had this kind of magical instant connection? You were right there in glasses. Did you see the hand? I did a just call call you. You did? Okay. I never called call. I hate called call. It's fake, let's say. Yes. So what was the experience like? It was cool. Tell me a little bit less. Who was it with? What was it like? Oh, I was in a bar. Oh, first. Well, they were down saying on stuff. Nice. Anybody else has had this experience? Anybody else had the experience? It was a little more brave. Yes, sir. So I met my wife when I'm in Hatton Street and I chased her four blocks. It's like quarter on the street and we got married. Hi, I'm Hatton. Hi. We're living only a couple of watching campus and still married. Congratulations. Oh, nice. Anybody else had that experience? You want to share? Yes. My husband, it'll be 34 years of modest. So I met him and we had the instant connection. And what I have to say is to reflect upon both listening to these stories. Also think about an experience that you've had yourself and you don't want to share. And what Ron found, my brother, was that when people recall an instant connection, when they recall that magical experience, those same emotions, tend to come up with them again, even when it was 30-some odd years later, even when it's remembering chasing your wife down the street, even when you're talking about dancing in a bar with someone. And that those emotions actually really stay with us. And not only define the nature of the relationship, they have a certain level of, again, we're feeling that oxytocin again, even when we think about it years later. And when you think about these kind of stories, oftentimes it's exactly this, right? It's people meeting each other in a bar or down the street. They often have a romantic take to them. And they ask the question, well, what about it work? Right? This is after all we're trying to talk about careers here. Media are actually working together. They're married. They've been married for 20 years. They started a company. And they're really successful. And I'm talking about how their initial-clicking relationship really affected the tenor of their relationship. There's a study that looked at a bunch of MBA students. And they categorized the MBA students into two sectors. One were people who naturally clicked, and the other were just people who knew each other who were just classmates. And they separated them out and then put them in small groups. And they got them to do a couple of tests. The first was to do a bunch of blocks. They had to arrange them in different ways. Very mean-y on purpose. Very boring. And the second one was they had to evaluate application essays. And what they did is they then compared the application essays to how the admissions committees scored them, how the quote-unquote professionals did. And what they found was a time and again, the people who clicked had a very different tenor in terms of their interactions. They were actually much more effective. They build more blocks, they build them better, they were more accurate, and they were much better at the admissions application essay. And the researchers found out that there were two elements of difference. The first element was that the clickers would more naturally chill out each other. The more supportive. It was just kind of a more positive environment that they were in. And the second element was that there was actually more conflict with the people who clicked. And this part is completely counter-intuitive, right? You think that if someone's clicking, if they're so in love, everything's going to be rosy for the rest of their lives. And this is where the studies really shed a light onto an element of these relationships. A group of researchers from England looked at string quartets. And what they did is they asked the string quartets whether the people naturally clicked with each other. And then what they did is they measured how many recording contracts the quartets had, how much they charged for their concerts, right? Two huge elements. Because at the time you were a professional string quartet player, you were on the top of your game. And what they found was that again, that clicking string quartets had more conflict. Now, the conflict actually directly resulted in the string quartets having higher paying gigs, being more successful, getting more recording contracts. And here's why. Let's say you're in a string quartet where you're basically not natural clickers, but you're just, you know, you get along decently. And first violinist decides to play Beethoven piece in one way, second violinist wants to play in a different way. So they're professional to talk about. And it says, you know, John, I want to play this way. Well, Eric, I want to play it a different way. That's nice. At the end of the day, what they oftentimes do is they brush the conflict under the rug. And when it's actually performance time, the first and second violinists aren't agreeing on an interpretation. With the clicking quartets, what you had is that they actually took conflict head on. They actually went there. And by going there, by having those honest conversations, mixed with that intimacy that they had because they liked each other already, you had a better performing crowd. So that initial connection, that initial oxytocin, makes a difference. But we've all seen situations where you don't have that initial connection, right? Where you kind of hate someone from the get-go, or you're the best neutral about them. What do you do then? Is there anything we can do to actually foster that intimacy? The first time we met, we figured we'd check. Now you didn't hate me, Abby. The second time we met, you didn't even remember me. I did too. How do we remember you? The third time we met, we became friends. We were friends for a long time. And then we weren't. And then we fell in love. Three months later, we got married. Yeah, it only took three months. Twelve years and three months. Hi, I'm Ed Salie. Anybody didn't see the movie? A few people didn't see the movie. Okay, so Harry, Salie. They meet the first time. He's a total jerk to her. They're driving across the country. He's awful to her. Second time they meet, they barely remember her. But the third time they met, something happened. And I'm going to show you the clip where it was the third time that they met. It's at a bookstore. And what I like you to do is pay attention to two things. First thing is how open you think he is and how he opens up throughout the clip. And the second thing is watch her body language. Watch Salie's body language and see how she walks towards or away from him during the conversation. Who are you? Bunkie. How's Joe? Fine. I hear he's fine. You know what we're joining in? We just broke up. Oh, I'm sorry, it's too bad. Yeah, well, you know. Yeah. So, what about you? I'm fine. How's married life? Not so good at getting into worse. Oh, sorry. I'm really sorry. Yeah, well, what are you going to do? What happened, you got? So, we're going to look at three elements in which you can, if you will, accelerate these clip connections. And the first one is what we just saw Harry do, right? It was vulnerable. It's not easy. It was open with his feelings. And you think about vulnerability. We oftentimes think about it as a weakness, as being too soft, especially in business. And the data suggests is that leaders who are vulnerable are far more trusted by their employees. People who are vulnerable tend to start more intimate relationships. We talk to a police officer from San Jose down the street who is a hostage negotiator. And we think of hostage negotiators. We oftentimes think of guys who are very gruff, who think of Bruce Willis types. And this guy's job is imagine this, right? Someone took a hostage and you have to basically talk them down. And you can't shoot them or anything like that because the hostages will obviously be killed. So, this guy takes the hostages and he is a two-time offender already, which means that by getting caught now with the hostages, he is going to automatically go to prison for the rest of his life under three strikes. And the cops have a name for this type of scenario. And it's called suicide by cop. The guy is so afraid of going to jail for the rest of his life that he's going to take himself out in a blaze of glory. And since he only talks to this hostage, take her. And he talks to him, imagine this, for 15 hours. It doesn't try to intimidate him. It doesn't try to play mind tricks on him. They just have a conversation. And at the end of the conversation, the hostage takeer says something about his mother. He says, yeah, my mother died a while ago. And then Greg, our hostage negotiator, sees an opening. And authentically says, yeah, I've had my mom. I had my mom died me too, this last year. It was this really terrible, painful experience. And all of a sudden, they bond, right? The most unlikely two people in the world, all of a sudden click. The police officer and the hostage takeer. And they bond so intensely that at the end of the scenario, the guy finally gives himself up. And when he goes out, the SWAT team is ready to pounce on him. And this is wait. I want to give Greg a hug. And the SWAT team is still angry at Greg to this day. The fact that he actually gave the hostage takeer a hug. And you're saying, okay, so what's the big deal about two people giving each other a hug? I would say the big deal is that when people are, even artificially, told to express a level of vulnerability, they automatically form a connection. And that connection, again, obviously changes the tenor of the relationship. It brings in the soft power element. So you have a vulnerability. The second one we're going to look at is proximity. And this one, on first take, looks very obvious, right? You're going to be more likely to connect and form a relationship with someone who goes to stand for it than someone who goes to Berkeley. Or someone who lives in Moscow or someone who lives in North Pole. But what's really interesting about this is how those last few feet really make a difference. Excuse me. Do you mind, dear? Ever around to spell? Not at all. I'm run by the way. Run easily. I'm Harry Potter. So, so it's true. I mean, do you really have the... Third, the what? Let's go. Break it. Anything of the trolly, dear? No thanks. I'm upset. We'll take the lot. Whoa! It's sun. Has anyone seen a tone? A boy named Neville, Snowst one. Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then. So there's a little bit of vulnerability there, right? Where Harry shows his scar, Ron admits not having any money. But think of the simple fact that these three characters, it's for archetypal, spend the rest of their lives together in the same school, right? They dine together, they get in trouble together, they go up together. And that sense of connection for them started right there in that train, in that little train booth. And Harry Potter, in a way, explains a mystery that was faced by Stanford researchers, setting an MIT dorm. And there was a weird thing going on in the MIT dorm. This isn't the actual dorm, but it was shaped like this. They tore it down. It was a U-shaped dorm. And here's the mystery. There were residents throughout the dorm, they asked them, how many people are you really friendly with? And the residents in the middle had a ton of friends. And the residents living in the edge of the dorm had no friends whatsoever. So the first guess, you'd say, well, why is that? It might be pretty simple, right? If you're kind of a loner, you live at the edge of the dorm. Well, the housing assignments were actually random. So they really sat down and said, well, what could it actually be? And what it came down to was how physically close you live to people. And specifically, when they ask people, who is your best friend in the school at MIT? 40% of the people said that it was their next door neighbor. And their next door neighbor, the place between two doors, was a distance of 19 feet. And something really weird happens when you go to the person who lives the next door down. 38 feet. All of a sudden, the chances of people hitting it off, of making a connection, goes down by half. You go down another 19 feet. It goes down by half again. It's exponential. It's not linear. Researchers at Bell Lab asked a company, it was a research company, about who you're most likely to collaborate with. Regardless of interest in the field or anything like that or education. And in scientific environments, people were much more likely to collaborate with people who weren't exactly right next to them. 10.3%. When you went down to the other side of the hallway, it could be the same department, it could be people working on the exact same project. The likelihood of them collaborating is 1.9%. You go down to another floor, and it's fraction of a percent. You go to a different building, and there's almost no chance of people collaborating. The thing of the implications of that, of when you're having a meeting, do you show up? When you're having a conversation, do you have a virtual conversation, or do you do something in person? A study about work meetings found that the vast majority of the meeting, of what was useful about the meeting, actually happened before and after. Not doing, because that's when people were able to develop a little bit of trust with each other. So this is a really interesting crowd. Why don't we have a very brief meeting right here? I need just six volunteers, this is going to be fun, and exciting, I promise. So just either stand up or come on down, and I need six people. One, yay, two, three, four, five, and I think we have six. I want you guys each to grab one of these chairs, what they're called, and I just want to sit in a circle. Oh, actually, no, sit right here, if you don't mind. Sorry, there's more space. Just say, this is actually a former circle. Great, great, great. Perfect. Let's give him a round of applause. That was a fantastic circle, fantastic circle. I'm not going to make you guys actually have a boring meeting, because we've been in enough of those. But I want you to do something. I want you to lift your arms and about, try to touch other person's shoulders. And see, you had to adjust a little bit, but most of you literally sat about arms length apart. And that's how we sit, this is a very cultural thing, you can let your arms down. It's about how we sit in the United States. Now, I want you to do another thing, and this is going to feel weird, but it's going to be good. I promise you. Are you up for it? Yep. So maybe just say, just go around right now and just say your name, just hi, my name is... Hi, my name is Lauren. Hi, my name is Jonathan. My name is Alex. My name is Jay. I'm Hendrick. My name is Gabriel. And one thing I get you guys to literally sit knee to knee. Like touching knees. And what I want you to do now, again, very simple, just tell me what you ate for breakfast today, if you had breakfast at all. I have banana. Eggs. I don't have breakfast. Apple. Eggs. I had cocoa puffs. A question for you guys. How does it feel sitting knee to knee? It's been weird, and everyone's breath smells great. It's fun. I'm so connected to everyone. Really? Yeah. We're friends already. I don't know if you can see them from here. I don't know if you can see their faces. There is a little bit of... They're smiling more. And notice, and I'm going to pick on you. Notice whose body language now, as it was before. You're kind of leaning into each other. And thank you. This was the... This was the meeting. You did a fantastic job. Thank you. Thank you. Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Yeah? Nice to meet you. Those last few feet really make a difference. But those last few inches make a whole lot of difference. And try this out. And I've seen this happen in the army. I've seen this happen in hospitals. I've seen this happen in corporations. When there's a conflict in an organization, they get people to literally set knee to knee. And I'm not trying to make any converts here or something like that. But I would talk to them afterwards and see whether it actually felt different. I mean, you felt connected just by talking about breakfast foods and by your names. And yet, there's that rush of oxytocin that we talked about. And we talked about that... There's a research from Berkeley about the NBA. About the power of touch. And what they did is they looked at all 30 NBA teams in the 2008-2009 season. And then counted the number of times the players touched. When they were celebrating. When they were hugging each other. When they gave high fives. When they gave fist bumps. And what they found out was that the teams where there was more touch were actually much more successful by the end of the season. And the theory is that touch translated into greater trust. And the people kind of felt a little bit closer to each other. And that collaboration is actually really good in the court. So we can be vulnerable. We can try to literally stick ourselves next to each other. The last thing we're going to look at is people who have this as a natural trait. They're called high self monitors. I went to meet Dina Kaplan. Dina has a problem in her life. The biggest problem that Dina has in her life is that she gets invited to too many waiting imitations every year. And she gets invited to these imitations where people invite her that she's barely met. And she's natural when she goes into, if she was in this room, if only Dina was in this room. People just naturally like her. She's not just likable by being very beautiful. But she just has that natural kind of personality. And probably a lot of us have met someone like that. Some people probably in here are like that. People who can form these natural instant connections. A Stanford researcher try to figure out what is it about people like that? How is it that they're able to form these connections? And what he did is he got a bunch of people to answer questions. And whether they agree to disagree with these questions and see whether you agree with this. I find it hard to initiate the behavior of other people. I have trouble changing my behavior to suit different people in different situations. And lastly, I can make him practice speeches even on topics about which I have almost no information. Dina would have answered no to the first two questions and yes is the last question. And it's not that Dina is fake. It's not that Dina is disingenuous in any way. The thing about people like Dina is that they naturally meet us where we are as opposed to trying to for us to meet her where she is. She naturally mirrors us. And when people naturally mirror us, we naturally tend to like them. So you're saying well it's great for Dina, you know, it's fantastic for a cocktail party. And maybe it's even fantastic if you want to get a lot of wedding imitations. What about when you guys graduate? A team looked at high self monitors and low self monitors and normal people actually graduated and they looked at their career fields. And what they noticed was that high self monitors tend to change jobs much more frequently. But there's a difference. The high self monitors were much more likely to be in the center of networks. And the reason that they changed jobs so frequently was because they were getting promoted so rapidly that they got different job offers. They were much more successful. They were making more money. They were able to have higher positions in less time. And when you look at their position within the company, right, by any social theorist would say who is the person you want to be in this equation, right? We're going to be the guy in the center. So for an average person, it takes 18 years to get into the center of the network. I guess how long it takes a high self monitor. 13 months. A high self monitor can achieve within 13 months what it takes a normal person, someone like us, 18 years. And it's not that they're natural schmusers. It's not that they have the ability to pass it more business cards. It's just that they mirror themselves into the situation. They're able to be more fluid. And that brings us back to the army. It brings us back to forms of leadership. When we think of leadership and when we think of the corporation, it was actually created by generals, the modern corporation, the hierarchy. And you think about tones in corporation for a minute and think about how you can change that tone. I'm going to show you two videos. They're going to be very similar. The first video I'm going to show you is this is something really, really, pretty amazing. It's people who strap parachutes to their skis and then go down a mountain. So I'm just going to show you a little bit of this clip. I'm going to show you a little bit of this clip. I'm going to show you a little bit of this clip. I'm going to show you a little bit of this clip. I'm going to show you a little bit of this clip. I'm going to show you a little bit of this clip. I'm going to show you a little bit of this clip. I'm going to show you a little bit of this clip. I'm going to show you a little bit of this clip. I'm going to show you a little bit of this clip. I'm going to show you a little bit of this clip. We'll think pretty intense. Crazy. Anybody want to do it? Couple people. How's the room feel? How do you feel when you watch it? I'm excited. I'm kind of in awe of these guys. What I did is we're going to see the exact same movie. And we're just going to change the music. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. How's it feel? And when you think about this video, it's exact same message, right? It's exact same content. And yet, you can change the tone. And whether it's the army or a business or a classroom, it's like being a little softer. All of a sudden you can see the beauty of this thing. You can understand why someone would do something crazy like that. The elegance in it. And if you want to, whether it's by how we interact with each other, how close we sit with each other, how open, personal we are, how much we meet people where they are, we can change that tone as well. It's a lot easier to send than done. But I think that from a generational perspective, from a chemical perspective, there's a lot to be said for oxytocin. I'd argue that in our beginning, that oxytocin is maybe the more important of the two chemicals. We know how to deal with fight or flight. The question is how can we really leverage oxytocin? How can we leverage that South power? How can we leverage intimacy towards the exact same goal? So I really, really appreciate being here and it's fantastic being here again and Stanford. And I think we have a few minutes for Q&A. So thank you. Mr. I have a question on these things and connections. We're here talking to media about how people meet quickly. They click on them, they get married in Vegas. And obviously it doesn't work out. Is that the perception bias? What happens there? It happens a lot. It is the perception bias. So the longitudinal study, the study that we talked about, that looked at people 25 years afterwards. I find that the people were actually pretty similar afterwards in terms of the instant connections versus the people who were more kind of new to it for a longer time. So can you get infatuated? Yes. Can you make really dumb mistakes in Vegas? Yes. The thing though is that we actually go in the exact opposite way. We try to think about, especially in business. We try to think, we try to have kind of like first-grader mentality. If someone really liked each other, let's separate them so they're not in the same team. Let's discourage people from dating in the office. Let's discourage people from being friends. While all the data suggests that the office said it might actually be much more effective. So yes, you can be infatuated. And yes, just because you meet someone who you think is really pretty down the street doesn't mean you should marry her. But the converse of that is that you shouldn't discount something just because you had those first initial strong feelings. Yes, sir? I think Oxford also has a dark side to it. It also promotes ethnocentrism, tribalism. And it's also being shown study that increased the amount of MD someone feels, an anger they feel when they're betrayed. So how do you balance between the light side which is, you know, you feel in a group. And at dark side when people outside of the group are trying to enter, you feel you want to protect yourself and attack other people. And on the flip side, you say that, you know, people when they're closer, they work together better. So does that mean if you promote an oxytocent-based environment, you're going to make silos more easily, you know, curve. And people basically base their relationship on closely rather than this collaborative meme that goes beyond just your emotions and beyond how we feel at first sight. That's a good question. When you want to create collaboration in a large institution or an environment, theoretically you just put a bunch of people on Facebook and they'll collaborate together. The problem is that people don't actually do that. The problem is that in order to build a real trust-based environment, you need to have some level of emotional connection. So you're right, if I'm outside of the circle, if I was outside, if these six people who sat here were having lunch together, would any of you walk up to them and say, hi, my name is Ori, I'd like to join you for lunch. No way, right? There were obviously a closed-off system, which can be problematic. And at the same time, what if you're trying to get that specific circle to be more intimate with each other? What if you're trying to get them into a circle to be more trusting? From a societal perspective, the government asks everyone, sorry, the government has a huge database that they collect that basically asks a zillion questions about people's relationships or friendships, things like that. And one of the questions that they ask is how many confidants, very, very close friends people have. The numbers over the years have been basically pretty much steady. And on average, the most frequent answer given is three. People have about three confidants. Something very interesting happened in 2002, 2003, right when people started doing a lot more social networking. So that's what is the modal or the most frequent answer that is given right now in terms of how many confidence people have. One, guess? Ten. Seven. Zero. The mode is zero. That we've given up in the idea of building cross-ciles and building a ton of connections. We've, I think, to a degree lost out on the intensity of the connections, the intimacy of the connections. But I would agree with you that you need both. The last thing you need is a complete solid remediation where it's asked versus them. However, when you're in asked versus them situations, it also builds intimacy. Yes, in the middle. Yes. Do you research your findings, either consciously or consciously, change how to live your life or are anything you try to do or live your more conversation about since you've started getting this kind of research? If only it was a better person. I guess a couple of, honestly, the best biggest two differences are one is the guy who I'm writing my current book with, this guy named Judah. I met him at this party and we just had a really great conversation. I was like, what are you doing? I was like, oh, I'm writing a book about instant connections. And also, we had that, you know, we had that click. And a little bit, we were just walking away and I was like, wait a second, my research says, you know, you actually follow those kind of relationships. And I went to him and I did something, I've never done this to anyone else. And I went to my back and said, you know what? You look like someone who I want to be friends with. Can we be friends? And he felt a little for a gradian and he felt a little silly and I was like, yeah, yeah, let's. And we had dinner. And now he's somehow probably work closer with than anybody else. In terms of how I try to behave, the biggest thing I aspire towards, A, show up always, you know, when in general, from the Army calls, even if you don't know exactly what generals do, you show up in the same office. And B is this idea of being high self-monitoring in terms of really meeting people where they are. And I think there's obviously a philosophy around that. But there's so much to think to be said about, how can I actually present myself in a softer way? And I know I'm a guy living in San Francisco. I don't that's an exactly huge problem that I have. But I think it's a continual path for me personally. Yes, hi. You're talking about self-control and lack at all. How are the individuals adapted themselves to people that they meet? I was wondering whether if this kind of a mentality gets embedded into you over time, whereas you keep on putting them in your circumstances, they do not become overly dependent on how it's at forces and you do not have one identity of yourself that cannot do tough times in just death. You just put death and you just put it on a knife. Yeah, the research suggests that it really is them. So people who are, research just a couple things. One is that it's an innate thing. And two, so people are born with it. And two is that it's not that they don't have a personality. It's not that they're going to, Dean is going to be a very different person if she's here than if she's at a big party or if she's at an investor meeting. It's just that she's going to be able to modulate her. There's a slide that I skipped through the restaurant test. And think about sitting in a restaurant. It's very quiet. This candles. A high self-monitor is going to be able to match that environment. A low self-monitor is going to talk a little bit like this. They're going to not know how to modulate themselves to the environment. Interestingly, you sometimes want low self-monitors in your work because other than when they're going to give you more honest feedback about something. So you want a combination. But it's the high self-monitors who are going to modulate themselves more, who are going to end up being more successful. So it depends on which side of the equation you want to be on. I think we have time for one more. So what happens after those things is created that perform these instant connections? So what the research shows about when this happens? What makes two people click? It's so big mystery. We looked at specific psychological factors, like the vulnerability, the touching, things like that. Well, actually plays a really big role. So that in one set, they put people, women in a room, and they had them look at pictures of guys. And they found the guys much more attractive if there was a hidden swab, like in the corner, taken from this guy's sweat. Yeah, sweat a lot. That's a ticket. We're also much more attractive people who are similar to us. So that if someone has the same name, you're likely to give them more money. And even if anything name is Steve, just by being asked, if you think that someone has the same birthday, the same horoscope, even the same fingerprint pattern. And we really only started to understand the neurology of it. There was a recent study that found out that when people have emotional pain, we feel it the exact same way as physical pain in our brain so that we are naturally kind of built in order to build those connections and we're finding out. But let me know what you find out in terms of your personal research. And perfect. Thank you so much.
