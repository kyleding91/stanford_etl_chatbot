 This is the OddPatterer Thought Layer series brought to you by Stanford Equator. Today, I am delighted to welcome Sophia Edelstein and Nathan Condomer to ETL. Sophia is the co-founder and co-CEO of Pair Eyewear. Since its inception, Pair Eyewear has put consumers at the center of the innovation process, ensuring that the brand is at the front of redefining the eyewear experience by offering continual, customizability, freedom of choice, and affordability for glasses. Her role, Sophia leads brand marketing and creative and development initiatives in addition to overseeing web and product design. She was named and honoree for Forbes under 30 in 2020. Prior to co-founding Pair Eyewear, Edelstein earned her undergraduate degree at Stanford University, which was where she and her co-founder, Nathan, discovered that current eye glass options were limited, expensive, and not at all that fun. From there, the duo made it their mission to respond to a long overdue marketplace need to bring countless affordable stylish eye glass options to make eye glass experiences more enjoyable. Nathan Condomer is the co-founder and co-CEO of Pair Eyewear, motivated by his own negative experience of wearing glasses as a child, led me to. Pair is reinventing the entire glasses experiences to be more empowering and fashionable for kids while affordable and stress-free for parents. When Nathan got his glasses at eight years old, they was daunting. Like most kids, he was self-conscious and embarrassed to wear them to school because of the stigma existing around glasses. After sharing his story with his co-founder, Sophia, the two wondered why nobody had redesigned glasses to be more fun and dynamic. Talking to 400 families, they discovered that kids don't enjoy wearing glasses and parents dreaded the expensive and stressful process. Today, one in four children wears glasses and experts estimate that by 2050, it will be one in every two. Compiled by the stories they heard, Nathan, Sophia devoted the rest of their senior year at Stanford to reinventing the experience of wearing and buying glasses. Everyone, please join me in welcoming Nathan and Sophia. So we're going to kick the solve. Maybe Nathan and Sophia, you could introduce a little bit of what Pair Eyewear does. Maybe a little bit more about the company. And then we're going to dive into a set of questions. Fantastic, Emily. Thank you for having us. Excited to chat with you all. We both sat in those seats before as undergrad is not too long ago. I'm excited to and just be honored to be here to talk to you all. So just some quick intro is on Nathan. This is Sophia. We are the two co-founders and co-CEOs of Pair. We were Stanford undergrads at the 2017 and Met. Early on, our second week of undergrad because we were both in rival freshman dorms, Twain and Mark and had become best friends at that second week of school. And as Emily mentioned, came up with the idea for Pair when I was just telling Sophia all about my experience of wearing glasses as a kid and how it was daunting then and then as an adult, you know, really just an unexciting experience that we wanted to really revolutionize. And the company has changed and evolved a lot since that senior year at Stanford when we first came up with the concept, but the concept is stage rule, which while we were seeing you as a Stanford, we came up with this idea to revolutionize the product of iWare to make it something more personalized and self-expressive. We realized that you wake up every morning, you choose your outfits, your clothes, your accessories, they're all a form of self-expression. However, your glasses say the same day in and day out because they're notably expensive. So with Pair, we wanted to create a product that could actually be self-expressive that you were able to affordably change on a daily basis. So with Pair, you can change the color and design of your glasses by attaching what we call a top frame onto your base frame. So, since you need the ears rocking, a green pair right now, you can even change your glasses into sunglasses. We have thousands of designs available. We launched new collections in addition basis every Wednesday at noon, almost like the sneaker head mentality, and our customers come back to collect them all. So our average customer owns over eight top frames in their collection, but we have these whale customers that have over 800. The most rapidly growing iWare company today, we're mostly focused on adults being over 90% of our customers, but as Emily mentioned, we originally started in kids, and we still have that line. So our vision is to build one of the largest global iCare companies focused on personalization, self-expression, and joy. We really focused on disruptive product innovation and product design, which is really what's unique around the value prop and what creates our retention focus business model. So unlike other iWare business models, where a customer will maybe purchase a pair of glasses, acts every two to three years, hair customers are coming back every week and every month to add to their collection. When you look at our customers, it almost looks like a subscription business model, actually being one. We also created another mode around the business by becoming one of the first iWare companies to really focus on licensing. So we saw massive opportunity to bring your favorite brands and artists and characters to iWare for the first time ever. So we've created one of the largest licensing iWare companies in the world with partnerships with the likes of Marvel and the NBA, and every major US Sports League and artists like Van Gogh and Frida Kahlo and even nonprofit partners. Today our team is 175 people strong and we're also fully vertically integrated. So we do all of our own manufacturing in-house, actually in California or Irvine, where we produce all of our top frames completely on demand in addition to all of our lenses. We've been able to figure out how to make a US manufacturing actually more affordable from a product, called perspective, than when you were outsourcing it. In addition to that, we've raised over 140 million dollars in venture capital across a series of rounds and we're happy to chat about the whole fundraising process more today and our most recent round was a $75 million dollar theory scene which happened. I want to say it was like five, six months ago but it feels like it was yesterday. Thanks for putting speed so quickly. Yeah and you know it's been an incredible journey that we've been on. I feel so grateful to be on that journey but we certainly could not have imagined in our wildest dreams sitting where you all are that this would have been our experience and seven years later we'd be at this 175-person team. So we wanted to share a little bit about very quickly what that journey looked like from being seniors at Stanford to where we are today and then can go much deeper in-depth at some questions but really all began our senior year. I was studying mechanical engineering so fear was studying human biology with the focus in healthcare economics and design and you know we met as a part of a club called Design for America where we really originally just started to explore the eyewear space and the eye care industry broadly and understand the challenges in the industry and the challenges from the customer experience standpoint. As Emily mentioned you know I had that experience very first hand. I don't know of short hands if how many people wear glasses. I imagine it's a big crew there but you know I had that experience intimately of how daunting glasses was as a child, how unexciting it was as an adult where you know every other consumer has a real excitement among the other products in their life like shoes, clothes, jewelry, accessories those are all an extension of ourselves in our personality but glasses had just always felt like the static medical device and one of the aha moments was that my senior year my little brother Nikki was getting glasses for the first time. He was really upset about it though he loved his sneakers he had a bunch of pair of you know like night-tees shoes and just really didn't want glasses and went out and really embraced you know the D-school and design thinking to understand what were the challenges for families, talked to hundreds of families and found that the iWare business model was really broken you know glasses were extremely expensive upwards of 300 plus dollars for a pair of glasses the experience of going to a store waiting for glasses for weeks was a really antiquated model and you know people were unhappy the the glasses were inaccessible and not affordable and just lacked personalization we found that kids and adults really wanted to be able to express themselves to their iWare fine joy in iWare and that was really the aha moment where we realized that hearing from people they wanted to be able to match their favorite clothes or match their favorite sports in their iWare their favorite characters and we essentially started prototyping this concept of how could we bring customization and personalization to iWare we actually did you know some really early prototyping at the PRL at Stanford the product realization lab 3D printed you know laser cut prototypes and found consumer asking us when they could purchase the glasses when they were absolutely not real glasses and that's when we knew we were really onto something and you know after 2017 we graduated we both deferred the jobs we had lined up to start pair and eventually officially launched a market at the end of 2019 and had some really exciting moments along the way we actually aired on shark tank four years from today actually today's a four-year anniversary of our shark tank airing March 6 2020 and you know it's been an incredible growth trajectory since when we when we aired then we were four full time employees and now we're 175 so we scaled a bunch to the pandemic so a lot of really unique times doing that growth you know as Sophia mentioned we started in kids but today we're and i work company for all individuals with you know over 90% being adults we started with 10 top-frame designs available in our collection but now we have over thousands of designs one of the largest licensing player in the space and while we started in online we're now creating really disruptive omnichannel partnerships with existing optical pillars so you know the evolution of the business model has been mighty and we're we're like excited to chat with you all about our journey i have so many questions but i have to ask the first one that really peaked my interest for your whales 800 800 in their collection like how does one even organize one's collection collectibles like who are these people it's incredible um this i i like wake up in the morning sometimes and read we had this group called the pair family group which is an invite only facebook community for our customers where they're constantly posting uh and bragging about how many top frames they have the limited edition trials they have in posting pictures of like how they store and organize these top frame it's impressive um this morning i woke up when customer Dustin who now actually he was one of the customers who who hit over 800 and now he's at like nine sixty and he's trying to go to a thousand um and he has an entire closet organized um each top frame has like an individual number he has a whole like system he's like become a pair i were celebrity in the group um that's like it's truly incredible like the customers are so incredibly creative and enthusiastic um and kind of going back to what Nathan mentioned around you know the whole idea for the company started by interviewing uh individuals and people and and finding real problems and trying to solve them that's very true to our philosophy that i so you know even myself like i'm constantly reading through a customer feedback and post because i really want to understand how people are interacting with the product now they love it and and and what they don't so we can continually oh gosh uh you know i i wonder what tipped it for your is Dustin you mentioned right like it was it at a hundred he's like i i should get to a thousand now because i'm at a hundred and you know or was it was it a certain collection like was it he he had the whole entire Marvel collection he's like i better move on to like the whole entire you know Disney collection like what like what are some patterns with these like extreme users they just they one i think the limited edition nature of it really helps is our customers know if they don't grab the designs during these weekly launches on one day they might never read back um and then we release it in the form as well that gets that vi-rality so every sunday before a collection launch on one's day we email a teaser email out to only our VIP customers that teaser email shows that the designs that are going to launch on one's day of course those VIP customers then screenshot it and share it with the entire community and then everyone talking about like uh like we have there's like words even in the community like customers say i'm safe when like they're they're okay and they're not gonna get any and then they'll also report the community like how many reinforce will be like oh no like this week like i'm in for like and they'll circle the ones that they like and it starts this like vi-rality effect and Dustin of course he leads that we had a collector day and i remember he posted yesterday about how he's like committed already for 50 so good good collection um but it's really amazing to see that behavior and i think it's been part of the reason why we've been so successful because we've really been able to grow uh this new community around uh really this new user behavior of you know every morning i wake up and you're gonna decide we talk for me while and so we hate a change and we encourage change and you can wear that you know really hot landish funky design because it doesn't you know it's not a three hundred dollar commitment you have to wear for the next two to three years god that is so fun that is so fun i can i imagine there's probably secondary markets for some of your limited edition top frames at this point right you know the really hard to get that you've only done it's like baseball i'm talking baseball cards at this point right yeah there are there's a number of bicell trade groups out there where limited edition tops will go for you know more than originally bought for um so it's really been cool oh created by the customers gosh what surface and i want to maybe back up a little bit and go back to you know Nathan you mentioned that you and syphia met very early on at stanford when you were both at what toy on and larkin did i get that right? way in twain and like twain and larkin i was like twain and larkin are very hard like you just um tell me a little bit about what it's been like to work as co-founders and co-CEAs because that's a pretty unique setup right you know oftentimes um you know it's it's it's easier some people believe to have a single ceo a single final decision maker you know the buck stops here right you know and your board of directors is one person to hold accountable versus two so could you talk a little bit about how you know you two one from being friends to co-founders to co-CEAs and what works and you know what else in work how do you work through what doesn't work and and and how do you work through conflict for example? yeah that that's all great questions Emily things we've thought a ton about along the way but you know to back up i think it did really all start from when we had just become amazing friends at stanford that set the foundation to i think have a successful co-CEO and co-founder relationship because it is certainly one of the most you know involved relationships you will have throughout life it's has having a co-founder um it's like a relationship and so i think you know for us we have such a strong foundation of trust in our friendship and that translated extremely well enabling success we are co-CEO and co-founder um set up and you know there's a lot to there's both a ton of benefits from it and then there's also a lot of things to essentially be thoughtful around to ensure success in the relationship because there are you know as many you know investors companies will you know he was like you do maybe want just one person in that CEO but we've actually found it to be really beneficial to have the both of us um so to start I think you know some of the benefits that it's really allowed for us is that it's allowed us to go really deep into certain areas and the two of us it's allowed us to become experts and really lead the strategy and some core functionalities of the business and that's really how we set up and divide our responsibilities is through functional areas of the business so you know probably year or two into starting the company is when we started to split up core responsibilities that we knew would be extremely important to the success of the business and so I oversee more of the operational physical products side of the business of supply chain manufacturing R&D you know customer experience where so fee overseas a lot more of the outward consumer facing sides of the business so all of the marketing tech you know website product all those you know areas you mentioned earlier brand design and then we actually share people and finance you know core elements of the business the drive you know business success and business culture and you know being able to split those areas but then also come back to talk about them and wouldn't really beneficial for us because it allows us to essentially pressure check our thinking right I'll come to Sophia about you know here's what I'm imagining our product innovation and product roadmap strategy looking like over the next three years and so to hear here with some of the what those thinking about and developing this what are your thoughts right you have both you know a deep thinking view where I've been spending all my time thinking about it and then Sophia can come and be like oh but what about this and what about that and we can really debate and discuss strategy together in each other's areas of the business and so that's been extremely helpful to really always drive to the best answer and best solution for the business because that's ultimately as a team what you're trying to do is find the best solution for the business find the best solution for your consumers and your customers but there is definitely a lot that we had to learn along the way in place to really ensure success in the co-CEO setup so that first was just high level of trust I think that is core really tiny co-founder relationship putting sort of the co-CEO part of side just any co-founder setup you need to have an extremely high level of trust because you're going to be in the weeds in the thick event for many years so you better like that person and I think thankfully we were best friends at our college and so we had a lot of foundation of you know really liking each other and being friends that translated really well to to success of pair and part of what comes with that trust and it needs to happen in a co-CEO co-founder setup is constant communication you know you mentioned how do you handle conflict there needs to be that level of trust to communicate when there's conflict to have a culture of feedback where you know Sophia can tell me something about hey you know you probably could have done that better or I can say something like that to Sophia and like we have a high level of trust where you know we're not taking that personally but we know that we're all just trying to make each other better and where we've you know really made a culture of open and honest feedback and collaboration a core tenant of a pair's culture and that needs to be strongest within the co-founders and then really waterfall down another few areas it's been really impactful is having clear decision making frameworks so the two of us both really trust the way in which we make decisions in our core areas but we'll come to each other with hey here's a big decision we should probably both discuss together make sure we're aligned and then look back at the data to make sure we're making the most informed decision and then finally I think you know something that's he is to just always be in lockstep in the long term vision of the business and be very crisp and concise and clear with your co-founder on what that vision is and making sure that every decision that making as a business thriving towards building upon the average. It's amazing so Fiat do you have more to add on on from your perspective? I think Nathan covered a lot of it I think you know I think our foundation of friendship was also really helpful at the beginning when things were really tough like the first two years Nathan mentioned we were just working on product development we had both deferred what would have been considered up to your job opportunities I actually said no to the medical school as well we were supporting ourselves by SAT tutoring on the side while we were starting the business so it was also really helpful to just have that friendship at the end of the day because you know when things are tough you have each other to lean on and you're going through it all together so I think you know going through the hard beginnings also made conflict when it comes up in the future a lot easier because you have you know you you went through all of that together so that was also really helpful for us and I think being low ego I think is really important as well I think it's really important for any founder I think you know some certain founders of different philosophies on this but we're both incredibly low ego which is really important because we both went into this you know essentially knowing nothing neither of us had started a business and our philosophy is always you know we're probably we probably don't know the answer from the beginning like how could we any prior experience but our job is to learn faster and smarter than you know everyone else out there in order to succeed and help each other do that so if a speaking opportunity comes up it doesn't matter who takes it you do have the same understanding of the business we're both equals we you know taken that philosophy I think from you know day zero to today you know what I think is incredibly beautiful is that you both agree that you go you have low egos and from a principles perspective really focus on what's good for the business and what's good for your users and if that's the North Star all of your conflict is to solve for those two problems and through those lenses and it's really powerful to have those sort of set aside ahead of time before conflict happens so the trust is actually supported by a set of principles that you are operating by day to day um so let me go back to I again I'm fascinated to learn about your journey so the fact that you were doing SAT tutoring you know the fact that when you first went on Shark Tank it was you and that was four years ago and like to the day um can we talk a little bit about maybe that period of your rapid learning because I know you know you have this culture of how do we learn as quickly as possible from as many people as possible so um not only did you interview 400 people but you managed to talk to people who you know are maybe competitors right like the head of product at Warby Parker how did you manage to find your way to speaking to individuals like that and being able to have open competitions with them and learn quickly even though it might feel competitive or you know in conflict of some way that's a great question and I think this is one as well we're being a Stanford student I think really helps so when we were first starting pairs Nathan mentioned we had created handmade prototypes in the PRL are very difficult to go from handmade prototypes to an actual product you can sell them even though people were asking us to buy them so we knew that if we wanted to accelerate their process and do it just as well as the top I wear brands out there we were going to have to find an I wear expert who believed in mission and could help us you know bring the the product envisioned to reality and help us also protect it through intellectual property and so we um essentially just looked on LinkedIn right we were looking on LinkedIn we called message this man Leezar who's the former head of product at Warby Parker recently coincidentally left he was there for their first five years let all of their product development and I you know the message essentially began is like we're Stanford students we have this crazy idea to change the business model associated with I wear to make it more retention focused and to make it something more self expressive we think we can partner with all of these brands um can we just get on the phone and chat right like I think you know you have a Stanford evil address that's something that's incredibly um powerful and you're really only a few degrees of separation really from anyone in the world um so you have to kind of just shoot your shot and this was one of those examples where we did that and it really paid off so Lee um loves the idea I think you know in I wear the most um innovation that really been had been Warby Parker which was I mean incredible they really led the revolution of e-commerce i wear prior to them people were going I wear in person but the actual physical product didn't change they had made something that was more fashionable and slightly more prep to your door but still the physical product you know was still a one and done product you buy it every two to three years the fundamental business model the fundamental margins weren't very different this really appealed to someone like Lee who had been in the i wear industry for 40 plus year um and wanted to do something different and innovative and exciting so he started working with us to create the initial prototypes and then he became our first hire so we ended up hiring him with her kind of product um and that's really important like we both really fundamentally believe that hiring as a founder like it has to be your superpower like you could be the best coder in the world you'd be the best product lead in the world but of hiring is not your super power like you probably won't succeed in creating a startup because it's all about uh being able to paint your vision to other individuals and convincing them to join something that's incredibly risky i mean at any stage when you're joining a startup and uh invest you know in equity um so we were able to do that with Lee and then from there it was really two plus years to really make sure that we had um the defensibility around the product so we didn't just want to launch a product to market we wanted to make sure we had a family of ip that would protect it in the long term we wanted to make sure the quality was up to par especially because we were originally just launching with children um and that was incredibly important um and then from there i mean there's so many other stories of uh innovation and listening to customers um and i'm happy to get into um but you know even the transition from kids to adults was was one that really just came from listening to stories oh interesting wow okay so many questions still going back to you know you're coming about uh the one of the most critical if not the most critical role of a founder and responsibility of a founder co-founder is to hire can we double click into that a little bit because how does one build that skill set as a Stanford student like what what i mean you talked about being able to communicate the narrative the vision but gosh you being able to hire Lee that's a really big deal and how what would you share with folks in the classroom about how to get to the point where they can hire somebody who is so experienced yeah it's uh i think it really begins with um you have this vision in your head for what you want the company to become and you have to really think through what are the skill sets necessary in order to get there and then you have to be really honest with yourself do i have these skill sets or is this something that we're going to have to go out and and find um and then once you've been able to to recognize that and and realize okay you know at this point you know Nathan out of a catacletan-earing background but was he going to be able to actually manufacture produce file patents well probably not right similarly you know i really interested in marketing but like was i going to be the person uh to figure out from the ground up how to you know run a budget of of 30 million dollars a year you know not necessarily there are people that had done it before and and could start from somewhere that was way ahead we just had to go out there and figure out who the who the person would be and um how they would fit into the culture and the overall uh or structure that so i think that's um a really important skill set and of course we were very hands on with hiring up until probably a year ago um so we would interview almost every single individual to join the company i'd say up until 120 130 people well because we were very very diligent around uh hiring the best talent so we had a very very high bar for who we would hire and we always wanted to make sure that when they joined the company they could hit the ground running so they either had learnings from a previous experience it was so far ahead in their knowledge that they could be uh added up to the company from from date we didn't want to have to train someone for for two years in order to get that value um and then culture is really important um you see as the company grows uh you know you start out being the culture leader and everything kind of comes from you know how you lead and leading by example after your time your managers become the culture leaders and um you know one bad apple completely changed the the culture of your company overnight so uh we we're interviewing everyone because we really wanted to ensure that you know everyone had the same values um such as you know innovation testing and learning uh being data oriented in their decision making ability being very empathetic um and that was really important to us and and something else we thought a lot about and then today uh we we don't interview everyone and even more i kind of wish we did because now you know it feels like people walk into the office and you're like who's this person like um but we interview everyone up until you know probably two degrees of separation from our reporting structure wow wow well maybe i can ask um Nathan a technical question uh coming back to you know coming out as a mechanical engineer i was a mechanical engineer as well and i knew nothing about manufacturing right truly right and you're manufacturing i'm guessing you know in the hundreds of thousands like monthly at this point right in terms of top frames right and so um how did you surround yourself with people who knew how to do that at volume and and um how does one you mentioned best talent right um i said yeah how does how does one evaluate best if one doesn't know the topic themselves they're really good question uh Emily so i i would say there's a few things um it all came comes back to a lot of what Sophia mentioned around identifying the need first right so we identified it certainly wasn't going to be me who knew how to manufacture hundreds and thousands of units at a high quality you know with manufacturers uh and with such precision but we knew that that was a a cute need for the business and so it then comes down to understanding what are the actual core responsibilities of the individual you're looking for and and really thinking about um uh primarily what's the need today maybe into a 12 month horizon maybe maybe 18 month depending on this stage and how fast you're going to business but we we always try to hire not too far ahead of the actual need today what four jobs and roles and responsibilities are we trying to um take action on today and so you know as an example for us Lee was a great example that had a product from Warby who you know our core need at that point was we needed to learn how to just manufacture glasses you know and that's about it right we need to be able to do it for our original collection that need is now very different from today where we're you know selling millions of top frames a year and our manufacturing needs and core roles and responsibilities are actually far different now quality management and quality management systems and processes are more of a need and vendor management and sourcing processes um and procedures that can keep high quality at you know 99.9 percent when you're selling millions of units is a very different skill set almost a very different job uh but then I think in terms of attracting the talent assessing what great talent is there's a few things it's you know certainly asking the right questions to the best of your ability of understanding you know is this person going to be able to do the job that you need them to do so that's sort of the bare minimum but then I think the next level of assessing best is really some of those soft skill elements that Sophia was mentioning is how well are they fitting into the value set that we want to build within pair to to have the culture that we want to pair which is highly innovation focused highly um you know empathetic collaborative focused highly focus on the customer and being adaptable to iterate quickly and pivot if need be and not feeling uncomfortable in you know fast moving environment where we might be asking folks to be pivoting often and moving quickly and iterating so I think that is is the next piece of finding somebody who really meshes with the values that you're trying to build within the company and the culture that you want and then finding somebody that's really um bought into your mission and vision that's one of the things we've really recognized as a core you know force multiplier for the business when we've found folks and you know a lot of the folks that we've brought onto the team the majority really since you know first 14 members of Characan until now have been with the company for years and and very highly retention focused from an employee standpoint too and that's because we've really tried to suss out you know all of these folks really bought into the mission and vision of the company um because that's sort of the last element of the if they are they'll you know really pour their their sort of heart and soul into the business you know we've kind of uh talk a little bit about Characan here and there and bits and pieces and I wanted to take a moment maybe we could um maybe you could share what Characan is uh for those of us in the room that might not know and then also why you chose to take that path that's quite a unique path for entrepreneurs and this four of you was two of you plus leave plus one other and uh this is still I think still when you were doing SAT tutoring right and so these were hard times um what led to that decision and I know it's been kind of a rocket ship after that but like maybe you know where you can like what was that experience like and and why do you think it put you on a rocket ship path after that Characan was an awesome experience for those that don't know Characan's a TV reality show where they pick entrepreneurs who have companies to pitch to a panel of celebrity investors like Mark Cuban and pitch for for funding in your business um it's a really fun show uh we encourage everyone to go watch it if you haven't seen our episode it was really fun um it's back when you know as Emily said we were really focused on kids that was the focus of the pitch back then and we decided to go on Shark Tank because at the time we were family and kid focused and we realized that if you want to grow a company uh a fast-paced startup trajectory and go from zero to a hundred over night you need to do things that are more risky to help accelerate growth uh normal businesses don't grow 160 percent year over year it's just it's not natural so in order to do the unnatural you need to find virality you need to have growth marketing tactics that allow you to grow at an unprecedented rate and you need to do kind of risky things like Shark Tank so for us uh we can realize that Shark Tank was this amazing opportunity where if erred uh we'd be able to you know be on the TV screens of you know families all across America overnight and be able to tell our story kind of directly from ourselves um to to these families and again in front of them um so with Shark Tank we all reach out to actually by a producer i think they must have maybe read about the company in an article um and from there you begin an audition process um there's no guarantee ever that you're actually gonna air even when you film there's no guarantee um which is definitely stressful but you kind of just have to trust and and do your best to create entertaining TV because that's what's likely gonna air um but it's a really fun process um and uh a great experience so we we ended up erring uh we found out we were gonna air only a week before we aired so it was like um you know mad dash to get the website ready make sure you know nothing was gonna crash um we ended up having a walked party which was very uh funny because it was the last weekend you know it was four years from today it was the last weekend before New York City we're based in New York completely shut down because of COVID so at the time i remember we had you know hundred people friends and family early investors in a room together we were handing out pure rel and we thought that was gonna be fine we're all gonna be okay uh luckily no one ends up getting COVID from the viewing party but it's really funny to look back and it really jumpstarted kind of the rapid growth that we then you know continue to see throughout the next four years um and some of the ways that it really helped is we actually um it was really helpful actually in gaining our first licensing partnerships um to a created trust not just with consumers who were seeing the brand but also with licensing partners um and it allowed us partially to sign but became our first licensing deal which was Marvel and then the NBA those were our first two partners and then after that um you know we really created this well-oiled machine of of signing on another licensure is and also um very much a strategy um of you know if you're not on the pair marketplace you're kind of missing out on this revenue opportunity so when we spoke to DC Comics they're only um their only con was you know i can't believe you you talked to Marvel first you know you know that really you all of that really happened because of Shark Tank and then of course sales and um because of Shark Tank we actually started seeing this really interesting behavior where adult customers started purchasing our kids frames um we were perplexed up for us we're like these are for kids or these adults buying it um but we understood after doing interviews that they loved the concept and they wanted it as well and they wanted it so badly they were willing to buy a child's pair of glasses not knowing if it would fit um and at the time our investors they were very focused on us staying within kids but once we saw this behavior at Nathan and I kind of won against their wishes and we were like we have to lean into this right like this is customer demand we're seeing customer need and we're solving a customer problem with adults so we created a landing page on our website um we found models in New York City essentially overnight we brought them into the office we did a photo shoot of them wearing the largest uh children's frames that we had and we started running ads uh for adults and overnight the business exploded of course we we showed these metrics for investors you know two weeks later and they were like oh my god we always knew this would work for adults like this is incredible um but that was kind of just what example of you know as founders you have to take risky bets you have to iterate incredibly fast right like that landing page when we look back like I would laugh at it today like it was horrible the ads were so bad um nothing was high fidelity but it was a proof of concept and one that we could uh do incredibly quickly to get learnings that would then give us enough confidence to invest more money into something um and today you know as Nathan mentioned were 90% adults you know I was gonna ask you about the pivot but you already answered me and I think the headlight the headline for me there was uh you did it even though your investors were like don't do it and you quickly iterated and came back with data and that's really powerful as a signal one can trust that there's something behind that and so that's very cool that's very cool um so maybe if we can take a moment uh to touch upon investors as well so I know you had some early investors in the business uh ones that probably used a lot of corral when they were at your you know your your party uh how how do you choose investors it's a great question Emily and it's actually not you know from a culture standpoint not so dissimilar to how we would choose and hire talent but I think for us you know we really look for you know person-formers folks that align with our values set and believe in our mission and vision company and and believe in you know so be and I as founders to really lead and have trust in us to lead and execute on the vision that we set for the company and I think we've been really fortunate uh to find a handful of investors that have been extremely supportive and in our event and really helpful as well so we think a lot you know how will these investors add value how will they be able to help pair and you know the way in which investors help will be different in each round so when we were looking for earlier stage investors the ways in which we were looking for help are very different the ways in which we're looking for help today but I think for us it all really came down to who are people that can really help pair that believe in pair and believe in us to execute on our vision and coincidentally enough you know some of our main lead investors from our rounds are all Stanford grads. We didn't choose it that way but it it's so indipitously happened our first major institutional investor was a man named Charles Hudson on the Bay Area actually teaches a Stanford class as well and we've had many lessons so it's been it's been a great journey to have you know really supportive investors that can also provide a lot of experience a wealth of knowledge from past experiences and companies to help guide you know us and pair in the right direction. Amazing I realize that you need to let the students actually have a chance to ask questions or I could ask questions on the plot but I I want to have a chance to ask you the most important question which is if I know you can't choose between all your children but if you could choose one top frame that you would be like this is my favorite even if it's for today what would it be? It's it's this one for me this is this is my go-to it's called the Masha split it's actually an OG design it's one of the first 10 designs that we launched and to this day is one that gets the most compliments out on the street and it's always been one of my favorites. Hey how about you and for me I think it would be the design from our Van Gogh collection it was our first artist partnership we brought on and it was a kind of a very new proof of concept like no one had ever put like actual pieces of art and translate at them to I wear which a lot of people said we couldn't do because you know the surface areas so small how are you going to you know do the artist justice and it's done incredibly well it's our second best licensing partnership behind Harry Potter which of course you know you can't be Harry Potter. That's amazing so now I do have to give the students a chance so this one could you maybe help us guide the students in some Q&A? Okay first of all thank you very much guys we are here with the group of Ukrainian entrepreneurs we had this chance to join this lecture at Stanford we are super excited and fascinated thank you so much for sharing your experience your your way into this exciting so my question is that it was actually very interesting to hear about the how do you choose investors and and also that how you guys found out yourself because you are friends and this is great what is next how do you guys where are you going what is the next goal for another five years? Thank you for coming and listening to us all the way from Ukraine so thank you for the question that's an awesome question in terms of looking forward so our vision is to become the Lord's right care company in the world really focus on personalization and today we've been 100% e-commerce in the United States and recently around seven months ago we opened up Canada it was incredibly successful so now our efforts that really in two new kind of verticals for expansion in addition to you know continual expansion here at the United States which is Omni Channel in addition to international expansion so for Omni Channel we've realized that while e-commerce I was fantastic there's still a very large portion of people in the United States that do not purchase glasses on the demographics look very similar to the demographics of consumers that buy online from pair however they just go in get an exam and purchase in person so we wanted to create kind of a first of its kind partnership where an e-commerce company was actually partnering with existing optical retail versus starting our own brick and mortar stores like Warby Parker which can work but is incredibly capital intensive and not necessarily the most profitable way to go so we recently launched a partnership with national vision is the second largest iWR chain here in the United States are publicly traded and the partnerships going incredibly well we're at the top of the link frame in our price category and it's the super serendipitous model where we're able to drive our customers in for iXAMs we're able to acquire new customers and we're even able to get those customers to go online second order of top frames at pairiware.com and we make sure that the cost per gets the same experience over the long end with our limited edition drops and then on the other end of the sphere we're very excited about building a global company and so our value proposition is very unique in iWR there's no one in the world doing what we do which we believe allows us to really grow internationally so we can't say too much but you know for the next few months keep keep an eye out and we prepare expand you know across across board. I think our friends in Ukraine hope you end up Ukraine soon so hey there my question was just about a sort of like your decision-making process since your both since your best CEO's I was just curious like throughout this entire process has like your mission your vision and the values of the company always been the same has ever been any disagreement when you two are trying to make a decision with each other yeah really really great question I would say you know our decision-making process is one that it's very you know as we mentioned earlier focus on just getting to the right answer and solution for the business and for the customers we always keep that at the forefront of how we're making decisions as if you mentioned earlier we're very low ego it doesn't necessarily matter who might be right or who might have the right answer but we're focused on just understanding the problem the question the the best and so we're very data oriented with how we make decisions for the business I would say you know for the mission and vision of the company it's definitely evolved a bunch over time you know we launched in the kid space even you know in our wildest dreams we never thought we'd have ambitions to build one of the largest schoolable I care companies in the world so really the evolution of that is something that you know Sophia and I really build on together and we are in constant communication of you know where do we see the business going how big can we imagine pair being and how do we want to set you know the business the team the structure of the business up to execute on that vision and we're starting very close touch on that so we never really disagree to turn on you know long-term vision and mission of the company because we're just constantly communicating and iterating we've definitely disagreed on you know smaller decisions for the business whether it's you know initiatives and you know I think it always comes back to trying to find the best answer for the and relying on the information that we have from the customer from data you know one of the biggest things that we've made really a large part of the pair culture is being data oriented and data focused and really letting that guide the decisions we make as a business so we'll always use that to inform our decisions and sometimes one of us you know is wrong and then we'll look at the data and like okay yeah looks like this is the decision we should make based off of the data and then we you know go forward from it.
