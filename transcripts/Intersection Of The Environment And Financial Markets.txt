 You were listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at edcorner.stanford.edu. Today, we've got two people who could take the whole time each by themselves, but they happen to be good friends. The first is a colleague of ours here in Stanford Technology Ventures program who also teaches at Cal, who is also a serial entrepreneur here in Silicon Valley, who has started eight startups, and who also has a best-selling high-tech book on marketing that you may remember that Mike talked about last week. This is a fantastic book and one that I recommend to those of you who are interested in figuring out how to create products that customers actually want to buy. So that's the one. Then you may say, Steve Blank, besides being famous and a great professor and a great entrepreneur, what else is he got to his credit? He happens to be, how many years were you a friend of Jesse before? Five years with Jesse Fink. Now, Jesse Fink has also distinguished himself in the world of entrepreneurship in different venues. How many of you have ever used Price Line? Okay, this man is one of the co-founders of Price Line. And how many of you are interested in clean tech ventures of one kind or another, hands up high? In a second or third or fourth or fifth iteration, professionally Jesse actually did something that has been a lifelong passion for him and I believe his spouse. He put together a firm, co-founder to firm that invests in the environment and things that are socially responsible. The name of that firm is Mission Point Capital. So I'm actually not sure what the two of you guys are going to do. All I know is I better get off the stage and let you work your magic, right? Welcome both of you to Stanford. So Jesse, I thought that was a spectacular, confusing introduction for anybody sitting or listening in the audience, trying to figure out how a guy who started Price Line ended up in a company that's doing environmental finance and low-carbon investing. They really don't seem like they're on a career path that won't sign up for it. Stanford, how did you end up from Price Line to getting into this new area? Well, first, let me be a politician. I've been watching so many debates and say thank you, Tom, thank you Steve, and thank you Stanford for having me. That worked. One of us had it. There's a lot that I want to say in these 45 minutes and so I need to make sure that I pace myself because especially when you have two entrepreneurs and you have two marketing folks on the same panel, it's quite possible that we can go off in some really interesting directions and I think whatever we do will be interesting. And we can remove all the oxygen in the air. So I'm not sure how the panels have been handled in the past but hopefully today will be an interesting afternoon for you. I actually have a degree in forestry and so 30 years ago when I was in high school, I was interested in the environment and I was in the 70s and I wanted to make a difference in the world and so I thought going to forestry school was a way to do it. And I went to forestry school and realized that that wasn't going to be a path for me that was going to make the world a better place. I worked for Georgia Pacific as a field forest or cutting down trees that didn't really seem like that was going to save the environment. And so I thought I should go to business school because then I can save the world because it felt like the business was the way things happened. And so I went back to business school and tried to get a joint degree in forestry and business and I was not able to do that but I ended up with a good strong business degree in marketing and took a career in consumer marketing starting off with Citibank. I always, always wanted to go back into the environment. Always felt that at some point in my life I'd go back and do something that would be meaningful. And just had to wait for the timing to happen. Priceline was a phenomenal part of my career. And as a co-founder and chief operating officer it was a once in a lifetime experience. Being in the East Coast there weren't many internet companies back then that aren't like now. But the things that we did in 1995, 96, 98 were the same things that were happening here all the time. But I don't really define myself as Priceline. That was a great opportunity and I'm very proud of everything we built. What it actually, the success of Priceline has enabled me to come back to what my true passion is and why I went to Forestry School. And that's really where I'm spending my time now is the convergence between environmental problems and business and capital market solutions and trying to put those together to solve large-scale environmental issues. And climate change really is the key issue that we're focused on now. Well, before I let you get off the hook on Priceline because I know you want to talk about clean tech. Priceline started in the back woods of Connecticut. It was a start in Stanford. And so here we are and when did it start? We started working on it in 96 and we went out in 98. So there were lots of interesting technology plays in the valley on the web then. So was Priceline just a better airline business or travel business or what was the entrepreneurial story? Priceline, the idea behind Priceline was Jay Walker who was the real of the core founder and the true entrepreneur. Jay put millions and millions of his own dollars into Priceline and did a phenomenal job and was working 100 hours a week trying to really make it a success. Priceline needed technology in order to work. It was a business model. It was technology enhanced not driven by technology. We really were solving two problems. We were solving the airlines problem which is they had a lot of empty seats and they wanted to fill the empty seats but they didn't want to reduce the profit margin that they were getting at last minute from business travelers. And a consumer problem which was people wanted to travel but they really didn't want to pay the fees or the price that the airlines had. So what Priceline enabled to do and the technology behind it was allowing consumers the power to name their own price if you remember early days with William Schattener and still so much right now which is great. But name your own price and the internet enabled it to happen because it in fact we actually conceived the business with paper. And so one of the versions we had was that we would fax this is 1995 that we would fax to the airlines the consumers request for airline takes. You just couldn't work with paper, couldn't work with telephone. So it was enabled by the internet but we were really not a technology company. We needed the net to provide the computing power but really we're solving the consumer problem and it was a business model issue. So I think that's a really interesting observation for entrepreneurs in the room and that Priceline wasn't a technology play. It was an insight about a business model and that I think maybe is the segue into what are you doing now? I mean what is Mission Point Capital and what's the insight about that business? Well it's important to say that Priceline is not a technology really not a pure technology play because people who know me know that I'm not all that savvy on technology so I have make sure they clear about that. Where we are with Mission Point and where we are in solving these large scale environmental issues feel the same way in that the solutions to large scale environmental issues climate change in particular is not going to be solved entirely with technology. Technology and I guess I have to be somewhat careful where I am when I say that but the issues are so large with climate change that technology will enable the solutions but their business model issues there are systematic issues that need to be addressed in order to really solve the issues of the carbon economy that we're in and the transition to a low carbon economy. And so we are based in Connecticut where East Coast based and we look at things we look at technology as an enabler of one of the solutions but we also really look primarily at the capital markets and see how the capital markets and changes in the capital market systems can affect this transition to a low carbon economy. So when I think about clean tech investing I think of solid oxide fuel sales or new thin film semiconductors or solar concentrators or something else and getting a feeling that all those words you just used for the last two minutes doesn't mean that. So what is it that goes on a Connecticut that makes you an investor in this space. So what's an example of the type of difference between East Coast clean tech investing or low carbon investing and what's going on here in the valley. Well the company that we formed two years ago with my partners Mark Srelian, Mark Schwartz, Mission Point Capital Partners is a company we're a private investment firm and we are focused on what we call a transition to a low carbon economy. And we believe that the transition will come from clean energy and environmental finance and it's important to have both of those together. If you, you know, here there's a tremendous effort and it's fantastic towards clean energy technologies. Back East there's a lot with environmental finance and environmental finance is trading carbon credits, environmental commodities. We as a firm look at the intersection of those two. So an example is there's a lot of discussion right now regarding a U.S. carbon and climate bill which hopefully will get past this year. It's called Warner Lieberman if you follow it in the press. And there's discussion about a cap and trade mechanism which is very important putting a cap on carbon and then allowing the markets to trade underneath that. That requires a tremendous amount of an infrastructure, a financial infrastructure to enable companies to trade their carbon underneath that. So we look at the whole financial transaction that has to happen and we will invest through our firm, invest in companies that are involved in setting up the markets so that other companies will have the ability to trade carbon. That to us is as important as investing in solar which we have some investments in solar. We have investments in wind. We're firm believer in renewable energies and cleaner technologies in the core infrastructure. But I think the other part for us is really taking the environmental finance piece of it and marrying it together with the clean energy aspect. So help me understand what are some examples maybe just types of companies if not names that you guys invest in. In the clean energy side, we look at technology companies. So we have invested in a solar technology company and I should say on our website there are a few of our portfolio companies. Most of them we have not put on the website at this point in time. So we are looking at solar technology in the wind sector. We have invested in a surface company. So we looked at wind and said it's great. There's wind farms that need to be built. That's not a business that we're going to get involved in. But all these turbines are being built all over the place. They need to be serviced. And so we invested in a wind service company that is well positioned to take advantage in the growth and the wind business. That's the service business. So technology business, service business, financial service business. And I think that's an area that we spend a lot of time because these technologies get developed and then they need to be deployed out there in the marketplace. And I think that may be a difference that we see is that the issues in clean energy and really trying to solve the problem and climate change is innovation obviously is important but commercialization is equally important. And so how do things get commercialized? They get commercialized by the financial markets and by reducing the cost of capital. And so we spend a lot of time on financial services looking at leasing operations, looking at ways that you can deploy all the great technology that for the most part is being established and developed out here. How do you get it out to the marketplace? How do you get it scaled faster? It's different in the energy business. It's not just putting more servers in. It's not a $5 million to a $10 million to $20 million. You can create a technology and it could be a $200 million install for the first coal plant to actually deploy that technology. That requires a different type of financing than the traditional models that were not in the energy sector. So does your firm have research analysts and financial analysts that follow these markets and figure out where the best place to deploy capital is or do people come to you? We are very research focused. People often ask in our firm who are our competitors. And as far as we know we really don't have anyone that's doing what we're doing. And this is not a commercial for our firm by the means. We built this firm, purposely built the firm, and purposely attracted a team of talented people, some who have a technology background, a policy expert, a market expert, and at the core our investors, our private equity investors. And research is at the core. What we do is we start with what's the customer problem, something that's near and dear to you. What's the problem that we're trying to solve? And how are we going to solve that problem? And so often if you start that way and we look at policy and we look at technology and we look at what are the impediments to rolling out a solution, we will go after, we'll identify a particular company that we feel is well-positioned. We call them platform companies, well-positioned for growth. In some cases that company may not exist. And we may be looking to take a piece of this company, a piece of this company, and put them together to solve the problem. So we are very much research-based. We pay a lot of attention to policy. We pay a lot of attention to what are the customer problems. And we really are focused on solving, which is a huge challenge that we all face. And I hope that there's folks in here who are interested in clean energy or clean tech or whatever sector as you want to call it. Which is actually, I mean, why I'm here is in some ways if I can leave people with just some symbol and said there's huge opportunities from a career perspective. It's so important that there's probably never been a time where the solutions are out there and we just need the smartest people paying attention to solving problems. So this is a commercial for you, for trying to find careers in the sectors. So this sounds like a, almost a great segue to how much is this to make money for your investors and how much is it is your passion? And is it a combination of both or, I mean, you could have set this up as a nonprofit. Hopefully, I won't be one. Look, you know, I, like you Steve, like everybody here, I'm an entrepreneur, I'm a screaming entrepreneur and I want, you know, I feel like these problems, the environment problems are so huge. The only way they're going to be solved is getting the capital markets engaged. And the capital markets you mean not central road? Oh, no, and Sandhill Road is very engaged. It's beyond Sandhill. Beyond Sandhill Road. Yeah, it's getting the bond markets, you know, Sandhill Road, excellent, excellent in supporting and promoting early stage venture firms, later stage, but private equity firms, the whole debt market, the bond market. And I think finding, you know, we look at all the different asset classes from equity to bonds to real estate and look at all the asset classes and as a firm, try to figure out how each of those asset classes can be reoriented so that they make excellent investments in the transition to a low-carbon economy. We are as far from a nonprofit. We work with nonprofits because, and I support nonprofits in every way we can. But nonprofits are there to push the policy and push the solutions. What needs to happen on the other side is there needs to be business and there needs to be solutions. And what we like to think that we're doing is accelerating the solutions and catalyzing the solutions so that the capital markets can be unleashed and solve the problems in a much quicker way than they would have otherwise. So as what you just said is you're betting you could make a pile of money for your investors doing the right thing? Who's that? Look, I'm, well, I hope it's not a bet. I should start by saying, you know, I'm an investor in a pretty significant investor. So, and I go to work every day and I'm there because I believe that we are, you know, we're going to do very well economically. But, and I think we need to because there's a term socially responsible investing. That's not what we are. You know, we're investing. We're doing no different than biotech. You know, I think the folks who are investing in biotech are passionate about that. I would hope they are. And the folks who are investing in Web 2.0, whatever's next, they're passionate about that. I just happen to be passionate about the environment and solving environmental issues and I'm thrilled to be able to have, be part of creating a firm and part of a growing sector that is really focused on, on solving these problems. So why aren't they being solved out here? Those are the monetary parts of, of this problem. Aren't there 10 of you sitting here from 3000 sand to route? Sand Hill, rural views and rural streets. Yeah, yeah, you know, I think that sand Hill Road, there's a model and it's a very successful model that works out here and it needs to work and quite frankly, it's so important in clean energy that it works. But some of the issues that are facing us like coal and coal is not going away and we need to figure out clean coal and how to separate the carbon from coal plants and capture it and sequester it. Those are not going to be venture capital types of funding. You know, those are going to be industrial funding. Those are going to need $50,250,000,000. And so it's an aggregation of capital that is different than the venture model. And so the venture solves a piece of it. I think that things like fuel cells and solar innovation and some of the geothermal, you know, great things and battery technology, great inventions that are happening here. But the commercialization piece of it, how are you getting billions of dollars to come in to do projects? And I think that's a big difference too, is that the length of time to get these solutions going is a lot longer than, you know, typically what the time period is here. And so some of these problems and the solutions actually just don't fit the venture model. The payback is not going to be within that period of time that investors are requiring. Interesting. And you mentioned, you have a policy person on staff. And I've always kind of wondered the impact of policy on deployment of clean technology. Because here in California, I don't know if you know, but there's now a rebate system for solar. And I think last year there was more than 400 megawatts of installed solar. So do you affect policy, follow policy? What's your short and long-term view of? I would say the investments that we make are somewhat, they're not dependent on policy. When we make an investment right now, it's going to be financially sound with the policy as it stands. The option is when policy changes. But as a firm, we study policy very closely and we are trying to influence policy. And I think we all can be, you know, in your influence policy when you vote. But it's so important because the capital markets will only go so far. And policy is what changes and what really moves capital. Capital is very efficient and it will find it. And a good example, a good example of a bad policy, in my opinion, is corn-based ethanol. So there's a policy and it was out there and a tremendous amount of capital went and is still going into corn-based ethanol. It just shows you that when a policy is created, the capital will flow into it. I think that the policy is so important and the investment community needs to pay more attention to policy. I think in the past, we haven't, but especially in the energy industry, it's a regulated industry policy. Crucial. So let me switch from mission point and clean energy to where everybody, at least in this room, and maybe some people listening and watching are, when you were in college. Did you know you were an entrepreneur? I actually didn't know that that's what the term was called. But yeah, I think that I think there's personality that you're born with. I'm not sure it's something that you can grow into. So probably like everybody in this room, well, I'm not sure if you have paper routes anymore, but we have paper routes. You have a jet paper route. I do. In my generation, you had a paper route. And as an entrepreneur, you'd run around, try to figure out how many new subscriptions you can have in your paper route. So I was constantly trying to create new ideas, whether it was in the jobs that I was in or solving other types of problems. Yeah, I mean, that's what I am now. I want to solve problems. And now my focus is solving problems that I have been interested in for the last 35 years. Do you wish you would have done something in college that you didn't do that would have made you a more effective entrepreneur? In college, I met my wife. And I would say that that was the best thing that I did in college. And so I don't know if I would have done anything that might have changed that. You know, I think there's a series of decisions that everybody makes. And when I think about, I chose to go to far school because I was passionate about the environment. I went to business school because I felt like I needed to progress my career. I just made a series of decisions each step along the way. And I would say that the decisions were not, they had a financial component to them, but they were not entirely financial based. They were usually, what can I do next? How can I learn? How can I grow? How can I get more responsibility? And I don't think there's any set career path. I would say that if you could get into a situation where you're actually doing something that is very meaningful to you, you're going to, at least you're going to be more fulfilled. And I think that would lead to success as defined that way. So last couple of questions, Jesse, on your personal life, I know you're kind of involved with nonprofits. But also the screen energy, things, feels also like you're heading in a new direction as well. Is there some intersection somewhere? Yeah, I think one of the challenges that we have is that I talked earlier about financial systems. I think we're at a point now. You can see it in what's being written. You can see it in Bill Gates' speech at Davos last week that you can see it in the things that Google's doing and the Skoll Foundation and all these wonderful individuals and organizations out here for the most part that have realized that there's an opportunity to blend what was philanthropic in nature and what's commercial nature. So we look at it and we do a lot in supporting the nonprofit world. We do a lot, obviously, through a mission point in the commercial side. But there's a space that's in the middle. And I think that's an area that we spend some time in right now in trying to see where does it work? Why does it have to be nonprofit for profit? And up until now, it was really far like that. If you were interested in the environment, forget about trying to go work in a for-profit world. And nonprofits and for-profits were going battling like this. I think that so many great things have happened in the last couple years. There was an organization that was formed last year called USCAP. And it's an organization GE was ahead of it and some great nonprofits and some great other industrial companies coming together now. I think there's 30 companies. And essentially saying that the nonprofits and the business world have to come together to solve some of these issues. So it is really an interesting time where, and nonprofits are hiring business school folks. Because they recognize that they need to have a better sense of the business community, of entrepreneurial community, and putting it all together. So I think that the traditional paths and separate pods are coming together. The last question, how about nonprofits investing in funds like yours? Are they doing that? Or they are starting to do that. Our investor base is a phenomenal investor base. And it does include some foundations, some endowments. There's a whole area that's called mission investing or mission based investing. And that's an area that we spend some time working on as well. And that area is saying to large foundations and endowments families, hey, now you have an opportunity to put capital to work that is aligned with the mission of where you're giving money away. So there are organizations, large environmental organizations that are spending a lot of money, solving environmental issues, and they have an endowment. And then endowment is being used for something that has nothing to do with environment. What needs to happen is financial products need to be established so that endowments and foundations and families and corporations and pension funds have the ability to put their money to work. Again, back to San Hill, those endowments are, they are lead investors in the VC firms and that's fantastic. There need to be other types of financial services that these endowments can put their money to work. Thanks. You know, it just strikes me sitting here and listening to some of the conversation is that what you did with price point making a relative, price line, that was a thing about mission point. Price line, that's a good name though, we should actually come up with a price point. See if we can get William Shatton for that. What you did for price line and creating a new business model and again the Connecticut Backwoods, which in fact 10 years later seems almost intuitively obvious that holy cow you didn't have to build the technology company to do something very unique. Sounds like the equivalent is going on here for energy. That all of a sudden that everything we're doing here in Silicon Valley is the technology base for the things that are going to be new business models. Maybe back east where people have access to capital measured in hundreds of millions and billions of dollars to actually take this technology and deploy it to every household or every company where it's appropriate. And I for me, I think that's the real eye opener or ear opener listening to this story is that in Silicon Valley where some things, particularly at Stanford, where sometimes so insular in the engineering school about technology driven solutions for everything. Just remembering the fact that that technology has to be deployed for it to be successful and to have an effect, at least I'm reducing carbon and we might have just listened to the first and the foremost in that area. So I want to thank you. Is there anything we should have asked you that you think we missed? Should we tell this story of how we met? Yeah, go ahead. So life sometimes has funny twists and turns. Jesse now independently decided to take a vacation with our family of all places to the Galapagos. And when you're stuck on a boat with someone for 10 days, it's either very good news or very good bad news. And the very good news about this story is that I met this other crazy entrepreneur who the only thing he could talk about five years ago was how he was going to change the world in energy investing was drawing diagrams in the little ship lobby as we were bouncing up and then inside and whatever. And we'd come back from a hike and win the islands and he'd be drawing and we'd be sitting in whatever. And the only revenge I got to take on Jesse is five years ago he got to listen to me coming up with this new idea about something called customer development and that book four steps the 50 is I was drawing and he was rolling his eyes. So and the good news is our kids actually like each other and managed to entertain each other when we weren't looking at sea lions and birds and sea turtles. So it's been a great relationship and I think we'll close it and take some questions from the audience. So you just yeah right so question in the back. So I think of investment in energy as being largely not wholly capitalized by the public sector and I think of I guess you know it might be interesting to to look at some examples. I'm thinking about the bond issue that whoops in the Seattle area where they funded five very large nuclear power plants and then that that money didn't work for for the for the energy. The people that got the energy but just you know maybe you can help us understand what the role of public funding is and private investment in energy. So the question if I could repeat it is Jesse what's the difference between public funding like raising bonds for energy plants versus the private investment. You're suggesting that your firm will offer for energy and not just my firm I think that's a great question. I think that there's a combination of both I think the public funding comes in many different ways and some of it is coming in R&D. And that's you know that's an area in the last couple years unfortunately that there's been a shortage of research funding in the energy sector. Hopefully that will change with the energy bill and in the future. But as far as large bond initiatives you need the private sector to jumpstart some of these initiatives and prove out the markets before you can get large scale funding on the private on the public side. And so there's certainly a place in many places for a public and private but there are really some things that I'm talking about are getting the private markets the VC community, the private equity community to fund the companies, fund the development companies so that the public markets could go in and actually fund the projects. You need the entities in order to establish that. So I have for example an example of an example could be in the solar business as it stands right now when large scale utility size solar is now being rolled out and it wasn't. And so that solar has happened and it's in fact we're invested in a company called Sanandasin that is putting solar on rooftops of industrial companies getting to a point where it's utility strength then the public markets will be able to fund those projects but you needed to prove out the model before you can actually get that to happen. Question over. We are improving the model as we've seen at ethanol as failings and develop into infrastructure issues and making ethanol public possible. The environment is just as much now. How did it get to be capital markets favored even though it had so many risks and at the time where the risks are solvable or just like hindsight is 20-20 now that ethanol might not be a good solution. So the question is how did ethanol get where it is if it's so bad. It was the short version of the long question. You know it's interesting we as a firm question early was about research base and we spent a lot of time looking at corn based ethanol and we saw quite a few investments that we could have invested in and and actually done well financially. But chose to pass. I think that people weren't focused on the environmental issues related to ethanol early on. It was getting on the bandwagon of energy independence and so there was a lot of excitement about public policy especially obviously in the corn states to make ethanol be a success and have a victory for energy independence. And they're really at that time there weren't people standing up and really standing up for what the environmental impact was going to be. And I also think with corn based ethanol in particular that people believe that it's the start of biofuels that will lead to cellulosic ethanol which is not as damaging from an environmental standpoint. It's going to be a better from an energy usage standpoint it uses waste in some cases as opposed to food for energy. So I think going into it people believe that corn based ethanol was not the end all solution. You're going to jumpstart it and if enough money went into the markets it would spur which it has a tremendous amount of activity and hopefully that would lead to innovation in cellulosic ethanol which people believe is more of the answer. And just for an engineering class I would remind you you can set up funds and take public businesses which might be incredibly profitable but not necessarily great for the environment or for public health and the markets sometimes do reward them cigarette companies are still in business and quite profitable investments but no one would make the argument that that's anything other than making money at the expense of public health. Earlier Jesse you were talking about this idea of trading carbon credits and you said something about putting a cat. I bet there are a number of people in the audience who just actually don't can't visualize what this is about. Is this like this Chicago Mercatilist James Someday there will be people buying and selling credits. For New York Stock Exchange if you can sort of paint a picture of where it could be in the future maybe what's it like now. I mean it would be really early in the smart. So Tom's question Jesse is can you explain cap and trade in 30 seconds or less. Well you know the best way to explain cap and trade is what happened with the Clean Air Act and sulfur dioxide and in socks and knocks which I think was 10 years ago. It was under first president Bush when there was a cap on emissions and that was primarily from power plants. So essentially there's agreed upon cap and therefore you have to if you are a power plant you need to get your emissions under a certain amount that you agree to. And then there's a trading mechanism that goes in place that allows companies to trade underneath that cap. People say well that doesn't seem right. You know if you if you can't reduce your own emissions you actually can buy a credit the ability to pollute carbon emissions. The whole purpose of cap and trade and what's being discussed now in the Warner Lieberman bill is reducing the cap sets a reduced emissions on carbon that is and there's actually some debate about what that reduction should be. But it's back of lower than what it is right now. But essentially says economy wide we're going to reduce the emissions everyone and then it mandates each business to what their emission level could be. And the purpose of cap and trade and why we supported is that it is forcing everybody to innovate. It's forcing you to to make a decision about cleaning up the or making your energy usage more efficient and investing in that. And if you can't for an economic reason then you have the ability to buy a carbon credit from somebody else who has made that investment. And so the cap just brings the entire emissions down and then the trading mechanism happens underneath that. It's happening in Europe right now under Kyoto. It will happen here in the US and there will be exchanges that are set up you're right on. There will be registries that will set up you know in any type of a market which is what we're excited about any type of market you need all of those market mechanisms to make a market efficient you need to feel that it's credible that it's transparent. And all of those infrastructure pieces will will be developed within the next couple years to support cap and trade. So that's like the Chicago board of trade to curb so hog bellies and carbon futures. Question in the corner. Right. So the question was what kind of financial firms will be supporting these the traditional investment banks or something new? That's a great question. I actually think it's all of the above and I think there's a place for all the above. The traditional financial service companies the infrastructure companies as well as the investment banks will will be a part they are already a part of it. But and you need them because of the credibility and the experience that they have but also is an opportunity for startup companies to come in and play a role. My sense is they will to a certain point and then they will be brought into a larger fold. Good question. Yeah. With this cap and trace that you're talking about I know there's a lot of debate on how it should be initiated on whether the term should be initially auctioned off or should it be with the historical standards of the company's market five to ten years what's your take on? So the question is if you put cap and trade in place should you use historical standards or should you use some others? Yeah. That's a great question and I can't give you a total in-depth answer to it but we believe it or the auction system is the right way to go. There's a real question. There's a lot of money when you do cap and trade. There's a lot of money that can be created and the question is how do you distribute that money? Is there money that's going right to the companies that have created the credits or is there some way to distribute those revenue to other sectors in the economy? Let's take one on this side. Do you see any inherent dangers in combining the non-profit with commercial just because the objectives of the two are very different. So the question was if you're taking money from nonprofits into a for-profit fund can you run into some problems when you do that? I thought it was actually a different question. Oh good. Was that the... Were you talking about the getting the foundation money into a for-profit or were you talking about some? The foundation money and possibly the money given doesn't go to one. The non-profit initiative will run. Okay. Let me answer it just in... Good to answer any question. A non-profit, I don't know how familiar people are with non-profit, but non-profits actually some non-profits have very large endowments. And so they have a responsibility to invest that endowment for returns so that return can fund operations in the future. And they're making investments everywhere. You know, they're probably in most cases they're invested in all different sectors and all different industries unless they've been able to exclude some. So right now if you're running a large non-profit there is the investment side of the non-profit and then there is the operations or the program side of the non-profit. And they're very separate. What I was talking about is that there's so much money that is locked up not so much in the non-profits but in endowments and foundations that are supporting the non-profits. That that money should be unleashed and should be directed to large-scale problems or solutions investments that are consistent with the programmatic activities that that non-profit is doing. I'll give you an example that has nothing to do with energy but the nature conservancy is a good example. It's a great organization. There is, you know, they're in the business of buying large tracks of land from a biodiversity standpoint and holding on to that. People who support the nature conservancy for the most part are supporting the nature conservancy by writing a check so that you can support their operations. What if there was an opportunity that you could invest? So investors could support the nature conservancy in a different way. They can support them by owning a piece of the land or having an investment vehicle and so that that money from an investor's perspective was not going out in the form of a donation but was being recycled in the form of an investment. And that may not have actually clarified your answer in your question. Get a little stand here until you get your support. Yeah, but I do want to make one thing clear. The work that I'm doing is not non-profit. You know, we support non-profits through our philanthropic efforts and other activities where I spend my life is very much for profit. It's very much commercial and I'm a firm believer that the solutions need to come from the commercial side and the investment side that can then support the hard work and great work that non-profits are doing. Question in the middle. The initial clean tech investors invested on a belief that there would develop a need for the clean tech technology or what have you. Are we getting to the point where it's becoming attractive to anyone, no matter whether they're skeptic about the environment or they believe in global warming or not that there's just the one bottom line and not a triple or double that they can feel confident investing in. So the question was, boy, I'm not so. Help me again. No, the question is early investors in this sector may not have been as return focused as they were trying to move things along from a mission perspective per se. And you're, and has that changed and you're absolutely right. If you look at just the volume of capital that's going into the market and you look at the companies that were funded 15 years ago, 10 years ago, and their investors, it was not mainstream investors. What's happened is that people have recognized that these are great investments and it doesn't matter if you believe in climate change, if you believe in a low carbon economy, you could sit there and pencil it out and say, you know what, this is a great investment, this is a great company and I'm going to get a return. And I think that's the best thing that can happen because it then opens up a whole set of investors that don't have to feel a certain need or conviction. They're doing it from a return perspective. That's important because that's just getting more and more capital in the markets as more capital comes in the markets than more entrepreneurs like you say, look, you know what, if I'm going to go invent something and I'm going to go create and I'm going to go start a company, why not start it in this sector? It's as attractive and could be as financial rewarding as the next web product, but you know what, there's something else that's going on here too. So I think it's an exciting time for that to happen. I also think that what's changed recently is the recognition that we can fuel the economy. I think you could just, you could hear it with the different politicians in the last week talking about the green economy and 5 million green jobs. And so instead of feeling like there's this trade-off in clean energy that you're going to have to give up something, I think there's a real sense of optimism now that it is the next new economy. That there's a lot of jobs that can be created. There's a lot of careers that can happen. There's a lot of wealth that can be created for the entrepreneurs and for the investors. And I think for the first time, there's a lot of people that believe that the jobs that are created are going to be created right in the community. There's a gentleman Van Jones who's out of Oakland that is talking a lot about green jobs, green job core, and you should check him out. But what's neat about what's happening now is if you're going to put solar panels up, you can't outsource the installation. And so there's a huge opportunity right now for jobs to be happening in the community, for jobs to be in Oakland, in areas where there really aren't many other opportunities. So, and you could see it. You could see what's happened in the energy bill. There was a fair amount of money that was put into create jobs. It really, it's the fueling of a new economy. And I think that the fact that there's a new service community that needs to be built out for the installation of clean energy for the servicing of clean energy. I hope that it's an opportunity to kind of kickstart the economy. Large scale automobile manufacturing, I can't tell you whether it's coming back or not. But I will tell you that putting solar panels on, you're happening. The amount of people who are getting new jobs that are created from the green economy is large and it's growing. So, it's a real optimism that's happening out there. So, if you throw my two cents in on that one just quickly is any time a Web 20VC feels a need to have a clean energy investment portfolio, you realize that this has become mainstream and Silicon Valley in San Diego Road. It's your embarrassed nowadays if you're a venture capitalist, at least a full service VC and you don't have a couple of portfolio companies in this space. And that's either the continuation of the lending effect or wisdom depending on the returns in a couple of years. Let me just add on to that too. I think what's so exciting is that each of the asset classes are being mobilized to solve these problems. It starts with the venture capital community and it's very exciting what's happening right here. And then you start looking at Wall Street and you see Citicorp saying $50 billion they're going to be putting towards clean energy. Goldman Sachs, who's been an incredible investor in this sector. So, all of the large investment banks are investing, they're talking about it. And I'm surprised I haven't mentioned this before but energy efficiency is a huge, huge opportunity. And that's an area that has been underserved, under-invested. It's not quite as sexy as the next fuel cell or solar. But it is right here. Right now, green buildings can be retrofitted. And there needs to be so much more emphasis put on energy efficiency because it's right here. And it's not a trade-off of dollars. Those are dollars that will be returned immediately given the savings on the energy side. So, cap and trade from what I understand it mostly applies to industrial settings. Is there been any talkers, anything in place of a residential cap and trade where a person can build a clean building or install solar panels. Another than just getting a lower electric bill by less usage. But in the additional financial incentive, maybe the people are using exceptional amounts of energy. They can, their forces sort of kick something back to those guys who are using very little. So, the question is, is there ever been a notion or proposal for residential cap and trade in addition to the industrial cap and trade that's proposed? Yeah, there's, I mean, a lot of people talk about that. I think that the low-hanging fruit is industrial emissions. And so, that's where the focus has been. But there are other incentives, Steve can talk about it too, to encourage you to make that investment in solar and in renewable energies. And I mean, you have had personal experience with that. I just literally, yesterday signed a contract for a solar installation in our house. And I have to tell you the payback now is about seven years. And if you're thinking about being a long-term homeowner, that is instead of just flipping houses, which nowadays probably isn't a good idea, that's a pretty good payback. And it's a pretty good payback. Even if you were just doing it on dollars and cents, let alone just trying to figure out what's good for the environment. So, yeah, I don't think there'll be a cap and trade in my opinion. It would be a long time before we see that. But there'll be enough economic incentives for both consumers who have already installed and builders. I think what we've done in California with PG&E and also AB32 in California, that's going to drive some of these things on a statewide level to much lower level. So, the question is, what's the relationship to the big utilities and the small companies that Mission Point Capital might want to fund? Well, the utilities now need to buy, need to create renewable power. So, there has been a real awakening. It's happening on a state-by-state basis, California, the lead. But it's probably in 20 states at this point in time and there's a push on the national level. So, utilities need to work with independent operators to find sources of renewable power. So, there is an acceptance in a very positive way because it's going to solve their demand needs for power. But I mean, that's a good question. I think one of the things that is changing right now too is that there's people are starting to recognize decentralized power. And so, industrial companies are recognizing that they can create, I mean, they've some have been doing this for a long time, but even smaller companies that they can create their own power at different times of the day be less reliant on the grid. So, Jesse, I really appreciate you coming out from Connecticut and coming here to talk to us. We also want to mention the fact that your son is here at Stanford as well, and sitting in the audience. We want to bring that up. And so, thank you very much and it was great talking to you. Thank you. Thank you, Randy.
