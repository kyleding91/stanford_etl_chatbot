 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these elections online at eCorner.stanford.edu. It is my pleasure today to introduce our speaker, Warren Packard. Very interesting connections with Stanford. And you'll hear his story today. But he was a student here several times, both in the engineering school and over in the MBA program. Some of you might have even been his freshman advisees because there's a few. I've been a freshman advisor for several years and really enjoyed it. But for a few select people who are not professors, like Warren, they're invited to join that program. So he has been doing freshman advising for many years, many years. And that's a nice connection. He's also, as you might imagine, given the nature of his company he's going to talk about a little bit today. He's a big sports fan of Stanford's sports, including football and basketball. He's been really kind in working with STVP, one of the sponsors of this series over the years. I have to say, when I think of looking at the student feedback who were people who had participated in the Mayfield Fellows Program, he's always one of the top VC mentors because each one of the Mayfield Fellows gets a VC mentor for the year. And they're always talking about how wonderful Warren was to them when he was a venture capitalist. Because that's the other interesting connection here. He was a venture capitalist for a few years, quite a few years, with Draper Fisher, Jervinson. So there's another connection. But right now, he's co-founder and CEO of a startup called Thuse. So without further ado, let's welcome Warren to Stanford. It's great to be here. And it's actually fascinating to be here. I almost went over to Terminoditorium to give this lecture. And it's a big hole in the ground. Obviously, you guys know that. Things have changed a lot. And in fact, when I first got here on campus, I got here in 1985. I was driven around by some folks who actually had a car. And we went around campus drive, which by the way was slightly different, or at least the roads were configured differently back then. And we were looking around at all the construction. And we were like, wow, there's so much construction around here. This construction is going to end in like a couple of years. And then Stanford will be done. And I'm glad to see that I was right about that. It's incredible, all this. As Tom so nicely mentioned, I'm the founder of a company called Thuse, which is in the sports space. And I'll try very hard not to be shamelessly promoted about that. But it will, I'll definitely touch upon it a number of times throughout this talk. But I have to start off with a sports question, of course. So number one, who watched the Super Bowl? All right, excellent. Number two, who enjoyed watching the Super Bowl? Pretty good game as it was. So let's get to more broader picture. Who watches sports center here? All right, a few less people. Who enjoys watching sports center? All right, so you get your fix of sports. So one more final question. When you watch sports in sports center, do you ever go, wow, I wish I'd watch that game, or at least the ending of that game. Like the last five minutes of that game, or the last 10 minutes of that game, or the incredible comeback or whatever. Do you ever have that feeling? Well, that's what Thus is all about. We're actually taking a whole bunch of information that's out there. And we're compiling in real time the excitement level of every professional and college sporting event that's out there. And we actually do the same thing for the individual athletes who are competing in these games as well. So if you're busy, you're doing your problem sets, you're in your study groups, you're eating whatever, you'll get a notification and say, hey, great game. Watch this one. Again, 15 minutes left to go in X, or two innings left to go in Y. You'll be able to tune in, take a study break, gather your friends around, seeing an amazing conclusion to a game. And you won't have to take the risk, so to speak, of tuning into a game for three and a half hours or letting it distract you. Because of course, you guys are focused on those problem sets, group projects, and things like that. But that's what we're all about. We're taking a whole bunch of interesting information, turning it into real time data so that you guys can have fun watching sports. And it's, in fact, exploring sports that you might not have otherwise watched. And more of this will come out about foods. But underpinning everything that we're doing is statistics. Because we're taking objective data about these games, and we're manipulating it and turning into a single value about excitement. Turning it into a subjective sentiment or measuring a subjective sentiment. So this gets me to the next set of questions here. Because I just mentioned statistics. Who here has taken statistics? All right, quite a few folks. Who here has taken calculus? Quite a few more. Show hands. Who likes calculus better? Who likes statistics better? Who doesn't like either? Okay. Okay, I'll just make a determination that you guys said that. Calculus is much more interesting than statistics. And that's typically the reaction, although I didn't count all the hands. I'll just assume that was the case. But our business is all founded upon statistics. And the point that I won't, well, that I will make without making any defense behind it is that life is statistics. Life is not calculus. Calculus is all about perfection. Assume a frictionless surface, assume this, assume this, assume this, then you can integrate or do whatever you want. And you'll get the right answer. But it never plays out like that in reality. Because reality is statistics. Reality is probabilistic. It's non-deterministic. And so in our business, we're all about exploiting non-determinism. You don't know the outcome of the game. You don't know if the game's going to be exciting. Yet you still want to know. You still want to know if it's worth your time to tune in. Are you going to miss? Why should I watch the highlight when I can watch the real game? But I don't want to tune into the real game because it might not be interesting. So there's a lot of things in life that are uncertain. We're exploiting that. But all of you who are clearly on an entrepreneurial path are also exploiting uncertainty. Because what I will posit here and the whole premise of my talk is that determinism has very little role in entrepreneurship. It has a lot of a role or a big role in engineering. And many of you, most of you, are engineering majors. But when it comes to entrepreneurship, entrepreneurs seek out uncertainty. They exploit uncertainty. And uncertainty is your life. And so what I want to do, actually speaking of life, is I'm going to go through a little bit of a chronology of my background and how I got to where I am today. And in so doing, I'm going to explore a bunch of uncertainties, a bunch of trade-offs. And hopefully there will be some gems and pearls of winces to them. Some of these things are going to be very obvious to you. And I'll hopefully point those out. Other things are going to be not so obvious. The bottom line, of course, is there are no right answers because everything is uncertain. But as an entrepreneur, you're going to be faced right in front of you, right in front of your team, right in front of whatever task you have at hand with uncertainty. And so as much as you want to go out there and say, I'm building X or designing Y or whatever, and it's going to be the best thing inside you're going to be saying to yourself, I'm not really sure. And I guess maybe one of the key takeaways of this talk is it's okay to be uncertain because you should be uncertain. But me talking today in front of you, I'm actually uncertain what I'm going to say right now. I've got, this is my talk right here, but it'll come out some way, a lot of uncertainty. And I'm going to tell you about my time in the venture capital business, lots of uncertainty. And I'm going to tell you a lot about FUS and tell you how it's going to be the greatest thing. I'm uncertain. So let's start, we'll kick this off. I don't have any props, I don't have a presentation. So hopefully these things will be easy to keep in your mind. But I started out, as I already mentioned, at Stanford in 1985, an undergraduate. And this is actually a good place to start our story because this was my first time west of the Mississippi River, come from Illinois originally. And when I came to Stanford, obviously you meet a diversity of people and it's absolutely fascinating. New environment, everything's new, everybody's uncertain obviously. But one of the things that I didn't realize at the time, that when I stepped foot on Stanford campus, I'd be sewing the seeds for the founding team of FUS. And it's actually, it's a wonderful story in that when I first thought of these ideas, I was sitting back watching a football game a couple of years ago. My first thought wasn't to talk to some entrepreneurs that I backed at DFJ. I'd been in the venture business for 13 years. And my next thought wasn't to think about the business school and think about all my colleagues that I met there. And they're fantastic colleagues there, fantastic folks I've worked with at DFJ. My first thought was right back to my undergraduate experience in Stanford. I pulled in my freshman RA to meet my VP of engineering. I pulled in a buddy of mine who married a classmate, actually Dean Julie's husband. For those who know Dean Julie. And for those who know our husband. As my other co-founder, the three of us started this company. The fourth guy to join us as a co-founder was my class at Stanford. And so this core group of founding individuals all came from my undergraduate days at Stanford. These were folks that I had stayed in touch with. We hadn't, maybe we had worked together, maybe we hadn't, but whatever we had stayed in touch together. And it was a great network. And it brings up this first kind of conflict or balance or tension, if you will. And this is an easy one. This is a layup. The tension is between what is more important when starting a venture. Is it the team? Or is it the idea? And along with the idea, you can say is that the market is that the opportunity is that the business is at the technology. But team and everything else. And in all my experience at DFJ for 13 years. Team, team, team. And my experience with FUS right now, having now run this business for, it depends on how you count. It's all uncertain, but a year plus, it's all about team. And no matter where we go with this business or how successful or unsuccessful we are with this business. This journey is going to be fantastically rewarding because of the people that I'm surrounded by. And the people who have joined this venture. And like I said, this is a layup because I think a lot of you have had this ingrained in you. As time goes on, the venture does become more about the market, more about the product, more about the defense building, all those things that come to bear. And you have to really focus on. And you're going to hire more and more people and you'll lose touch with, you know, employ number 81. I can't remember who that is. But right now, it's all about team. And it really makes this experience fantastic. But there is always some tension between what should lead the charge. And I would say if you're thinking about starting a company, think about your team. Think about your team first, especially if you don't have that opportunity in front of you. Or if you have that opportunity in front of you, think about who would be the best folks to join you in that venture. So that's my Stanford undergrad. It can be encapsulated in meeting great people and then roping them into my startup company many, many years later. While I was an undergraduate at Stanford, I spent the summer at Hughes Aircraft Company. Actually two summers at Hughes Aircraft Company. It's probably called Raytheon now or something. It's done in Southern California. And while I was there, one of the projects that I worked on was called the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program. Basically a big weather satellite for the military and also for consumer use. I worked there with a guy named Lou Gomburg who was a aged veteran of the satellite business. And had a great experience for the summer. I do all sorts of things which I can't exactly recall now. But what I do recall is at the very end of the summer, he put his arm around me and said, Warren, gosh, you did a really good job. Thanks, Lou. You know, you could be the program manager of this when it launches in 2013. Thanks, Lou. That's great. And Lou, of course, thinking about this. And by the way, I haven't changed the names to protect the innocent. So, thanks, Lou. I was thinking to myself, you know, in a way that was the absolute worst thing he could ever say to me after a summer of work at Hughes. I mean, I can't come back to this. But the other thing is the absolute best thing that happened to me because it immediately informed me that I can't come back to this. It wasn't for me. And it brings up tension number two, if you will. And tension number two is perfection versus imperfection. And the fact that in the satellite business, you don't have many shots. You don't want your satellite blowing up in space or not working or functioning once it's in space. It's got to work. And so the things that we were designing into that satellite in 1987 were things that had been tried true and tested for the past 10 years. So if you do the math here or just think about times, in 1987 we were designing a satellite for 2013 that was designed with equipment built and tested in 1977. And it was all because it had to be perfect. And of course, it was going to be changed over time. But we were still designing the satellite. And I don't even know if the satellite's going to be launched next year. It's actually coming up. I should celebrate it or go to the launch. Or maybe the program has been canceled. But there are some businesses that require perfection. And there's other businesses that require imperfection. And of course, if you're in the medical device world, you got to get closer to the perfection side of things. And of course, that's why medical device companies and pharmaceutical companies are very different these all together. But if you're designing an app or web experience or whatever, obviously imperfection is a great tool to have. It's kind of like, I don't know if you guys call it this anymore, but the God of partial credit. You're doing a problem set. You get 75% correct. At least you got 75%. And you didn't get 100% of the answer wrong even though the answer was wrong. God of partial credit works for you in spades as an entrepreneur. And you have to use that as a tool to get out, get your product launched, get customer feedback, learn from your mistakes, pivot, and do it again, and iterate and pivot and iterate and pivot. And it's all about embracing imperfection. Again, I don't think this is anything new, but you're going to have some experiences where you're going to have to be perfect. And identifying those scenarios and differentiating that from other scenarios is extremely helpful. And it also has to do with risk taking and risk avoiding. Again, entrepreneurs are taking huge risk. And at TFJ, we were trying to take huge risk. And we did a really good job, I believe, of doing that. But at the same time, we had a portfolio of companies that we were backing. And by having a portfolio of companies, we were clearly in the risk avoiding position. We knew that of a portfolio, let's say, of 20 companies, only a couple of these companies were actually really going to take off and be hugely successful. So we knew that out of 20, 18 were not going to do, well, they do fine, let's say. But two, two, we're going to make the whole fun. So that's the balance between risk seeking and risk avoiding. You have a portfolio of companies. You have a portfolio of risk seeking companies. Now as the CEO of a startup company, we're taking a heck of a lot of risk. But at the same time, we're also taking in other people's money. In the moment you take in other people's money, you have to realize that you have to start avoiding risk to a certain degree. And we'll get back to this later because I really do want to make money for my investors. And as a consequence, the more I really want to make money for my investors, the more I don't want to lose money, the more I don't want to go out of business. And that's not a healthy thing for an entrepreneur. A entrepreneur should want, you know, be going for it and just, you know, I bet the company every week or I bet the company every month. You still have to balance these things out. And so when somebody says, you know, somebody gives you money and says, hey, you know, take that risk. That's great. That's nice, but there's a lot of stakeholders. Oh, yeah, there's employees. Not just investors, employees. Our fifth, the fifth person we brought on, and we brought this individual on as a founder, he came to me one day, he said, weren't I selling my house? I'm like, great. That's cool. Why are you selling your house? He goes, I want to have enough money to last this startup phase. I'm like, that's really scary. You're selling your house. And I'm thinking to myself, you know, and this was at a time when we were all part time, because again, risk seeking, risk avoiding, we didn't actually jump into this venture full time from day one. We were going to test the waters. We were going to figure it out. And here's this guy coming to me, I'm selling my house and I'm like, don't sell your house until we're all committed. And in fact, this turned out to be the forcing function for getting our company full time, full speed ahead. He, you know, in fact, I don't think he ended up selling his house. God, man. Anyway, but he forced us in the right direction. We have no regrets whatsoever. So anyway, somehow I got to that out of Hughes Aircraft Company. So, after Hughes Aircraft Company, well, that was one of my summers. After my undergraduate days, I got a, I went to coach arm here. I got a master's and I did the smart product design, ME218 program here. Anybody in that program here? Yeah. All right. You're a glutton for punishment. Actually, all these programs are great. And punishing. So one of the things about was 218 and actually really specifically about my research that I did while I was here as a master's student. So I did work in the robotics lab of Professor Mark Kakowski. And one, I learned a really big lesson there because going into the research, you're suddenly becoming a specialist. Up to this time, I was mechanical engineering. What is mechanical engineering? It's lots of things. And if I loved mechanical engineering because it was lots of things. But then suddenly you're doing research and we weren't just doing robotics research. We were doing grasping and manipulation of robotic hands. Oh, and even more so we were doing slip sensing of robotic fingers. And you know, you could keep going down and down until, into the minutia not to be pejorative at all. But it gets very specific. And it really started opening my eyes to the fact that at some point in my life, I'm actually going to have to decide what I do. And I need to figure out am I a specialist or am I a generalist? Or maybe I don't really have to figure it out, but I've given this a lot of thought. And this brings up another story because in very soon I'll talk to you about, or tell you about my time at Baxter Healthcare Corporation, which was my first job out of college. And while I was at Baxter, I had the pleasure of working with an amazing engineer named Dean Kamin. And you might know Dean because he's done all sorts of fascinating things like the Segway Scooter. And he's the guy who started US First Robotics Competition. Done a number of different things. But he's an amazing engineer. And so I was working with him. He was designing the next generation kidney dialysis machine. And I was designing the next next generation kidney dialysis machine. And I realized that he was good. Like as much as I was like, oh, I'm doing this cool, wizzy wig technology kind of stuff. Actually wizzy wig is totally the wrong word. Cool technology. He would always know more than me in terms of what I was doing. Like he could come over and look over my shoulder. In fact, Mark Kusky did the same thing. It was eerie. I'd be like in a lab for 56 hours straight. And he'd come in the next day, kind of look over my shoulder and go, you forgot that. How the heck do you know that? And Dean would do the same thing. He'd look over my shoulder. And he's, you know, you're doing something wrong or whatever. But it was then that I really grok the whole notion that he was a specialist. Like if you ask him about, you know, hey, he lives in New Hampshire. You know, how are those New England patriots today? You look at me and go, basketball? And if you say, hey, do you see that cool movie, you know, Terminator, you know, and he go, movie? And it occurred to me that he had invested his life into being, and he's not mono-dimensional, I'm exaggerating. But, you know, into doing all these things over here and not doing these things over here, he had decided that he was going to be darn good at this stuff. And he could care less about this stuff or maybe whatever. But I couldn't do that. I wanted to watch the patriots, well, I wanted to watch the 49ers. Okay, really, I wanted to watch the Bears because I'm from Chicago, but that's besides the point. And I wanted to go to movies. And I wanted to, you know, blah, blah, blah. I couldn't get it out of my head that I was a generalist. And as much as I wanted to be, you know, like at every point in my life, I want to be this person, I want to be this person or this person, I couldn't be those people. I had to be me. And me was a generalist. And so this wasn't very interesting tension because I wasn't necessarily comfortable with the outcome of this. But I had to be because I just couldn't be something I wasn't. And it was just an interest, again, uncertainty. You suddenly, you realize that there's these things out there that you can make decisions. But there may be something inside you that's preventing you from doing something. I couldn't stop watching sports. I couldn't stop watching movies collecting records with that old school, right? In any event, and it was, this was a realization I first got when getting into the master's program because they're your focused. And it's interesting. I had an interesting choice a couple years into my masters. Well, I guess I did actually get the masters. I had a choice whether to go on for a PhD or not. And in fact, it was kind of like, sure, I'll go on and get a PhD. And now I'll teach. And that was kind of like what I saw in front of me. But my girlfriend at the time said, hey, I'm going to med school, no, no. I said cool. And she said, I want to come. And suddenly I had to make a decision. And again, it gets back to uncertainty, right? I mean, like, should I follow my girlfriend to Illinois, back to Illinois, just serendipitously, she happened to be going to Stanford from Illinois. And what would I do? In fact, this was 1991. In 1991, the economy was really bad. And so there were very few jobs here in Silicon Valley. There were probably even fewer jobs in Illinois. But as I already mentioned, I already gave the punchline. I ended up working for Backstreet Healthcare Corporation, getting completely lucky that I landed a job that was really, really interesting. And like, I fainted at the sight of blood. And I was in the renal division doing dialysis machines, which is absolutely the worst possible thing. But I got over it. My first interview at Backstreet, they flew me out there. I walked into a lab and there's literally a jug of bovine blood there. And I walked out of the room immediately. I kind of collect myself. And I hear the guy who was taking me around, introducing me. This is Warren Packard from Stanford. Warren. But I didn't kill over. I just went in the hallway and collect. And then I walked right in and it was OK. But uncertainty. So the question that popped up or the tension that popped up is this whole tension between chance and planning or luck and planning or whatever it might be. I did not plan, you know, when I started my Stanford career to go to Illinois six years later with my girlfriend. I did not plan to get into the medical device design business. I did not plan. There's a lot of things I didn't plan. But this was a huge decision point in my life. And yet I was leaving it all up to chance. And I'm assuming, well, OK, I'm just truth, candor. I'm anally attentive. I like planning. I like organizing. You know, like when I got my freshman book, whatever they call it, Stanford, I was planning out my major. I didn't even know I didn't really know what I wanted. And then every year, you know, what courses do I have to get my GREs? How do I do this, whatever? I was planning. And then suddenly I'm uprooted thrust until I'm in. Or back to the line. I guess that was somewhat comfortable. But again, it's all about luck versus or chance versus planning. And again, there's nothing that says one's right or one's wrong. But this whole notion that you can take a very organized and planned life and suddenly uprooted and hope that something's going to come out of it that's actually valuable is a very interesting one. So I ended up not getting a PhD. I ended up working in industry. And in working in industry, I learned a lot about business as much as they let me out of the lab. But from there, I applied to business school. And because I knew somewhere in the back of my head, I actually had to have some notion of business and be a good thing. So I applied to the GSB. And I was fortunate enough to get in here. And one of my first classes in the GSB was organizational behavior. And here I am an engineering student taking organizational behavior. We're learning about people. What's with this? I mean, gosh, there's accounting and there's cash flow analysis. And there's entrepreneurship. There's lots of things that we could be doing that's more important than organizational behavior. And I guess this might be one of the things that's been pounded down. But of course, people as the foundation of the business and I already talked about that is tension number one between team and market or whatever. That team is so important. But the culture of your company is absolutely pivotal. And here I was the first quarter or was it a semester or whatever, a business school. And learning about organizational behavior and really not having an appropriate context for it. But it was a very interesting experience to get the most important class right up front. And the story I guess that I'll tell around that is going forward fast-forward to foods. Because right now, as we think about culture, we are struggling with how do you put a culture into a company? What should that culture be? And how's it differ from other cultures that are out there and what we want to actually end up doing? And one of the interesting things about our company that differs from Facebook or other companies that are started by younger individuals is we're an old company. You've got guys like me that are there. So it was founded by a few 40-year-olds there. And the question is, well, what happens when we start diversifying this population? Is a, diversity is key for us not having group think and getting more ideas and having just all sorts of things as you guys know. But how do we attract folks that are out of college that want to, I don't know, work from 11 in the morning to one in the morning? And how do they put up with the fact that we have kids and we actually work from this time to this time, we want to go home and have dinner with them and then we want to work on our PC at home. It's something actually, this is a real uncertainty, it's a real tension. But it's not something we could plan out. Again, chance would have it that we started a company when we were not 20 years old. And then the other question that occurred to us is like, are we going to be advantaged because we've got all this experience? Or are we going to be disadvantaged because we actually already know some things we shouldn't do? And it's actually that childlike curiosity. I don't mean that pejorative. That allows you to do things that others simply won't do. Are we going to be just too planned and perfect, again, not to take that to an extent, but planned and perfect and we're going to miss the cool opportunities, whereas those who are more youthful will just, yeah, I'm going to do that. If I think about Napster, I mean Napster got in a ton of trouble for what it did, but it was the start of a revolution in the home music business. Pretty amazing what they did. And a lot of the things they did because they didn't know better. They didn't know otherwise. So there's attention there. Again, there's no right answers, no wrong answer. But we're getting more and more younger individuals into the company and it's absolutely fantastic. Because that is a skill set that we need. But we have to think about culture. How do you bridge a culture when, again, there's different work habits and different work styles? Again, no answer. I'm not coming with that. But obviously, I guess underpinning all of this is there's absolutely no doubt that having this diversity within the company is going to make us absolutely, much stronger organization. But anyway, so that came from the GSB in terms of organizational behavior being right in front of us. Another class that we took there, how many have heard of Touchy Feeley at the GSB? This is a very fuzzy class. Did you guys still use the term fuzzy? Yeah. Good. Not totally out of it. And what Touchy Feeley really taught us is that there's a lot of intuition that comes into what we do. And again, as an entrepreneur, intuition is absolutely paramount. In your engineering classes, you're dealing with a lot of fact. The intuitive part is absolutely critical for an entrepreneur. And again, that's not going to be any surprise to you. We value intuition as an venture capital firm. We value intuition at a startup company. There's very little facts to go on, but that's just underpinning what's going on there. While I was in the GSB, I started a company. And the company was called Ingara, database systems. A buddy of mine was still getting his PhD, even after I had gone to Illinois, come back, gone to business school. And he had this technology. And this actually just presents the age-old tension of, is it the product that matters? Or is it the problem that matters? And this was a classic case of a solution looking for a problem to solve. And again, luck played a huge role in this because we started this business in 1996. And you might recall 1996 was just about this time that the internet was taken off. And Netscape had gone public in 95. And people were just trying to figure out what this Yahoo and Infosseek and Excite stuff were. But we started a database company, which had nothing to do with the internet. But again, in terms of uncertainty, we had no idea what problem we were going to solve. All we knew is that this guy did his PhD dissertation on this particular type of database, and that perhaps we could help out somebody else in the enterprise space. Probably the company pivoted and went forward as a marketing information system for internet companies, basically doing real-time marketing. So again, keeping your eyes open to those problems that are good for your solution makes a lot of sense. But I would say that starting with a problem is usually a much more helpful thing to do. But again, you're surrounded by great solutions here. And so being able to exploit a solution is obviously that perhaps has the least friction in terms of taking you to the next level. With those, it was all about identifying the problem. And my problem was very personal. I just didn't have the time anymore to spend three hours sitting in front of a game that wasn't very interesting. Because I had turned down the bears against the 49ers, my two-fraver teens, and an hour in I was like, wow, this should be a great game, but it wasn't. And then my mind wandered and I was like, OK, how could somebody have told me this was a great game without belonging the ending? And then I started thinking, oh, I can look at these statistics and this and this and this. And next thing we started a company. So that was a problem looking for a solution. Within GARA was the opposite way around. But again, luck caught up with us. And we got to pivot right into the internet space, which was a great place to go. So I'll fast forward to DFJ. DFJ was a phenomenal experience. I joined the firm in 97. And of course, again, the internet was just taking off. So we had all this, the wind behind our sales. We were focused on the internet back to a whole bunch of very interesting companies while we were there. And one of the things, the tennis that we've told our entrepreneurs that you have to be focused, you've got to be focused. Because there's too much to do. You don't have enough resources. You've got to get things done. You've got to be focused. But in the same breath, DFJ's mantra is, you've got to change the world. And it's, again, it's a very interesting tension because between changing the world and focus is a lot of room. And if you're going to change the world, how can you be focused? Because you can be so focused, you become irrelevant. On the other hand, if, you know, if, well, vice versa. And so it's a very interesting tension. If you ask DFJ folks, they'll lead with change the world. Because venture capitalists want that incredible home run hit. They want the buy-dues of the world and the skips of the world and the hot males of the world to be in their portfolio. And those are change the world opportunities. But as an entrepreneur, you need to focus. And there's tension there. Because you've got, on the one hand, somebody's saying change the world. And on the other hand, a lot of people are saying, if you don't focus, you're not getting anywhere. You've got to start somewhere. You've got to get a beach head. You've got to expand from your beach head. So you'll get advice on both sides of the table there. And again, it's uncertain. There's no firm answer in terms of how you're supposed to approach this. In a way what you're supposed to do is juggle both. Which makes life as an entrepreneur very difficult. But we never told you it was going to be easy. At THU's, we're actually doing a 2-pronged strategy. We have our own consumer apps that you can get in the App Store and the Marketplace. So go ahead and do that after my talk. But we also have partnerships that we're building with the industry incumbents. We're actually working with folks like ESPN and CBS and Comcast and Dish and T-Mobile and Sprint and these big behemoths. And they are through their channels. We can create a very large company that has impact for their customer base. But also at the same time, we need to learn about our customers and do some things that we have control over. And that leads us to developing our own applications and building up our own customer base. We're not in competition with each other but just because there's this tension between focus and doing something that's huge and really big. And you need both. And this is very, I mean we're stretched. There's no doubt we're making trade-offs here that others might not make. And again, there's no right decision. And people will give you advice on one side or other side. You just have to realize you're going to be faced with this uncertainty. The other element where there's no right answer is speed versus patience. And while I was at DFJ, I backed a company called X-FIRE which was a social network for gamers. And this was a company founded by and run by a guy who's a phenomenal entrepreneur in a micacidate. And Mike gives a great talk and you might have seen it about speed. Speed is everything. And when Mike talks to you, listen. He's done it before. He's had four successful companies. So you might as well listen to him. I listen to him. And speed is absolutely paramount on what we do. And everybody, there's many reasons for speed. But all the same, there's an element of patience that is required in entrepreneurship that is really, really important. Because if we were just in control of our own destiny, we could do speed up the hill. If it was just our mobile apps, if it was just our connected TV app, it was just us, we can go really fast. But when it comes down to it, if you're going to work with partners and your partners are going to help propel you into something bigger, you need to have. Patience. Because these guys are not going to be moving very fast. And so again, between what is obviously great advice, which is speed, there's this counterpoint of patience, which you need to keep in the back of your head. And it's going to be, this is attention that kills us. Because when you're talking to these partners, they do the darnedest things. They make decisions that you just can't believe that they're making. And they switch up staff left and right. You know, talking to one person one day and the next person next day and there's a rift the next day and a reorg the next day, that's okay. It just happens. You have to understand there's a lot of patience that goes into what you're doing. Things just don't happen as fast as you always think. Another great tension that we learned from investing internationally at DFJ is global versus local. And this comes up a lot here. And I think this is actually captured in that saying that you need to think globally, I've got to be careful if I say that the wrong way. It's a global economy. There is no doubt that whether what's going to happen with the US economy or the European economy or whatever, it's going to happen. It's going to happen beyond your control. But in the final analysis, it's all about the global economy, which is critical. What's happening in Asia, what's happening in Africa, what's happening in Europe and the US, you have to be prepared for what's going on. And at the same time, getting back to the focus, you need to realize that you've got to think locally. Because if you're going to expand your business into some of these regions, you have to know what's going on in those regions. In fact, just the other night, we had a call with the royal challengers of Bangalore in the IPL, Indian Premier League cricket. And cricket is one of the sports that we cover. It's a great sport. It's not one that I know very well, but it's a huge following. And IPL has got a great following. And I guess the royal challengers have a great following as well. And we're talking to them about how we integrate our service worth theirs. And one guy very astutely on the call says, well, I looked at your app and it's all, you know, it's kind of focused on US sports. And you have US service providers and all this stuff. And we're like, yep, yep, we admit it. We're guilty. But the focus part of our business is we don't even know where to begin when it comes to India. But the global thinking globally and thinking big part says we need to be involved with cricket. We need to be involved with rugby. And we need to be involved with international football, the real football. And if we're going to get into India, if we're going to get into China, into Japan, Korea, Germany, whatever, we need to have partners there who help us out because it's a very complex landscape. But we have to be thinking about heading into that direction because that's an important part of our future. And so we're laying the seeds now for our ability to execute on the international landscape. And hopefully the royal challenges will take us up on their offer and help us into India. And hopefully we'll get a call from Byron Munich to get ourselves into Germany. And from an EPL team to get us into Britain, we'll see how these things play out. But we have to have some patience. So finally I'm at FUS. As I mentioned, the idea came a couple of years ago. We really started full time, put everything else aside a year ago. And there are some tensions, as I've already mentioned, that we're addressing. And I'll just, I'll give you a few extra ones that as kind of a bonus and then wrap up and go to Q&A. One of the first things we had to do was compensate people for the work even when we were working part-time. And that brought up cash versus equity. And all of us at first were on equity. But what we did was something that I'll throw out to you as a proposal. Because I'm not sure how often this has been done. But we created an economy in our company where cash and equity were fungible. And basically when we raised seed money for our company, we priced the round. And we basically said, you know, it's whatever. Ten cents per share for this. And when individuals invested in our company, they invested at ten cents per share. And when somebody did work for us, we simply could convert that either a dollar amount or a share amount. And it just didn't matter to us. Because some of the folks that were working part-time for our company needed cash and some of the folks that were working for our company wanted equity. And we wanted to accommodate both without creating attention. So we created this economy within the company. It forced us to price our seed round. And it's very popular these days to do a convertible. And I won't get into all the details. But to basically bring money in that would convert into a round that would be priced later. And we decided not to do that so we could create this economy. And I'll just throw out that this experiment, I believe, worked very well. Because those of us who wanted equity, we were all in for equity and those who wanted cash, no problem. And you could take out cash and get equity. You could put in cash. But you could take out cash. Well, anyway, anyway, you could go back and forth. But this was a very interesting decision that we made for fundraising. Number two, from Thus. Valuation. How do you set a valuation for your company when there's not much there? And of course, that's an art rather than a science. But the point that I'm going to just push out here in the next minute is it's very attractive to have a high valuation, evaluate your company at something that you can go and boast about or at least internally feel like, hey, we got this high valuation. We actually set out to get the lowest valuation we could. That's not exactly correct because we didn't want to just give away the company. But we, and this is going to really sound aware perhaps, we really want to make our investors money. And as a consequence, we don't want to raise money at a super high valuation. We want to make sure that the valuation that we set on our company is low enough so that we give our investors the maximum chance of making money in the venture. Which of course, we want to give ourselves the maximum chance of making money in the venture. And if you want to raise a subsequent round of financing and your prior round is priced too high, it becomes more difficult. So we strove to raise as little money as we could at as low a valuation as we could. And we're now just, just now going out for our first institution round of financing and it seems to be playing out well. Because we're not getting pushback in terms of where our prior round valuation was. So something to think about. You can brag a lot about high valuations, but they, you want the right valuation. You got a balanced delusion, you got to balance getting your next round. And finally, well, I guess the final point I've already brought up is, do you care or not care about your investors? Do you care or not care about your venture capitalists? And this is, I guess it's an obvious one coming from somebody who's formerly a venture capitalist. But I have seen, on many occasions, an entrepreneur very, very thankful for the money that comes in from their venture capital backers. But then forgetting the fact that the venture capitalists has their own goals and desires in terms of making money and making money facts. And it's something to think about. They're a stakeholder. Your employees are stakeholders. Your customers, your partners, they're all stakeholders. You've got to balance all these things in incredible uncertainty. And it's very difficult to do. But it's, I guess I'll, I'll implore you that as you build your business forward, don't lose sight of any of these stakeholders and take on the challenge of balancing all these different uncertainties. There are no answers, but ultimately you'll make really good decisions because you'll be able to justify them based on how your decisions impact all the different stakeholders. Not easy, but I think a lot of you are going into entrepreneurship and you'll realize that in the final analysis, you are living in uncertainty and you're just going to have to deal with it. So that's the story as I run it down and I'd be very happy to take questions on any element of the stock. Thank you. For me, the name of your company, too, is an amazing sound. Is it a initial of your founder or what is it? Oh, so Thus, which is spelled, T-H, oh, with question. Where does Thus come from and what is the name derived from? So Thus, which is spelled, T-H-U-Z, and I'll have to explain that in this. Actually, that's really easy to explain. The URL is available. Believe it or not. Five letters long and you can kind of look at it fanatically, kind of. It basically is short for enthusiasm or enthusiast. In fact, when we were thinking about the company, we were saying to ourselves, there are sports fanatics out there and the sports fanatics are already watching. If they're 49ers fanatics, you're going to be watching the 49ers. We're not going to tell you anything new, but it's the enthusiast. It's the person that loves a great game, but isn't necessarily always tuned in. That's the person we're appealing to. It's kind of like the 95% that we're appealing to. So it's all about enthusiasm. So you dabbled in entrepreneurship and then you went off and you were a VC for more than a decade where you dealt with a lot of entrepreneurs. And now you've found an unusual thing, which is going back and being an entrepreneur. And I want you to say, back, because this is really over. Big venture is an entrepreneur. Have there been any really big surprises to you after being around entrepreneurs for so long? Have there been some big surprises now that you're actually in the driver's seat? Yes. So the question was, are there big surprises now that I'm entrepreneur rather than an venture capitalist? And I guess in a way I was prepared for surprise because again, uncertainty surprise, et cetera. And in fact, I guess I'll make a couple points here. There are a couple of absolute, and then I'll answer your question. Hopefully. There are a couple of absolute notions. So I just talked a lot about uncertainty, but I think there are some absolute here and things I wasn't surprised about. The number one thing is it's really hard work. And there's no letting up. There's nothing, you know, as a venture capitalist, there are so many things to do and there's so many ways you can add value to a company. You can't possibly do it all. So therefore, you just pick and choose and it's actually comforting to know that you can't do everything and your companies are still managed and they'll go forward whether you help or not and you help that you help as much as you can. As an entrepreneur, your company is moving forward only in so far as you're doing something and it is really hard work. And so that's obviously, that's an absolute. Another absolute is prioritization. There's too little time, you've got to prioritize, you've got to be absolutely brutal and prioritizing. And another absolute is passion. And this is the thing that I think I'm most surprised about is how passionate I am about what I'm doing right now. And it's not that I wasn't passionate about the portfolio companies that I was backing. I love these companies, but they weren't my own. I mean, they were, you know, I had a part of them and I love them in their own way. But what I'm doing now is just it's really, it's part of me and I'm overjoyed. The folks that have come and joined our venture, I'm tickled that they've joined this venture because they've joined this passion and it's really cool when they take it on and I can let them fly and, you know, I hear them talk about it. It's really great. And so the buzz that you get as an entrepreneur is phenomenal. And of course, the highs and the lows are huge, the swings. And you know, I have to be honest, when you're first starting out a company, even, you know, we've been at it again for a year or two depending on how you count. There haven't been too many lows. We'll brace for them. I'm sure something will happen. And I would say that these early days are great because you're just clicking along. You know, if you're growing from 1000 users to 10,000 to 100,000, you can do it. You know, somewhere the tension comes into play where things go wrong. You lose a partner. Something, your service goes down at the worst possible moment, whatever. And you'll hit those lows and those lows will be super low. We don't have a portfolio as an entrepreneur. You don't have, you know, as a VC, if one of my companies was doing poorly and other companies was doing great, that was always the case. And so you can balance that out. The other thing that's interesting, again, I'm being very candid and open. The moment that we took in money and started this business full time, I started dreaming. And I don't mean like I'm dreaming of how, you know, I mean, like I started remembering my dreams. I go to sleep, I wake up in the morning, I said, I had a dream. I haven't remembered the first time I had it, you know, that I remember, I'm sorry. I don't remember the last time I remembered a dream. And I was just thinking to myself, my brain's actually working differently now. My brain was working constantly. I guess I was able to kind of compartmentalize things or shut things down as a venture capitalist. But or maybe there was too much to think about because there were 10 companies that I was thinking about. Here there's one company and it's like, you know, again, this guy's going to sell his house and I've got this deliverable and I've got, you know, it's more stressful. There's no doubt about that. But it's fun stressful. It's kind of ex-game stressful. You know, we're on the half pipe and it's cool. So there's a couple of nuances there. Yes. You talk about being very passionate and then I know you have a lot of different school experiences. Were there any course or major that really helps spark any of this passion that you have now? So the question is, are there any courses or other experiences that help to spark and promote this passion? That's a really interesting question and it's interesting because I'm so far removed, if you will, from my undergraduate years, to think specifically about the impact that I, you know, it's interesting. I guess in telling the story, everything has had an impact on where I am today and there's a bad answer. So I'll try to get a better answer in just a moment. And there's so much luck and chance and uncertainty. Again, that led, you know, I'd never planned on starting a company. It just kind of happened to me. And in fact, as I mentioned, when we started the company, we were all part-time and we didn't know is this company going to be real or is it not? How big could it be, is adventure fundable or is it not? And you almost have to be stoic and just go with it. It kind of carries you along. But specific classes or courses are interesting. You know, I think one thing I look back on is my dad loves sports and he would, you know, he'd forced me to watch the Bears and the Bulls and the Black Oaks and University of Michigan and his alma mater. And you know, I guess, you know, that was important. Everything really is. I guess I'm not going to come up with a great answer for you. I mean, really, I mean, there's a lot of classes. Oh, here, one example. This is going to be really out of left field. Obviously, a lot of classes are terrific. One class that was so surprisingly interesting was my accounting class in business school. You go into accounting, you think, okay, you've got debits and credits, you've got a balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, whatever. It just is what it is. You plug it into Microsoft Excel. Well, the professor of this class took a completely different tack on accounting. And it was all about the subjectivity of accounting, the way to look at numbers in different ways to inform or even mislead. And so we spent the entire quarter looking through balance sheets and income statements and annual reports of companies and determining who's hiding what. And where were they hiding it? And then understanding at the end of the day that these things we thought are absolute like numbers and, you know, there's cash and are not absolute whatsoever. So I guess it's a good answer given that I just talked about uncertainty. But it just showed how intuitive business is, how interpretive business is. And if Fortune 500 companies, if general electric can be interpretive with its annual report, think of how interpretive you can be with a startup company. That was a very cool class. And again, not to discredit any other class, it's very interesting. One more question. Okay, one more question. Who gets to be the final question? Yes. I mean, they're related. I am interested if you think that passion is a real interest in the business that you want to start can make you myopic at all. And if you went back to your undergraduate cohort because they were all at the either somewhere between the enthusiasts to passionate about sports, and do you seek to find people who really don't share an interest in sports so they can kind of ground you in some other way? That's a great question. So the question was, can your passion blind you to where you should go? Do you seek out others who are not as passionate perhaps to help round out the team? And this gets back to my point about diversity. I mean, there's so many different axes of diversity. And actually one of them is the axes of dispassionate about sports. And I would say I would absolutely want the folks to be passionate about foods. But the Dan, my third co-founder, is dispassionate about sports. Yeah, he was act Pandora for many years. He loves music. And he went from music to sports. He went from a passion of his to whatever. And I thought kind of in my mind, this is really cool. Now I also thought in my mind, ooh, is this going to work out? But I really did think that this would be really cool because I wanted somebody who would look at our business and not get caught up in the hype. And not get caught up in the emotion. And so it was great to have one of the three initial founders have this kind of dispassion. And he's our user experience guy. So he's always about, how do we make this easy and intuitive, logical, beautiful, whatever. And he doesn't get caught up in, hey, Stanford's got to be color cardinal and North Carolina, baby blue or else. He's like, no, no, it's got to be simple, it's got to be, you know, and I think it's wonderful. And again, along all sorts of dimensions, we need to get people thinking differently. And one of the, so one of these days I'm going to have to actually manage somebody. I mean, I've hired in people who are incredibly capable and it scares me to death that I'm actually going to have to manage. VCs don't manage for sure. And as an entrepreneur, as a CEO, I'm going to be called to task at some point in time. But right now, it's wonderful having these people just be able to go off, do their thing. And because they're all different, they're going to be able to come together, provide perspective, reach consensus, and then go off and do their thing again. But we need that, yeah, we need people who are not quite as passionate. And it's a great question. So thank you. You worked.
