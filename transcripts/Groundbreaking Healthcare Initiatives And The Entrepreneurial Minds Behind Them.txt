 You are listening to the Draper Fisher-Jurvinson entrepreneurial thought-leader seminar, brought to you weekly by Stanford Technology Ventures program at Stanford University School of Engineering. I'd like to introduce our guest speaker for today, Ryan Phalan. Ryan is a serial entrepreneur in the whole area of health, consumer health, and I would say also living things, looking at some of the other ventures that Ryan has co-founded. She's here today as a co-founder of DNA Direct, but she started out with Plain Tree back in 1978. And she's going to tell you a little bit about some of those ventures. You could see through her bio that there have been other interesting ventures along the way. One that I'd love to hear her talk a little bit about, and I'll ask a question about it if we don't cover it in the main presentation, is the All Species Foundation. So this idea of discovering all the species on the planet. Ryan, we're delighted that you're here with us today, and can't wait to hear what you have to say. Welcome, Ryan Phalan. Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here this afternoon. I did a little bit of homework before coming here. I must say it was a bit stressful. I listened to a number of the podcasts of earlier speakers, and I thought, how could I possibly add to their articulate words of wisdom and their incredible experience? And I thought of one area. And that area is around really the just a position of nonprofits and for-profit businesses, and the whole concept of running a business as a service, and running services as a business. And so what I'd like to do today is actually give you my personal story of serial entrepreneurship. I'm going to have you walk through 30 years of my career together. It was also a challenge going back through my archives, finding things I actually kept and things I didn't keep, and finding out the number of things I could Google, and the things that I can't Google because they were just two damn long ago. So as I go through this presentation, I'd like you to think with me what's changed over the 30 years in these industries that I'm going to reflect on, and what hasn't changed? And how would you do some of the businesses or services that I started? How would you do them today, or would you do them today at all? And if you did what tools, what resources would you bring to that task? But one area also where I think I differ on, with some of your previous speakers, and that is that everything I've started has been done on a, probably on a real shoe string. Some were for-profit ventures that were started with, with angel investment money, but none of the businesses that I've started ever took in more than 5 million in total equity. And I've changed that with the current business, I should add, but currently that's my number. And many of the nonprofits that I ran were really done on very small budgets and yet had, I think, tremendous impact in a number of areas. So let me start. Okay, we're going to start, I think this will work. We're going to start with the Whole Earth catalog, which was 30 years ago, I was really probably your age. I was 23 at the time. The Whole Earth catalog was really sort of the Bible of my generation. It was the web before the web. It had incredible access to tools, and probably many of your parents grew up in some of them were even influenced by it. And what, when I was in college, one of the things that, and I was at University of Berkeley, one of the things that I realized was that there was this incredible surplus of, not a surplus, but an incredible number of nonprofit services for the community members and very little access to that. It was impossible for women to get access to daycare centers or social services like mental health care or a plan parenthood. There was a lot of money going into these areas and the nonprofit and very little access. So one of the things that I wanted to do was to do my own book, and I just graduated, and I thought, how could I do that? Publishing was not like it is today, and it was traditional print. You had to find a publisher and things like that. But I looked in the very back of the Whole Earth catalog, and on the very last page of it was an article about how to do a Whole Earth catalog. And what it really talked about was the innovative technology then, which was an IBM Selectric typewriter, and the big deal on the right there were type font balls, which really allowed a user, and it was really a professional user, but a user to actually change the look and feel of a written page. Well, that was pretty fundamental. It's really how the Whole Earth catalog was done. It was how it was done as a really a pioneering venture. And so I thought, well, I could translate that, and I thought I would create a book called Savvy. And I published that book in 1976, and it was originally funded by a grant from a private foundation. I had a lot of promises from the University of Berkeley and the City of Berkeley to actually help publish it, actually not publish it, but actually help distribute it. It was something that I wanted to give away to all residents of Berkeley, and it included everything from mental health care and physical health care and employment and job training. But at the end of the day, we actually had to turn it into a small business. My partner, Annie Phillips and I, actually, you know, big deal watching that book go through a printing press, and I was amused at looking at these old photos. So just how different that is today when I think of how anyone today would actually put out a blog or put out a wiki or any number of ways of distributing that same information, how revolutionary that has been. Well, with that, after I did that, I realized I thought I wanted to be a publisher, and I thought, well, I was going to leverage this incredible business experience I had of grassroots and tools. And I wanted to go and become a publisher, and I asked people, well, how do you get started in this business? I want to do it all. I don't want to just go be a graphic designer or an editor. And they said, well, there's only probably one place in the whole area you could go work. And that would be like for Stuart Brand of the whole Earth catalog. I mean, they do it all. So I called Stuart Brand, and I ended up working at the whole Earth catalog for a year. I should add, because it might come up, I later married Stuart, but it was a good year there. I learned a hell of a lot. And I got a little bit interested in healthcare was that when I was there, the whole Earth catalog, again pioneered in self-care. And it was really at the very forefront of helping people think about alternative medicine in different ways, as that book title is, take care of yourself. So with that, I met a woman here locally in San Francisco named Angie Tyrion, and she had a vision of trying to help change the healthcare system. Now, I was perfectly healthy, never had a medical problem, but I thought it was a big enough idea that it warranted my interest. And Angie's vision was actually to change the way hospitals are run. She actually wanted to build her own hospital that would actually be a healing environment. It would be a place that if you were sick today or someone in your family, you'd want to go to. And the vision for it was grand. It would have complementary medicine. It would have its own kitchens for patients and families to cook on the unit. It would have people wearing normal pajamas, or instead of being disrobed, the minute that they get into a hospital, it would have access to medical information at the bedside. And it would really create a parody between nurses and physicians and incorporate the family as part of, as we referred to it as a team member of the healthcare process. Well, one of the things that I realized from my experience was that information was everything. That if you wanted to empower the patient, you had to start by not just changing their physical environment, but you had to start by giving them access to medical information. Because at the end of the day, if you really were going to be an active participant in your healthcare, it really started by understanding why you were in the hospital and that what you were going to do when you actually went home. So the first part of plain tree, in which we started in 1978, was to create a medical library for consumers. And it was the very first medical library for consumers. It was located and still is on the corner of Sacramento and Webster at California Pacific Medical Center. I raised the funds to actually renovate that ground floor. And we turned it into a model for other medical centers to look at. We did a book called How to Start a People's Medical Library. And in that library were hundreds of titles. We set it up in such a way that it was very user friendly. So a woman who's coming in and learning about pregnancy was also looking at early childhood development. They were looking at prenatal care at all different levels. Likewise, people who were looking at information on cancer, especially really life-threatening cancer, they may have also had access to information on hospice care. And this is the first time, I mean hospice was something that patients didn't even know about at the time. Alternative birth centers, by the way, had not even been conceived before. So this medical library taught me a lot because it was a physical way of seeing how people use medical information. And now that I've done a number of businesses that are all electronic, I can tell you how incredibly powerful it is to actually do things face to face with people, and to see what works and what doesn't, and how important information is. So with this medical library, we had access to all kinds of services as well, and really tried to help people think through this aspect of their life. The model hospital project went on to create an inpatient 16-bed medical surgical unit at California Pacific Medical Center. It really changed people's lives in the hospital. It was absolutely revolutionary. By 1980, AIDS hit San Francisco. Many of our beds were taken up by AIDS patients that really had such a profound experience on that unit. I remember many of them who many of them died there in those early days. And the family members could actually be part of that care. That was, it had never happened before at that level. So during that time that I was doing planetary, I was running as the executive director. It was about a 10-year span. We had a very active board of directors. We raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the library, millions of dollars for these different projects, including grants to actually analyze the return on investment for the hospitals. And we ended up opening other medical surgical units as well as acute and non-acute care settings. But one of the things I realized after 10 years of doing this nonprofit work of real service work, I realized I wanted to understand how do you fund something? How do you make ideas and organizations last? How do you give them staying power so that we were not constantly on the dole trying to look for the next grant? And I thought, you know, I want to be a business woman. I want to make something pay for itself. So I took a sabbatical from the nonprofit sector and thought long and hard about it. And the things that were interesting me and the times were, I would say, innovators in very different fields. And one of them was Ivan Schuernart at Patagonia. And Patagonia's catalog had just gotten off the ground. And he was changing the whole sporting industry. I mean, people were doing skiing in a very different way before Patagonia. He really gave people access to incredible tools and incredible new technologies for their sports. And Ivan also has always been, I think, a real role model of how to do a business as a service with a significant amount of their profits going to the nonprofit sector. Smith and Hawking was another catalog that had just started. Paul Hawking was an early advisor also to my company. And really a business mentor for me. Smith and Hawking today is not anything close to what the original catalog was like. Paul sold it very early on. And it really was innovating in the gardening field. I mean, it was really talking about bringing in quality tools. And he was really prescient in understanding that gardening was going to be a way to do it. It was going to be a way that ran across all ages in our culture and all different income levels. And it would be a very fundamental part of everyday life here in America. And he wrote a book called Growing a Business that had a profound impact on me. And many of these things that I've learned and thought about, about how do you again add value to your customer beyond the sales transaction. Not just the customer, how do you actually add value to that whole community of users. This was pioneering work back in 1987. And Paul gave me some very good advice. I had an idea that I went to him with and I said, you know, I want to do clothing and gear for the adventurous woman. I had just come back from Africa and I thought, you know, my God, you know, there's so much that women should be doing today. And they don't because the whole sporting industry has been geared towards males. And Paul said, well, you know, Ryan, that's a really good idea. But why don't you just start instead of all sporting goods and all adventurous stuff for women. Why don't you start with something that you are good at and that you alone are really passionate about. And so at the time, I had just taken up the equestrian sports. It was a very stayed field. And in those days, basically, you know, people were very divided in different camps between western writers and English writers and never the two should mix. There were Hunseat writers and Dr. Sajwriters. There were barrel racers and there were, you know, race horse jockeys. And nobody, these were different leagues. They wrote different types of horses, different breeds. And they lived in different stables in different universes. And I thought, okay, well, how am I going to innovate in this field? And what can I really do? And I had visions of, oh, my God, I'll travel all over the world. And I'll find the cool things from Argentina and look at what the Gautos wear and I'll bring in import saddles from Argentina. And you know, my vision was much bigger than my abilities in those days. And Paul said, well, just do one thing well. Just start with a brochure and see if you can actually resonate this idea with anybody. And I was living on the east coast at that time. My husband was teaching at MIT at the Media Lab in those very early days. And, excuse me. And I started throwing this idea around people on the east coast about wanting to innovate in the inquestering field. And I cannot tell you how many people said, basically, well, that's a really nice idea. Why would you do that? Or, you know, if that was, those were the good comments, the really hard comments where why in the world would anyone want to do that? And I would come back to the west coast and I would meet with people who would say, go for it. And I really, really, there really is this divide and that you guys are growing up and living in an area right now, which is so entrepreneurial. And I'm sure that's changed somewhat. But I do think we have a real privilege here and encouraging entrepreneurship that is not seen certainly across the nation equally. So with my experience on the east coast, I did temper my enthusiasm and I thought long and hard about taking in family and friends money. And I ended up starting this company. I got early feedback from consumers that, yes, I might have been on to something with innovating in a writing gene that was totally designed for writing as opposed to a sport gene. And in 1987 with Angel funding, I actually launched my first catalog. And it really was fun. Those were great years. It ran for five years. We did very innovative things. I became a designer, a manufacturer. I met great people in the field names that you would know, Susie Tomkins, who started a spree. People here that were really local that were just tremendous resources and advisors to me. And I did travel all over. We did fashion shoots with local writers, real writers. We crossed the chasm between different styles. And more importantly, I think what we did as we grew the catalog was as we blended these different parts of the sport with a common passion around writing. We actually really did change in a lot of ways the way people interacted in this field. But I crossed an interesting boundary, which is that I also went into fashion. And when I sold the company for a song in 1992, one of the things that happened before I sold it in 1992, when I went to raise capital for it, we were doing three million in sales. The company was just starting to reach profitability because it had scaled slowly and built up an incredible asset base of patents and things like that with our manufacturing. But we crossed into the fashion world. And when I went to raise capital, investors looked at it and said, well, we don't do a question. We do fashion. And if they were doing anything in the fashion world, they said, well, we don't do sport. And because I was blending these worlds, it became a complicated sale. In 1992, the retail recession hit here. And we went from a vibrant, whatever it was, maybe a 5,000 square foot warehouse filled with assets and inventory to closing it in 1993. And I share this with you because that's me there in the very back cleaning and brushing the floor. There was a lot of stuff that was very glamorous about starting a business. And there's stuff that's really brutal about cleaning up the pieces when they don't work. At the end of the day, your employees are gone, your investors have come and gone. And it's really you at the helm who's got to see it all the way through. But what I can say is that that was an incredibly learning experience for me. I really learned how to see something through to make sure that the vendors that I worked with did really well that the customers at the end of the day got what they needed. And I really stood by and helped all of our employees as best I could find gainful employment at a time when it wasn't so easy in 1992. And I think doing that right served me well, a number of people that invested in feelings, equestrian catalog, ended up coming forward in future ventures that I was involved in. And many of them said that the reason that they came forward was because of the experience that I went through and the way that I handled adversary, at adverse, at mercy. So in 1993, I closed up shop, it was a tough time. And I thought, well, will I ever find a way to start another business? And then I saw Mosaic and I saw Netscape. And those were the first web browsers. And I thought when I saw them, oh my god, if I had just stayed in business one more year, I would have had a business on the web and everything would have changed. And maybe in a good way, maybe in the best possible way, that transition was a good thing for me because the truth be told, I wasn't really passionate about that field of the, you know, other than I loved horses. I didn't love being a catalog owner, operator, provider, all of that started to become pretty routine. But what I wanted to do was that experience of trying to find a way to make something profitable. And when I saw them, my first web browser, I thought really not so much about what it was going to do to online catalog sales, what I really thought is how transformative it could be for healthcare. And by the way, through this whole time while I was doing this catalog company, I had stayed on the Plain Tree Board of Directors, had often been chairman of the board and really always kept my hands in the healthcare field. So I had a big vision, then it was, and this is an old slide, it was, to become a source for all health and medical information. And I looked at all and I thought, oh my god, I thought even then, you know, that was possible. We wanted to be on online source for every kind of resource around patient education and medical information. And there wasn't really a model for that on the web. I mean, you know, nobody knew how anybody was going to make money on the web in 1994, 1995. And what I thought was if I could find a way to build this library and if I did it in enough of a quality way, I would find a way to sell it into the healthcare system. So I created direct medical knowledge and it was the first online medical library. It was, we sold, I should mention right now, it was a full medical reference library with, I secured, I think, something close to 200 publishing contracts with different medical and healthcare publishers. And by the way, this was the first time anyone had been licensing content to put up on the web. The idea was just, you know, so outside the scope of most, most publishers at that time. We licensed a World Book Medical Encyclopedia and Drug Information. And we really created, at the end of the day, our big value was to create a personalized report for people around different medical topics. We sold the service to manage care, manage care clients, Blue Cross Blue Shield and Eumannah were number one clients. And that was our model. By 1999, we were one of the, or actually probably 1997, we were one of the first companies, albeit small, but we actually had a functional business model, manage care clients, paid us an upfront set up fee of 250,000 to actually build out that medical library. So, we had a lot of client members had access to the site, not a new idea today, mind you, but very revolutionary then. And then we did a licensing agreement with them on a per-member, per-month basis to access this gated site. But as things happen in 1999, I got the spotlight of WebMD. And they were just curing up. They had just done a merger with Healthion, they're combined companies. In 1999, we're valued at $5.5 billion. We got that merger, we were acquired, we were their first medical library acquisition, and we got bundled into that roll-up, our less than 5 million equity that had come into the company, returned 65 million to those investors. That was the great news. The bad news was I loved what I was doing. I had done it because I was really passionate about this field, and I wanted to innovate. I was just beginning to work with my software team of engineers. And that was just a really cool time to be in business and growing a company. But WebMD came along, and it was an offer that we couldn't review, refuse. They acquired the company, I went off again and went on sabbatical, and during that time thought long and hard about what my next enterprise should be. And at that time, if you look back at the year of 2000, at the height of the .com period, or then starting to be the crash, there were a lot of new millionaires involved. And not yet a lot of philanthropy happening, but myself and a number of different people that I know well decided around a dinner table, what would be one of the big ideas that if there was a new level of philanthropy could actually change the world. And we had all different kinds of ideas, but Kevin Kelly at the time said, well, you know, wouldn't it be radical if we actually knew all life on earth? I mean, if we actually understood more than a fraction of the species that we're here, wouldn't it help us take better care of the planet, wouldn't it help us identify invasive species, wouldn't it help us understand better therapeutic approaches that we can take towards different plants and botanicals, and the list goes on and on. And the more that we looked into it, we found out, well, according to different estimates, we know less than 5, 10% of the total amount of life on earth. We know such a fraction. We know one point now, 1.7 million species, then it was 1.2 million. And taxonomy was being done in a very old fashioned way. So we put out kind of a manifesto, a call to inventory of all life on earth. I sponsored the first conference before we even had an organization. I funded it at the California Academy of Science and we flew in from all over the world about 60 different scientists, all with different expertise. And we said, well, what would it take to actually, you know, try to accelerate the discovery of life? And one thing led to another, we created, we got a lot of people involved in this, this is a Wall Street Journal piece. It got a lot of interest from scientists as well as people in the life sciences community, in the museum community that handle all of these specimens. And with that, we raised a million dollars and we were moving towards funding what we were trying to refer to then as the encyclopedia of life. E.O. Wilson, many of you may know, is one of the most famous naturalists and scientists at Harvard. Really was a very active member. And he helped us think through what would an encyclopedia of life be like if you could actually go to the web and look up everything about a species. So with our group of software engineers, we created a search engine and we crawled many of these closed databases to see what we could come up with. And in 2002, we were up to about 873,000 species. It was pretty much kept behind firewalls of these gated museums and collections under their databases. And we tried to envision what a search engine page would look like. And this was a mockup it never came to be. But the idea would be that you would actually type in a species name and you would be able to find synonyms, you would be able to find general information, you could find images, you could all find information. And all these things, unlike what Google searches today, it would be much richer and much more in context and you could find genetic information and everything else about that. Well, I'm glad to say that that was 2002 and I know firsthand that a number of search engine companies today are actually looking very much at exactly this kind of model of a very narrow vertical search. But in 2002, a lot of people weren't paying attention to all species as a foundation. We didn't raise more than 1 million and we really needed to raise a lot more. But what I was seeing as I was at CEO of this nonprofit was the incredible impact that genetic information was going to have on species identification. And there was a movement of foot that was called the barcode initiative, which is now really taking off. And that is to actually take a very, very small part of the mitochondrial DNA at the species level and be able to use it almost as a barcode to identify species out in the field. And I'm not going to go into much more detail about it, but as I was looking at the power of genetics, I realized that I was also learning more and more about how it was if genetics was affecting and would affect human health. And I thought, well, I wonder if now in 2002, 2004, I guess I was up to, is it time to actually try to help the consumer learn more about their own genetic information? And at the time, there was always something in the press coming forward and we see it every day today about the future of genetics is here now, know your DNA about diet and genes, about how genes influence family, history, and family health. And I thought I would really take a look at where the growth in this whole field of molecular diagnostics was going. And in 2004, according to these statistics, it was molecular diagnostics was going to be a $6 billion interest industry and it was forecasted to be a $32 billion industry in 2013. And in fact, this is exactly playing out. The biggest growth area for this is in predictive testing for predisposition towards a health or family medical problem and into the area of what is referred to as pharmacogenetics around drug metabolism and genotyping. And I looked at what some of the bottlenecks were and why hasn't this technology, if there's so much interest in the media, why hasn't genetics been incorporated in your health care today on a daily basis. And here is some of the drivers that are moving this field. For every 300,000 patients today, there's only one medical genetic system in the country. Some states have a very little genetic expertise and others obviously in major metropolitan areas have more. But the same thing with genetic counselors and genetic counselors are a form of professionals who actually help people think through the impact of their genetic information. There's very limited access to these genetic experts. There's lots of labs that can actually do molecular diagnostics today. It's one of the fastest growing fields. There's very little awareness in the medical community today around how health and genes combined and how people can incorporate testing information. And as what I have learned more and more about health care, it's very slow to adopt new technology. There's also very limited insurance coverage for a lot of genetic testing. And of course, there's a fear of genetic discrimination. So I thought about these problems in the marketplace and I thought about the promise of this technology. And I looked at, well, what happens when somebody gets a genetic test result? So this is actually an example here on the screen of what a patient would get if they took a test to find out if they had a predisposition to breast cancer. And it's very hard to read, not just because of my slide, but because it's very technical and even health care professionals have a hard time interpreting it and really trying to make sense for the patient. What does it mean if you're carrying this gene? What does it mean to your siblings? What is your risk of getting breast cancer? What is your risk of getting ovarian cancer? And so I thought, well, is there a way to do a much better job providing this information? Could I parlay what I learned at direct medical knowledge in providing personalized reports and creating a medical library online? Could I use that kind of technology? Could I use that kind of thinking? Could I use all those years of watching patients actually walk into a medical library and try to make a difference? So with that, in 1994, I set out and raised money from some happy investors who were in my former investment in direct medical knowledge. And I convinced them that a mission to help bring the power of personalized medicine to every patient and consumer and to health care providers could actually reduce health risk, it could help prevent disease. And in many cases, it could actually better target a therapy based on drug metabolism. So in 1995, just last year, in January of last year, we launched this website. And at DNA Direct actually now offers genetic testing direct to the consumer. We've had a year of working directly with the public. We provide in-depth education on the site in our content library around inherited medical problems and conditions. We help facilitate the collection of DNA. We are not the lab. We don't do the lab. We test. We actually send out contract with labs all over the country. Most people do DNA testing through our site by a buckle swab. It's just a cheek swab that somebody takes a little scraping of DNA from the inside of their cheek. Some of our tests are done with a blood specimen and we contract with lab core who actually facilitates all of our testing. And people can go to a lab draw site in any major city and provide that specimen if they need. We provide these personalized reports online. And we've basically web-enabled genetic counseling. Because remember, when I showed you that picture of the bottleneck, there's a limited number of them. And this is a way of giving people much greater access to genetic testing. So we do these reports. If someone was to print out one of these reports online, it would probably be 30 to 50 pages. But of course on the web, people browse and they look at what they want. The first day they come in when they get their test results, they're focused on chapter one, what your results mean. A week later they come back and they say, okay, what does this mean to my family members? And how do I share this with my family if I'm going to be at increased risk for this or that very serious medical problem? And how do I share this with physicians and the healthcare team? So we also provide information to their physicians and help them with it and provide phone counseling as needed. Our current tests include everything from common forms of blood clotting disorder called thrombophilia to carrier testing for cystic fibrosis. We help people look at underlying causes of infertility based on a genetic factor. We look at genetic causes for recurrent pregnancy loss. All of these things are areas where genetic testing can actually help people change something that they're doing in their life, change their apute or make informed healthcare decisions. And as we go forward, we're really looking at this whole field of drug metabolism and we'll be launching tests around areas like tomoxifen and very specific antidepressants and how they're linked to genotype. I think our strategy to do this is to really basically to build a destination site for genetics and personalized medicine. And what we really want to do is distribute our services not only to consumers online but also through healthcare providers, through labs and managed care organizations. And so as I look at this business and as I reflect on all this time, no doubt there are lots of challenges in running a company like this. Not everyone wants to know about their genetics. I mean, for many of you here it might be like, who cares? But if there was a very cheap and affordable test that really gave you your blueprint, your DNA blueprint, that would be great. But we don't have it today. There's no $1,000 all genome test. And the truth is, genetic testing really needs to be interpreted. It's just not going to be a one-pager that you get printed out at home. It's got to be a lot more informative to make it really actionable. It's not an inexpensive. Many of our tests run from anywhere from $300 to $3,000. And again, many people are only going to be comfortable ordering tests like this through their physician. So I see in an area like that a tremendous opportunity. Only a fraction of the population is ever utilized as kind of testing less than 1%. There's an exponentially growing number of tests in the marketplace. Already there's some 1,200 genetic tests that are available. And what I know is that in the near future, every one of you in this room at some point in your life are going to have a genetic test for one reason or another or want one. And so what we're really trying to do is position our company in a way that we could be that provider online. So now I want to come full circle and say, that's where I am today. What did I learn and what do I think about when I contrast these two industries between the publishing world that I've been bearing relationship to and to health care? I look back at that old photo of us sitting around and looking at a printing press. And I think of the tools that you guys have at your hand today from your ability to do podcasts, to do blogs, to do video. And all of this information, your ability to publish is so different and that field has moved in such a radical way. And then I look and I think about health care. And I want to just comment on something that just was a surprise to me and should have been. And this last month on one of the cover stories on strategy and business publication, I believe that of MIT was an article on five star hospitals and it featured plain tree. And this was news. And I'm glad to see it in the news. My God finally, this is really this nonprofit that I started is really grown into supplement. There's something like 90 plain tree hospitals nationwide. They've got international alliances with hospitals that are trying to think and think differently about taking care of patients. And as you see here, treating patients like customers, not only good business, good medicine, it's good business. So we're back to this whole idea of businesses service and services business. Again, you know, what they're commenting the article is how radical it is for patients and families to be able to cook in a hospital and eat something other than institutional food. They're talking about the fact that patients could have access to medical records. And in fact, where they did a study, patients having access to their medical records actually lowered malpractice claims. We made that case in 1978 when we were talking to hospital administrators at wire patients, litigious because they're kept in the dark and they're surprised. If they're part of the team, you know, something goes wrong. Well, you know, that was their choice. They were part of it. It's a very different relationship. Again, today in 2006, this is new news in the healthcare field. So I look at that field and I say, okay, healthcare, it's slow to adopt these technologies. There's still no common electronic medical record. When we just had the devastating hurricanes and tsunamis, people's medical records were never in a place that they could go and pull that information from one city to the next, from one country to the next. It's not portable. There's very little interoperability of data. The patient does not come first in healthcare by and large. It's most technology. Most services are geared around the efficiency of the medical staff and the medical administration. And the truth is many doctors are still very informed by or so bothered by informed patients coming in with information they got off of WebMD. So I look at that and I say, my God, there's a tremendous opportunity here. Eight out of 10 Web users use the Web to seek out health information. Nine million users a day are searching for medical information. That's more than people see a doctor or go to a doctor on a daily basis. $40 billion is annually spent out of pocket for complimentary medicine. And when I started again in this field, people were saying, well, who's going to pay for complimentary medicine? It's not going to be paid for by insurance. Well, in fact, people pay out of pocket for that. We've seen this whole initiative around consumer directed healthcare savings accounts. It's forecast to be $100 billion industry in 2010. We know boomers like me are aging and we're going to demand a different level of healthcare services and more personalized treatment and care. These are opportunities for you as you think about businesses you may want to go into. So I leave you really thinking about this thing about how can you make a difference, whether it's in the nonprofit world or the for profit world, how can you think about the entrepreneurship that you may endeavor in terms of service. And I think really what I've laid out for you here today is really been a great gift to me. It's allowed me to actually think about my current business in light of all my other businesses and services. And that's a gift. So thank you. Thank you. Questions. Go ahead. I'm sorry about this kind of phenomenon on the web right now of bringing the power to the consumer in your case of bringing the information to the consumer. With the DNA testing, there's a lot of ethical issues around, for example, deciding whether or not to test for something because of what options there are to do once you find out whether or not you carry a key, for example. So what I just might have to have in place for allowing the consumer to think through those issues before they decide whether or not to test for a specific person. Sure. Let me reiterate your question. I believe what you're really asking is does a site like DNA direct help people think through whether or not a test is going to be useful to them or a really beneficial. And I think this is really the crux of what genetic counseling is. That's what people do really on a one on one. And we've really tried to replicate that that whole experience for our users on the web. So it's very much around this whole idea of informed consent. We try to help people think through. Well, you know, people who are of Ashkenazi descent have a very high likelihood of having a breast cancer mutation that would put them at high risk for breast cancer. People of other ethnicities are in a very different level of risk factor for that. And we try to help people think through the pros and cons of testing. But you're absolutely right. The ethical issues involved in this are important. And I think that is really a very good use of the web. I'm a strong believer that those kinds of thoughtful decisions are actually often made best in the privacy of your own home when you as an individual are just looking up and doing that research. You don't have the pressure of somebody talking at you or you know you're looking at your watch wondering you know you're parking meter expiring. It's a very different experience. And I think informed consent is very appropriate for a web. Yes. You have this amazing very true. What did I want to be when I grew up as a kid? I think I didn't have a career path in mind. I wanted to make a difference. I didn't want to just do a me too. And maybe it's because I was one of seven kids. I felt like at the end of that litter of kids that I really had to stand out one way or another. So that's what I've been after is. And I think when I look at why did I start different things. I started it because I didn't see somebody else doing it. It wasn't that I thought I could do something faster, cheaper, better. It was because there was something that was fundamentally happening that wasn't happening in a way that I thought it could be done. And I thought I could you know, edge it forward. Yes. I'm not sure what the legal situation is right now but what do you think about the use of insurance companies maybe in the future requiring people to undergo genetic testing and using that to charge the premiums? The question around what's going to happen with insurance around genetic information and how do I feel about insurance companies having access to that information and misusing it? I should say I'm a strong supporter of a Senate bill that passed unanimously last year for genetic to protect genetic discrimination both by employers and insurance companies. But the sad news is that that bill that passed unanimously has passed before in the Senate and has never been approved by the House and it's languishing today. And it's languishing I understand in part because of the Chamber of Commerce and pressures that they're getting from potentially from insurance regulators. I don't know that but that is the word that is out there. I think insurance companies say they don't want to use this information and they don't want to misuse it. But I think having some kind of regulatory legal regulatory issues involved in this would be very helpful for consumers for protection. At DNA Direct we allow people to test, well I shouldn't say we allow them, all of our customers tested DNA Direct with anonymity. We allow them to add their own name onto the medical to their lab report at their choosing if they want it to submit it for insurance purposes. Most of our customers appreciate that anonymity because they don't really know how this is going to play out and they want to ensure confidentiality around it. But I've got to say it's not the number one reason a lot of people feel so strongly about getting the test and getting access to it. That's why they test with us. Yes. Well that's correct. That's correct. Hippas is about a lot of things including the protection and confidentiality of your medical information by healthcare professionals. But yes you do technically have access to your medical record but try getting it. I mean it is not easy and in fact for many patients when they go to request information from their physician because they want to take their medical chart and share it with another physician for a second opinion. So if you really raise this alarm with your primary doc it's as if you don't trust them. And I think what Plain Tree was trying to do and those early days was to say put the patient medical record right at the bedside. Let the patient look at every note and comment that's going on in the hospital so that they can actually go back to the doc and say you know I wasn't that that medication was making me anxious. It was making me sleepy. Let's correct that for the record you know so that they could actually inform that medical record that is not happening today. It's got a long ways to go. Yes and back. You mentioned that patients were less worried that it's when they had access to information. Yes. So in general we have insurance industry. How to use their focus on using costs that there's been a different way to get things started. So in that particular example you are suggesting that you get a customer that's if the information that's litigation over the cost. That's what insurance company might put support at some extent. Have you looked at different ways you can sort of let it that insurance cost for the street interest. You are in cost. You have more interest. Right. The question is correct me if I'm not quite getting it but the question is really around the fact that litigation drives a lot of what goes on around healthcare. And are there ways to actually leverage their interest in creating safeguards like open access to medical records to better serve the patient. And I think that what you've touched on here is a very interesting problem. And it's one that I see as one of the big bottlenecks in healthcare is that because of the fear of litigation a lot of things don't come to pass. And a lot of things that do come to pass only come to pass because of because it's going to be a way that anesthesiologists can actually reduce mortality at the bedside in the ICU. I mean it's so much driven by this fear of malpractice that some things that are just going to be good practice, good care that don't have that same kind of ROI never advance in healthcare. And genetic testing in some cases is one of those. Yes, it's just going to inform the patient it's going to inform an 18-year-old woman who's on birth control pills who might be at high risk for blood clotting that birth control pills may not be a good choice. But you know what those things are not yet big problems for the insurance industry around litigation. And so it doesn't get integrated. But I'm always thinking about how to use that as a tool and it's a tricky one. It's a double-edged sword. Yes. Do you consider the things that you've done to be social entrepreneurship? What do you think of that? I do. I mean I think social entrepreneurship is very often refers to people who operate in the nonprofit world but really are entrepreneurs meaning that they're looked at as businesses. They're just not looked at as traditional nonprofit membership clubs or things like that. They're really trying to fair it. Is there a way that you know patients or I'm sorry that users would would pay for the service and see value in it? And so I think social entrepreneurship is a fine name for that. Yes. In terms of potential gold mine for this technology. Have you been a poach? Are you looking at groups? Let's say the military that like want to do screening on large numbers of enlistees for professional sports or entertainment. Those types of areas where you know peak performance is at a premium and spending two or three or three hundred dollars five hundred thousand is really like a drop in the buck in terms of results. Right. The question is are there large buyers of the service for athletes or other areas like the military that may want to utilize genetic testing services. And I haven't gone after those particular markets yet but we are looking at aggregators for some of our genetic testing services. So you know in addition to going to direct a consumer so it's a good thought. I'll take one more question because I'm sensitive to your timing and then we can continue outside if any of you want to join me. Yes and back. The question about the Japanese market. We have not yet really gone international. We are starting to get requests internationally for genetic testing. Every country has different policies around the shipment of DNA around the whole field of genetics who can interpret who can order a test. And we've really spent a lot of time solving how we can do that through all the states because of course every state here in the US has different regulations regarding providing medical services. So we've nailed those down and we'll be starting probably next year on the international markets. So with that I hope you guys can join me outside.
