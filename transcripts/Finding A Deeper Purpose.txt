 Who you are defines how you build. This is the OddPrinarial Thought Leaders Series. Brought to you by Stanford E Corner. Welcome, YouTube and Stanford communities to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders seminar at Stanford University. I am Ravi Belani, the managing director of Alchemist and accelerator for enterprise startups and a lecture in the Management Science and Engineering department at Stanford. Today, we are kicking off the spring quarter in the deep end. We're going deep, and I don't mean just in terms of just deep entrepreneurship, but deep purpose. And so there are a few people that we could think of that could be better than kicking off the spring quarter than Rangie Gulati from Harvard Business School. Rangie Gulati is the Paul R. Lawrence MBA class of 1942 professor of business administration at Harvard Business School. He's a school and the former unit head of the organizational behavior unit at Harvard Business School. He's an expert on leadership in turbulent times and has studied and written about the topic for the past 25 years. His latest book, which is published in February, is entitled Deep Purpose, the heart and soul of high performing companies. And it shows how companies can embed purpose much more deeply than they currently do. And that is going to be the focus of our session today. Now, Rangie himself graduated with bachelor's degrees in computer science and economics, then went on to get a master's in management from MIT and then a PhD from Harvard. Before he was a professor at Harvard Business School, he was a professor at Kellogg, and he wasn't just a professor. He won the award for outstanding for best the best professor award at Kellogg and run jays also been ranked as one of the 10 most cited scholars in economics and business over a decade. Because of the gravity of knowledge that run j brings and the limited time that we have today. We're going to before we jump into a fireside chat with run jay, we're going to invite run jay just to share anything that he wants to with our community and extended YouTube communities and any takeaways from his book Deep Purpose. So everybody, please welcome run jay. Thank you so much, Robbie, for that introduction. It's a pleasure to be here with all of you today. And I'm delighted to have a chance to talk to you all about my research. And as you know, I will do a quick job in trying to summarize some of the key findings from this project. And then I'm going to turn it over to a conversation with Robbie and open it up to Q and A as well. So this topic, if you told me five years ago, run jay, you're going to write a book about purpose. I would have said you're crazy. Purpose mission statements. I mean, this is like businesses are here to survive and thrive. And I was studying growth companies. I was studying fast growth companies, small and large. So I had an interest. I had an ongoing project looking at rapidly scaling organizations. And I was looking at how do they scale up in both good times and bad. I looked in down markets up markets. And the basic thesis was that business need to do two things right. Figure out a good strategy which markets are you going to play in, which is your value proposition. What's going to be unique about you? How do you build more so down your strategy? And then you're going to get it done. Get the job done. Right. So much of my work was all around these two buckets, helping you find the good strategy and then helping you execute the strategy. And I thought that's it. And then I discovered actually it came to me by looking at some fast growth startups where founders would start lamenting the loss of something. We've grown too big. We've lost that entrepreneurial kind of mindset. You know, there's something getting lost. And in some cases, the founders would leave and come right back. You know, you saw that Steve Jobs coming back to Apple. You saw that actually Howard Schultz is coming back for the third time to Starbucks. Phil Knight who founded Nike King kept coming and going and going and going. You saw that Google. So you start to see this kind of like, oh my god, my, my baby has lost something. This soul of a startup. And so I really probe this issue and I had seen it in my own family business. My mother has started a business event from zero to several thousand employees in a couple of years. And she also talked to me. I was a teenager. She was like, something is just not fun anymore. It's just not the same feeling. And so that was kind of the real. There was a fashion startup she had. So that's the image. And then even at large scale, you saw that with companies like, you know, the Microsoft turn on the such a wrote about in his book. He said, look, what we discovered was we had lost our purpose. And so I started to hear the word purpose intention that somehow businesses must have a purpose. And this purpose can be an animating force that energizes people in the organization. So it's not just about having an idea. It's not just saying an idea. I have a big idea. Let me show you the idea. It's about I have an idea. I want to change the way things get done in my industry. I want to change this marketplace. I want to change the way customers experience things. And purpose is not just social stuff. It's not saving the Amazon for us only. You know, look at Amazon's founding. I want to change the customer experience. Period. I want to change the way they experience something. So I discovered it wasn't just an idea. It was about having an idea. And so this thing called purpose was confusing because the way we teach it in management is saying, you know, business need to have tactics. The immediate one to two year. They need to have a strategy. They need to have a vision. And they need to have a mission and mission is out there long term. Who cares right now? I'm going to survive. I want to build a business. And when I discovered was great organizations start to think about their purpose very, very early. If you look at some amazing, successful companies in the last decade, if you look at Etsy, very purpose driven. You look at Warby Parker, very purpose driven. You look at Gotham Green, which is an aggro tech company, purpose driven. You look at Livongo that sold to Teladoc for $18.5 billion to years ago. Purpose driven. So you start to see some of these startups. If you were we have found the start to talk about this notion of having a purpose. Now, there's a lot of cynicism about this purpose stuff, too, because a lot of companies engaging what we call purpose washing. Also called virtue signaling. Also called virtue cloaking. And if you look at this is an article written a couple of years ago called sex lies and mission statements. Look at that in your neck of the woods. There are no had a purpose. And one had a purpose. Facebook has a purpose. Purdue pharmaceuticals that let the oxy content explosion also had a purpose. So there's a lot of kind of cynicism, especially in tech. I think people say like, you know, there's a lot of this smoke smoke blowing my way. You know, I don't buy this. And that's why actually, Ravi to your earlier comment. I wanted to call my book purpose, but I couldn't because I saw a lot of superficial purpose. But I also saw some deep purpose. And I want to convince you. I hope in the next few minutes that purpose is good for business. First of all, I'll show you some data. There was intriguing data showing a coordination between purpose and performance. Right. And then there was, of course, you can go back to read the little prince and you'll see about how purpose is an energizing thing and it inspires people to do wonderful things. But I want to quickly explain to you three things. What is purpose. Why does it matter? And how do you do it? So how about I try to explain my entire book to you in the next seven minutes. And I'll try to speak fast. That's what is purpose. Right. People think of purposes, very individual construct. In fact, I would like to kind of talk about the best definition I found is by a psychologist in your university. William Damon wrote an excellent book where he talked about purpose is a stabilized and generalized intention to accomplish something that is at the same time meaningful to the self and consequential to the world beyond the self. So we understand it at the individual level. We don't kind of get what does it mean at an organization level? Is it social stuff? Is it economic stuff? What is it? And people think is it a mission statement? I got a mission statement now. And actually what purpose is is not a purpose statement. It's about an idea. Why do we want to exist as a business? And when you are forced to answer that question, it forces you to clarify your strategy, your vision for the future. What are you aspiring to be? Why are you here? I have now interviewed a large number of venture capitalists who now are talking about this is a kind of filtering mechanism. I want entrepreneurs to not just come with an idea. I want them to say in an expansive way, how do we want to make a difference in the world? And I said here, commercial, I didn't say social, I'm not saying say the Amazon first. Now a purpose has an ambition in it. We have goals. We are going to do this. We also have sense of duties in it. Here's how we plan to make a difference in our customer's lives. Here's how we plan to make a difference in the community. Here are the problems we want to solve. If you try to build a business, who are stakeholders? Everyone can confuse the stakeholders as an environment. The planet is one stakeholder. Yes, stakeholders are employees, stakeholders are customers, stakeholders are the communities in which you're going to operate and stakeholders are the planet. And the problem is the fact that we're not imagining a business that is going to have a positive impact on customers, employees and the communities and maybe the planet even. What are the problems you're trying to solve? And it is how you're trying to build a business in the long term. It's not some kind of one-liner statement only. It's really about how you're imagining a business. What is the reason for its existence? What if it sees to exist? What would happen? You might say, why does it matter? I'm so busy. We're trying to build a business here, survive, raise money, deal with burn rein, understand what I could do. How are we going to hire people? Why does it matter? The purpose actually serves four functions. I'm not going to show you the empirical data to prove the point to you because the data itself is being worked out. I think there are four real benefits. First, purpose is a compass. It gives you directional clarity. As you're trying to imagine what your strategy for growth is, it clarifies to you where you want to play and where you don't want to be. Once you've articulated a purpose for the business, it gives you structured and clarity about where you want to play. It allows you to look expansively and narrowly at what you're trying to accomplish. What's the space in which we're working and which problems do we want to solve? It's motivational. Live on, go, that is based right out of the Bay Area. We built an app for Diabetic. The first idea was no tech engineer wants to go work for a healthcare company. They were working tech companies. We can't even pay competitive wages. But they were building an app for Diabetic. They didn't say Diabetic. People would die. They didn't want to identify a person by their disease. Almost half the employees had some person connection to diabetes in their families, either themselves or somebody else around them. So having an ambition can be in, in, in, inspired to people, especially if it connects to them in a very personal way. I want to be part of that. Again, it can't be smoke and mirrors. If it's one of those smoke and mirrors, people are going to see right through it. And they're going to hold you accountable for it when you don't live up to your focus. You're going to have whistleblowers, you're going to have people complaining. Look what's happening as Spotify, look what's happening at Disney, look what happened at Facebook. So you've got to understand that if you're dialing into people wanting to come and work for you because they're inspired. I want to just clarify to you with a quick HR story here. For the longest time, companies will focus on creating satisfaction at work. It then moved into creating engagement. Now the Holy Grail is creating inspiration at work. How do I get people to feel inspired by where they live? And how do we do that? How do we tap into that and inspired workers are 2.2 times as productive as satisfied workers? Then you get to the most important pieces of my which is relation. And relational is all about the ability to build relationships with other entities outside of yourself. I don't need to preach to you by the power of ecosystems and platforms and engagement today. Well, what I'm finding is there's emerging evidence of businesses that have a clearly articulated purpose orientation, not a smoke and mirrors real deep purpose. So you're able to build more trusting connections with other partners than other companies. Because purpose becomes kind of a marker for our beliefs and value systems. This is who we are. This is what we stand for. This is what we believe in. And it makes it easier to build that connection. I am sure you know this more than 50% of partnerships fail. So here you are running around saying, I want to build an ecosystem on a platform or more than half of them are going to fail. So how do you break through that? And the last one is reputation. This is a huge body of work now on purpose branding that customers trust companies that have a clearly articulated purpose. There's all this work on purpose branding going on right now. And so I would like to say to you that if you bring to business with a purpose from the ground up, you're going to have clarity like a compass. And you're going to have an operating system where employees are more motivated partnerships are more real and trust based and customer trust you know. So purpose is valuable is my experience now comes the last part of the puzzle. How do you do so what I've described to you is chapter one and two. Now I get to the last six chapters and two months. This is what I found scared it's really easy to talk about purpose among a few senior leaders. Maybe the founder gets there and he's a team together and talk about it. But as you once you start growing, there's an exponential decay in purpose. It's kind of like a few people will kind of holding hand and singing kumbaya and doing an offside together. But how do you bring it alive for the people in the organization? That is the story. And the late Jim March, who was a professor at Stanford in this graduate school of business and also the school of education said leaders have to not just be plumbers, but they have to be poets. You see plumbing stuff is easy. Build the organization get an all chart and plays get the financial model working build a strategy, understand your customers and markets that's plumbing. Poetry is about inspiring people. How do I get people excited to be here? How do I get them really energized? So as you start to say I want to build an organization that has a purpose, you have to start thinking about what your job as a leader is. How are you going to elevate people? And you can see all the kind of phenomenal startups that you see that have grown. Majority of them, not all of them, but the majority of them have somebody who plays the role of a poet who really knows how to elevate people thinking in that process. So I want to just, you know, in the interest of time, I want to just summarize my kind of big picture takeaway. I think it's important to understand that purpose is not a purpose statement. It's really an animating idea. It's why we exist. It has an ambition of goals. It has a sense of duties. It's long term in an embraces the array of stakeholders to whom you want to serve. Right. Why do we want to do that? It's motivational. It's directional. It's relational and it's reputational. But the hardest part is actually turning ideas into action. And that's going to be, that's where you're going to have to go and read my book if you want to know more. But I just want to highlight to you the notion that I think when we are in startup mode, we kind of get lost in this notion that I just got to build a business and survive. It's never too early to articulate a focus for your business. It will force you to think about the strategy for the business and he forced you to craft what you have vision for where this business is going to go. And it can become an anchor for the culture you're trying to create in the organization. It becomes a mechanism to attract talent and attract capital. What kind of capital do you want to attract to the business? And I think it's something that is an energizing force. And you know, in business today, I feel we have really ignored purpose because we became so cynical about it because people just started into a smoke and mid-exercise. So my wish for all of you here is to think hard about this stuff. Think hard about should I be thinking about purpose if I was to embark on it and if you're going to work for one, ask yourself this question. Does my this company have a purpose and does the company purpose resonate with my personal purpose? Now you might say, Ranjab, you have to have a purpose. And you're never too young to have a purpose. If you have a purpose, it creates greater intentionality in your life. You're much more proactive. You have a more deliberate sense of where you're going and why you're going there. But looking for that personal resonance with purpose. And by the way, research and biology shows that people who have a purpose live longer or healthier, don't get sick that often or living much more healthier productive lives. So there you have it. So find your purpose connected to the organization where you choose to work or the one you're going to start. And I think that would be the key to success. Ravi, I want to turn it back to you. Ranjab, thank you. There is so much deep, obviously deep stuff here that I want to impact. And I want to make sure that some of these points aren't lost. I want to actually key off on just what you ended with, which was there's this connection between every individual, every student, right now at Stanford, you're saying does have a purpose and needs to map that to an organization. Is that first of all true. Do you believe that every individual has a purpose? Every individual should have a purpose. I think many of most of us wait a long time. It's kind of like a midlife thing you do one day, I'll wake up and think about purpose. I think after COVID, there is a meaning that we should going on. I think people expect much more from work. One of the leaders I interviewed, he said to me, he said, you know, think about the phrase work life damage. I said, that's a very pernicious phrase that you know, work life as if there's work and then there's my life. We spend most of our time at work. So I'm going to hold my nose at work and then I go and live my life on five days, Saturday, Sunday, or what am I doing here? How can I make work a meaningful part of my existence? But to understand that, I have to first interrogate myself and William Damon has his great book on asking yourself to say, think about your purpose. And I think it's a powerful unlock. In fact, if you still are not convinced, one of the organization I studied was the Seattle Seahawks. And I interviewed the coach Pete Carroll and the team psychologist as well, Michael Jervais. And it's interesting, even in performance athletics, high of other highest of levels. The unlock to get people to perform is to really connect into their purpose. Purpose elevators us. It gets us to perform at levels that we would not think about. So my wish for you is to think about your purpose and then try to connect it to wherever you're going to work to make personal purpose connect to the company purpose. And I want to make sure this point's not lost because this is a conversation we do not have enough when it comes to entrepreneurship because in your books and in your articles, you're not talking just about purpose, you're talking about deep purpose. And even within the articles, you talk about the company's soul. It's almost like they're you're talking about a spiritual dimension that we don't oftentimes discuss. And even for the individual, it feels like it's more about their calling. It's something deeper or more rooted. I wonder if you can just expound upon this because I want to make sure that the students get this. I want to talk about how companies has a soul just almost as individuals do and that this is not purpose is deep purpose is not as simple as saying simply cultural norms to design to shape behavior. But these effects run deeper. They spark a different more intense kind of commitment and performance. And what I love is when you say they shape the meaning of work rendering work relational instead of merely transactional. So I want to make sure that the students understand this. And so when you're talking about deep purpose, is it fair to say you're talking about understanding your individual calling and a company's soul. And if so, when do you know when you've actually because I think many individuals have callings and they don't know what they're calling is until later, when do you know that you've clicked into deep purpose. Ravi, that's a great question. There's a lot of that question. So let me try to unpack it for you there. Okay. It's a very fun. Let me start of the organization. Okay. And then I turn back to the individual. Remember, for us, human beings purpose is a layered constrict. There is my personal life purpose. I want to do whatever I want to climb out Everest. I want to do whatever I want to do. I want to have a meaningful life in some other way. Then there is my job purpose. I don't want to get out of my job. And how does that connect into my life. Then there is career purpose. I have a purpose in my career. So these are layered ideas that we all should be thinking about. And until for many years, we've always sort of work life balance that there's my work and then is my life. So purpose is in my life work is just a job. And you know, economists and us organization, they've played into this. The art theory of organizations is firms are nexus of contracts. And that image, the idea is the business is basically a business with everyone has a contract with and our contract is pay for performance, which I call the coin operated monkey theory of management where our monkeys. You put a coin in us will dance for you. You put two coins. I'll dance twice for you. You make the dance fun for me. I'll dance even more for you. But I'm a coin operated monkey. Keep putting coins. I'll keep dancing. And by the way, that model actually does work. A lot of people are inspired and motivated by pay for performance. How many coins are you going to drop in the in the tiller and I'll dance for you. And it works. I'm not saying anything against that and some of us are inspired by that. That's wonderful. I think people. I think that's one of the things that we want to do is to make a difference in the world. And we want to make a difference in the world. And we want to make a difference in the world. And we want to make a difference in the world. And we want to make a difference in the world. And we want to make a difference in the world. And you know, you see how they talk nostalgic about how they accomplished. They were here to change the world. You know, so you start to see how do I find my own coin and dial into the organization that I want to work. So it's a resonates with me. And so work is no longer a job. It's not a pay for performance only. I want to get paid. I'm not saying I don't want to get paid. But how do I get more than just money out of there? Yes, yes. And I also want to underscore this point that you say that we need to talk about purpose from day zero. And I do think that even though we're having this conversation, the zeitgeist in Silicon Valley is is that purpose. When we talk about purpose or these ideals, it's relegated as something that's really discretionary. At the end of the day, people will listen, but they'll view it as motherhood and apple pie. And they'll think that what they really need to focus on is product market fit. That's really entrepreneurship. Or as you say in one of your articles, you know, Mark Andrewsson says everything that matters is product market fit. And the venture capital is going to measure me on growth rates and unit economic rates. And when you're starting out, it's an existential threat. Can you speak to that? So are you saying at day zero when a company is very survival is at stake that a founder needs to prioritize their precious limited time to thinking about purpose? And then if so, how we're in a school of engineering, everybody loves to measure things. If the definition of purpose is this animated idea, you can measure unit economics, you can measure product market fit. How do we measure the purpose? Both excellent questions. So first of all, I think is I am nothing against product market fit. I think we need that. We need to understand unit economics. We need to understand the engine that is going to build a business around us. I think what happens is we start narrow, very quickly. And I think we then loop this out on the opportunity to think expansively about our business. What space are we in? What are the problems we want to solve? We get caught up in the product market fit and sometimes we abstract away adjacent problem we could be solving. So we miss adjacent season our markets. We miss opportunities around in adjacent areas. So I think purpose is a wonderful vehicle to also sharpen your product market fit in an expansive way. I think also is a wonderful way to talk about it. You know, found out entrepreneur selling all the time selling their business to not only venture capital to raise money but also to new employees to everybody. How do you talk the top? Limited amount of product market fit. No, limited amount of my expansive motion of what my business is all about. So it even from a building a narrative, it gets you to build a narrative you want to call it a elevator page, whatever you want to call it. But now you come to the next part of the group. How do you measure yourself? How do I know am I? How how am I measuring my product model and my purpose over here? How am I doing on that? Very hard question. And I think this is where it gets objective very fast. I think the only way to start to imagine ask after this question is to what degree am I living our purpose? How much do we reference and talk about our purpose when we think about our strategy and our product market fit? When we are hiring people and employees and even thinking of promoting people, how often do we think about purpose orientation? When we on board new people, do we talk about our purpose? Is it something that is just wallpaper or is it lived purpose? How clear are we about our purpose in our communication with our customers and our ecosystem partners? So I think it is subjective inherently. I think it's also it's never too early. It gives you the, I mean I told you at a very basic level it gives you a narrative to talk about. But I think it is that makes it shallow purpose. That's all you're doing. I need to say a speech. Thank you Ranjay. I got it. I got that to Lana. You wanted me to do all this is about elevator pitch. That's all you want to talk about. Elevator pitch. Yes, but what if you took the elevator pitch seriously? What if you try to translate that into something bigger? You're unlocking huge possibility. Terrific. Thanks Ranjay. So Ranjay, I do we are seeing all these signs about how society is rewarding companies for being more transcendent outside of the traditional scope of what a business is. And I do think that companies today are being compelled to take stances on social justice issues. The most, you know, the most salient example of that today is the Russian Ukraine crisis and how corporates are self sanctioning beyond what legally is required and they're expected to and society is holding them accountable if they're not. I wondered if you could comment about that trend because I think there's also more controversial social justice issues where corporates are pressured to take stances and face risks where they'll marginalize some individuals in the companies where their individual sense of purpose suddenly now doesn't overlap with the companies. And many would argue that historically company leaders should have been apolitical because you want to encourage a diversity of employee thought and stakeholder thought and not take sides. So when you address whether or not leaders and corporates should take stances on issues of social justice and how do they navigate that. So without even offering my own opinion on that, I will tell you we're in a new world. And Ukraine, the tragedy in Ukraine and what's happening now with Russia, I think has been a game changer in that suddenly now businesses are being forced to take geopolitical sense. Right, not just kind of local domestic politics, this is geopolitical we're choosing sides. Now in some level, this one is a black and whiteish as you said, you know, the answer of what is right and wrong was pretty clear and you've got to commend businesses for being ahead of governments. They moved fast and the ones who didn't move fast were penalized quickly and moved quickly after that. So you had Zara saying we're out of Russia, we're shutting down right now and unique, closing is a human right and maybe we want to hang around and we want to sell close to Russians. Come on and five days later they're gone too. Right, so but these were easy ones the harder ones are going to be where now businesses have to choose between domestic political issues. You know, and you can see where the answers are not so clear and I think it's not governments. I thought it was going to be governments who are going to pressure us businesses to suddenly say listen stop being designed on the item of business. I don't get involved. That's not a sideline is not acceptable anymore. And but you see now employees and customers becoming much more. And pressure and companies to say you got to take a position. Business is a great example of that what happened recently. Spotify, you know employee rebellion, Spotify was trying to fudge it and say no Joe Rogan, you know, it's okay. He's so popular, you know, we spent so much money on it and they're like no, not accepting. Right, and so you're seeing much more or delta airline with voting rights. Now here is the dilemma I think for businesses is you can either be reacting to pressure and say okay when the pressure is too much we got to do something. Right, so then you're entirely reacting. What I discovered was organizations that have a clearly articulated purpose. Having easier time navigating through this complexity saying that's not what we do. So Etsy for instance is a company I looked at and as I see they made they have their commercial economic goals they want to build a thriving marketplace. But they have three social goals. There was outline and they're measuring themselves on them by the way. Three are diversity equity inclusion sustainability and enabling our sellers economic impact and proving that. That's it. We don't really for issue five issues. And that's it. So any other issues come away. Sorry, not our thing. We got three we measure them. We do this. We go deep in these three we're not being four or five six issues. So we're not involved. So you know how by articulating a purpose it also gives you a little bit of buffering from what is now going to be a barrage of expectations on you on walking this multi stake folder. And that's a more economic decision making political decision making that is going to come over. All right terrific thank you. I'm going to go into Q&A in a bit but I'm going to ask one final question which is. I think all the students at Stanford right now are likely many many of them know what their purposes are is are many of them don't even know what their majors should be. And you know and so I think there's this question of if suddenly we're going to bring to light that everybody should start thinking about purposes. I'm wondering for those individuals that don't know what their purposes or don't know what they're calling is. Any advice that you can give and actually ask actually to begin with run Jay can you share personally for yourself. Do you have a purpose for for yourself individually and when did you know your deep purpose and when did that happen in life and and how did that occur. So, Ravi again another really great question. So first of all purpose is a is an evolving constant right it's not like I had it nailed down when I was 18 and I'll pull it out right now and show you it's still the same. Not at all right my purpose as you ball over time and there were moments in my life when all it was really primarily but just having a career I wanted to be an academic and I wanted to hopefully get a job in a decent place where I felt I could teach really smart students right. So purpose is something but you have to start asking that question what energizes me what excites me when do I feel fulfilled what really makes me feel good about myself when do I show up at my best self. One if I was to ask myself if I see to exist what would be the one thing I want to be remembered by and actually I'll just share with you one that you know one of my good friends is a is the CEO of panetta and he had a real tragedy in his life his daughter when she was 13 years old found out her name was I should challenge me and she found out that she was going to die the parents found out and they decided to tell her and she had like three four years left. Now imagine if you're 13 years old and you know that you're not going to go to college you're going to be dead high school is it. And her story actually was made into a body would movie called the sky is pink in on Netflix can be watched with subtitles if you want. And how she then uses that time to say I am confronting my mortality. And so maybe I need to ask myself why am I here. She did a couple of dead dogs she wrote a book and her rumination of a young kid confronting such a tragic moment is so inspired I don't wish that on any of you. But say how to receive jobs by you right his kind of amazing speech to your commencement was a part of it was him confronting his own mortality now. I think why should we wait till we have to confirm our mortality to interrogate our certain questions but I think we can learn a lot from them so look up I should challenge me and see what she has to say she's got a couple of dead dogs out there. And the movie and you see that I think it's never too early to ask us if this question. Why am I here what if I see this what do I want to me does my last thing legacy how do I think I can make a meaningful car I put up the definition here by William Damon again. It's a generalized table and general attention to accomplish something that at the same time meaningful to me and consequential to the world want what gives me meaning and how do I want to make a contribution to the world around me. I think those are fair questions to be asking and those things with some my purpose today is I my purpose is to educate leaders who make a positive difference in the world. That's what I see my purpose as I feel that you know if I can accomplish that that is how I can make a difference in the world it's meaningful to me and I believe is my limited way to have some consequential impact on the world beyond it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Renjai. We're going to go to the student questions and gang I'm going to go based on meritocratic order so if you upflow ones I'll try to put more attention on. There's a desire to talk more about purpose and social purposes versus market purposes so the question is I'd like to hear more about how much of purpose is bound by social purposes versus market purposes. Do you want to react to that? That's an excellent question and I'm so glad you asked that question. I myself got very confused because the world purpose has been hijacked. It's been hijacked by both extremes on the one side of people say purpose of businesses shareholder value leave them alone to focus on making money. All this other stuff is a distraction and attacks on business. That's the government's job you know or regulators job. Businesses job is to focus on shareholders. The other extreme has come along is that purpose is anything but shareholder value. Shareholder value is bad. It's about making doing good things for society anything but profit. And then what happens is so people start to do this purpose thing as a side hobby. It's the real tax on business. It's a CSR ESG get it out of there called a foundation. Whatever you want to do I'll give you a day a month to go and do some volunteer work. Whatever whatever and then there is a field good exercise. Actually purpose is about both. It gets to the very core of your business what's the economic engine you're trying to build. And how is that economic engine going to have a commercial and social impact. And I think that's where we have to take it. How does what we do make a difference in the world? And and run Jay what if but if you're trying to thread the needle between both there is that danger of becoming motherhood and apple pie becoming all those mission statements that you put up before that appease everything but ultimately mean nothing. How do you make sure that you're actually just not doing that and you're just drinking your own cool aid saying that I have this but really you don't have deep purpose. Thanks for calling that out. I dug myself a whole year so let me try to dig myself out of it actually because actually Ravi is right. There's another little wrinkle in this people started to say oh so run Jay you're saying purpose is win win right when win meaning when you can do both social and commercial at the same time right is that magical thread the needle where you've got both happening. You know I'm lending money and micro finance to poor people in Bangladesh at 20% because the government market banks charge you know money lender charge them 100%. So 20% is more than what they could get in the city but they don't go to the city so I'm bringing money to them at 20% and I'm making money and I'm doing a good thing win win. Most of life is not win win it's really hard to get to win. So you end up imagine a two by two of market impact and social impact right to use your language and you say well I have some things that are purely social I have something that are purely market and I have a few face that I'm accomplishing both. Do I only do both and I think that's not true there are some things that are purely market and don't have a social impact something that are purely social that don't have a marketing time. How I manage that portfolio of activities so you have to take a portfolio view of that and say not everything is going to be win win but I have to ask myself what is the in aggregation how are we going to make the fees right so at one level you might say a company like and I'm going to do it. I say a company like and Etsy is you know commerce making commerce human it's helping sellers of craft sell to buyers so they create livelihood and jobs and so maybe there's a social element there but ultimately there are marketplace also so how do we unpack and think about what social what is commercial and how do I blend the two together. I think it's a very important question and not an easy answer because you have to justify the portfolio and if you have a legacy business you know like look at British petroleum they want to get out of oil and gas they want to be beyond petroleum BP but it's not going to happen overnight so you have to find a transitional journey on your Pepsi trying to go beyond selling junk food and cola you can't do it overnight so how you're going to get there so how do you balance that portfolio is the part that I think is not so easy I call it walking on the race. Walking on the razor's edge. Yep. Okay, thank you, thank you Ranjay the next question that has most up votes is if you found a time machine went back and had a few minutes to chat with your 20 something year old self what would you tell him. That's a great question my god you guys are smart oh okay and asking me zingers you know these are tough questions. You know I think I honestly had never thought about my purpose I was so fixated on narrow career success and I hadn't allowed myself the space to even imagine that I had the possibility to impact something beyond myself. I think it was I don't know if it was a bit narcissistic but it was a little self fixation and I hadn't you know and what you discover it by the way if you haven't read some research on the psychology of happiness what makes us happy so that's an interesting body of work there's a lot of work by Martin Seligman at Penn and others and it's interesting what they find the first thing is if you look at activities and attitudes activities come in two flavors. What are you passionate about and how do you want to make a contribution to something beyond yourself those are the two unlocks for happiness on activities right I didn't know what I was passionate about nor did I ever think about how I can make a contribution to anybody except myself then it came to attitudes the two unlocks for attitudes are interesting the first one is gratitude does our gratitude makes a huge difference to unlocking happening. And the second one is compassion which leads to non-judgment and engagement I can tell you if I was to tell myself those four things I think I would have been a much happier younger person but you know we are in the mode of striving and we think we're happy can I like you know jumping around and having a good time and you know I think you don't even know what it means to be happy. I agree thank you thank you runj that's that's fantastic you're already having deep impact as well as deep purpose today I'm going to move to the next questions there's a bunch and I know we're not going to get through everything this next question is at what level should an organizations purpose be defined and articulated i.e. how detailed slash specific versus broad slash general should it be and if there's guidance especially for startups when we have you know young companies that are just starting I think that might also be helpful. So it's another really excellent question and there's actually a working professor who studies narrative of companies and he points out of paradox is there is broo carton c a r t o n if you want to look it up and do says that these statements have an inherent paradox the more general abstract they are the harder it is for people to be low to relate to the most specific they are then you have another problem is that. So I think what we need is you need the general statement but you also need to be able to translate it into a set of concrete principles and actions people should consider. So having a general statement along with some translation of it now having said that so that's one thing have a general statement but make sure it's translate to people who understand it having said that I looked at one company goth and green if you haven't seen goth and green there in San Francisco also they're using urban rooftops for hydroponic farming. And if you go to whole foods and buy salad or herbs you're going to find goth and green over there in New York they're on the rooftop of whole foods and very successful has raised several rounds of venture finding great guy whether they are I think very purpose driven but they don't have a purpose statement. So I asked the founder village puri are like come on i'm studying purpose you need to have a narrative is a we don't need one we know what it is. We have a set of core beliefs we believe in okay i'll write it down one day but you know right now we're fine. Maybe when we get bigger we need it so I think is having clarity and I think he's going to need it as he's gone across geographies they were kind of east coast based in a three or four cities and now they're all over the country they're going to need to have some way to communicate on articulate what they mean. But I think to your point I think is it has to be a general enough and aspiration has to have goals and duties but you have to then translate it into something more concrete otherwise it is just much of words. It's just to clarify the Gothen Green example you think is an example of what not to do or do you think that's. I was saying is an example of where you might not even need a purpose to. Well I think that's the norm frankly run I think most startups are going to say I don't need to spend time to articulate something right now we all know it i don't need to do this I need to go get fundraising and sales done. I would tell you you needed I would say that how are you going to tell your story what's your elevator pitch your elevator pitch is part and parcel of your purpose so if you're busy finessing your elevator pitch guess what you're doing without even realizing it you're really forcing us ever think about what's my purpose. Now you can say my elevator pitch is about a product and not about some larger thing and I would say make a pitch more expensive. Okay terrific i'm going to move forward with some other questions this questions asking how should social justice activism play into the purpose mission statement of a company. Look I don't want to have a generalize the principle on that I think it's really a function of what the founders and the founding team believe they have to believe it. The purpose is only has to be lived. Now you ask my personal opinion today I think we are at a crossroad as a society people are even asking is capitalism worth it right just think about it people are questioning whether we want to be in a capitalist system they haven't got question democratic systems yet but. At least that's under suspect right now do we know how to vote so when you have democracy under siege you have capitalism under siege you know there are larger and people are putting it right at the best of a business. And saying what are you doing about it and there are several issues but are you doing about social justice and diversity equity and inclusion what are you doing about ESG the planet how are you addressing these larger problems that we believe you have a part in causing. So and I think it can be it can be also a talent night you know we are as you all know better than me it's really hard to find the talent right now. And I think I think people want to work in places where they feel an affinity and you're going to attract the right kind of people. So how do you get people who have you know there was a French sociologist in the 19th early 1900 when the meal dirt kind. The new dirt kind. The dirt kind talked about moral. He said people who are bound together by a shared belief not in religion moral and draw them together and ideas ideals bring people together in a way that simply hey next Next is a contract what do you want how much they pay for performance pay for performance pay for performance you need that to by the way I'm not to point that but you can't only rely on just that. Let me thank you I'm going to we have we have one minute left and we're trying to put this one other question because I think it dovetails what you just said. It's a bit of a long question but let me read it as leaders we sometimes find people who have great technical capabilities and would make excellent members of the team. However, the company's purpose does not entirely resonate with them. Do you think it is wise to get them on board and help them better understand our company's purpose or is it better to find somebody else who entirely resonates with the purpose. I hate to dodge what a great question that is. So look when I have come to realize as many companies today are trying to actually help employees activate their purpose not everybody has a purpose. So Microsoft had an online program to get all that employees go through a course to think about their personal purpose. So you may encounter somebody who is never thought about it and you may believe that you know if I have them to think about their own purpose they could maybe become more accepted to our purpose. So that's one possibility but if you find complete lack of resonance. You know you need to then decide how deep purpose well. Because if you are deep purpose you're going to be looking for people who either are resonate with your purpose or have the potential to become that. Not everybody will start this is not a cult where you say filtering mechanism are you in or you are. You know and but if there is no chance they're going to be misfits then you know you're doing yourself and them are favor in that regard. And I think that's something a very good question to think about how serious are you about this in terms of the high talent raw talent that's where and I think purpose is lived when you're making trade offs so I will learn the larger point I want to make to use you can't say purpose is win win. Purpose is lived when you're making hard choices we are going to do this even if it is not economically costly to us but because it lines up when we are.
