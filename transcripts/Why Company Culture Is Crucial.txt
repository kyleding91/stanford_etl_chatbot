 You were listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader's series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. It is my distinct pleasure to welcome somebody from the right coast all the way over here on the left coast of the United States. It's particularly special because we tend to be a little optimized on California, much less the Bay Area. But here we have somebody who did not go to Stanford, went to UAB and MIT. He is well known in the entrepreneurial community in Boston because he's an angel investor. He currently is the CTO and co-founder of a public company called HubSpot. Now another ETL moment is that they just held their earnings call. As a public company, you have, you report your results every quarter. Well, they just did and it wasn't just any quarter. It was the full year of results for 2015. If you have a moment, go look at the results. They're quite spectacular for this company. Let's see. What else should I say about it? Oh, yeah. So my wake up was, I'm getting ready to do this and I've been put two and two together. Oh my gosh, this is the blogger for onstartups.com. I've been recommending onstartups.com for a long, long time because I've been reading it for a long, long time. It's 10 years old. If you have never visited that site, I urge you to have a look. It's really one of the best blogs out there having to do with entrepreneurship and innovation. So come on. Let's give a really warm and big welcome to Darmesh Shah. All right. Well, thanks Dan for the ETL for having me. A couple of quick disclaimers. I'm Darmesh, by the way. I'm on Twitter as it turns out as well. And I'm CTO. So that means this is not my natural state of being. My natural state of being is writing Python code, not being a public speaker. So bear with me if I sound nervous. It's because I'm nervous. I get better though. Trust me. So my claim to pseudo fame is I co-founded a company called HubSpot about nine and a half years ago. It's grown. Went public about a year ago and doing well. HubSpots in the marketing and sales software space. But this is not about HubSpot actually. We're going to talk about people and culture. Let's skip through this. This is the gratuitous ringing of the bell photo that must be included in every company's slide deck in at least 24 months after they go public. So this is us. And some of you might be wondering, like, Darmesh, why don't you look more excited? That's me excited right there. That's as excited as I get. And so what's that? The very last minute, one of our marketing people said, you know what? We should do something like noteworthy or remarkable that people ask us. Exactly why the sunglasses? No reason. It's like why not? So it's like, Darmesh put these sunglasses on. Okay, fine. So the company's done well. We just, as Tom mentioned, we just had our quarterly earnings call. And so the company is about $180 million in revenue last year, growing 57%, which means something because that's actually roughly hard to do with that scale. So we're proud of that. That's the last braggie slide I think I have so we can kind of get on with business. This is a safe harbor statement, which basically says I may make forward looking statements. And if I do, the future may not be what I said it was going to be. And don't buy stock based on things that I say. I'm paraphrasing, but that's what it says. And that's the key requirement. And I didn't do this for fun, just for entertainment value. So one big disclaimer is, so HubSpot's been successful. And I've been talking to entrepreneurs for a long, long time. And realize this is like one of the things that happens with startup advice generally is you have this kind of what I think I was like extrapolation from a data point of one. Essentially, we did this. And good things happen. So that must have been the right thing to do. So not all unicorns dispense thing, not everything that they did was right and not all the things that they say are necessarily applicable. So that's my ticket. Take it as it is. So I'm going to kind of tell you a story here in terms of not my life story. We'll fast forward through my times on the dusty streets of India and how that informed my notion of unity economics and SaaS businesses. So I went to school here for grad school. That's what's MIT, what some of you may recall, like the other school on that other coast somewhere, which it is. And while there at grad school, I met this guy. His name is Brian Halligan. And he's my co-founder. He's a CEO of HubSpot. So we met about 11 years ago in grad school. And the one problem was that Brian was in business school working towards an MBA. Any MBA students here? A few. I will confess. Especially with that lead up. There's probably at least a few of you that wouldn't raise your hand. And so the question is, well, why is that a problem, Darmesh? And so because there was this prevailing theory, in startup land, that says, OK, well, let's see your probability of success for some definition of success is roughly 1%. Pick it up. It's like, oh, for getting to $1 billion or whatever it is. And then there's factors that impact that probability. One of which is this very exponential factor where n is equal to number of MBAs on the early team. And so that's been like a long running thesis within the startup community for as long as I've known the startup community. So I'm like, OK, well, startups are hard. I'm about to start this thing with a co-founder that right out of the gate are odds of gone down 50%. And then like 30 seconds later, I had the realization that I also was in business school working towards. OK, well, now that's two. So that's my co-founder and I, CEO and CTO. And then we went on to hire a VP of marketing, a VP of sales, a VP of customer success, and a VP of engineering, all of which were MBAs, all from MIT's loan. And it's like, what could possibly go wrong with this picture, right? And so the reason I'm telling you this is that the talk is about people in culture. And one of the things I've learned, so I'm an engineering guy. I like code. I don't like being, I'm not psychopathic. I'm just anti-social. I like humans, OK, just don't be around them a lot, right? I like some humans. But I'm going to posit the thesis to you that not all MBAs are genetically predisposed to startup failure. They're not all schmucks and they're not all chumps. They're actually some good ones that can contribute value. And I think one of the mistakes folks like I make is we can underestimate the value of non-engineering, non-product people. As it turns out, especially in this day and age, it takes more than just building a great product to actually build something successful. And I've learned this. And so the nice thing about MBAs is they're the better ones, which we tried to hire, are super analytical. And they're not all just kind of the kind of paper pushing whatever it is, like stereotypical notion that you have about business school students. So I just wanted to spell them if right here go on record and say MBAs are not all bad. So the thing I'm going to talk about here is culture. And when I talk to startups, most of them don't spend a lot of time thinking about culture and thinking about people. It's like, OK, I'm going to walk you through some of the common reasons why entrepreneurs like culture. One is, oh, culture, we've got that figured out. We've got Marguerite Mondays. We've got a ping-pong table. We're going to do Star Trek movies on Friday afternoons or something like that. So that's rationalization number one. Number two is culture. Well, that's just something that happens organically. You don't create culture. That just sounds kind of creepy and kind of fishy. That's why we don't do that. And then there's one of my favorites is like, we're freaking changing the role, put in denting universe. That's our culture. And so those are the kind of common buckets of reasons why early stage companies don't talk about culture. And the most common one, and this is actually a legitimate one, is we've got 1,000 things to do. We're trying to raise funding. We're trying to build product. We're trying to find co-finders. We're trying to figure out how to replace the VP of engineering that was supposed to quit thing and didn't quit his thing and like all those things that are happening in early stage land, you don't have time to think about people in culture, which is probably the best reason. And I'm going to posit to you that despite all those reasons that not only should you think about culture, you should obsess over as early in the process as possible. Because of all the things you will do, that will have the time that you can spend, yes, build the product. But people is the thing that will start up to succeed or fail. And the culture is going to define, we'll talk about this, who you bring in as a co-founder, the early team, and that's going to actually influence your overall probability of success more than most other things that you will do. Most of you will start companies where the likelihood that you're able to build a product is relatively high. That's going to be fine. What's really the kind of stopping point sometimes is either there's no market or you have a falling out with the early team. Those are like a common causes of a startup stagnation or failure. So the other reason, I'm going to walk you through some of the arguments in favor of culture. I'll know that all the time in cowers you spend in product is good time and energy because the better the product is, the easier it is to track users and customers. Not counter-intuitive at all that makes sense. I'm going to posit that there's a direct analogy around culture. The better your culture is, the easier it will be for you to track co-founders and employees, eventually customers, investors and other things. It actually matters. This is going to sound cliched in platitude, no, because it's cliched in platitude, no. But the overall purpose of a culture, the idea behind it is to attract amazing people and help them do their best work. That's why you have it. That's why you should have a good one versus a crappy one. The other one is like, in this I've seen happens so many times. So bad crappy culture and their multiple toxic cultures will not likely kill you immediately. It's not the fastest way to die. There are much faster ways to kill a startup. This is the most reliable. It will kill you. If the culture is crappy, it's just a matter of time. It will not. Can't last. And then this is for the economically and mathematically oriented. There is relatively convincing evidence that's one slide around. This is a comparison of the S&P 500 based on the survey of the happiness of the employees at those companies and their overall performance on the public markets. So it's like, okay, so culture sort of matters. At least there's the correlation. We may not be able to draw direct causality, but there's a correlation between companies with happy employees tend to do better performance wise on the market. All right, so having said all that, HubSpot in our first three years were about nine something years old now. We did not use the word culture at all. And I know this because neither my co-founder, we don't have phone calls. I don't have phone calls generally at all as it turns out. I'm quirky that way. So everything we've ever said to each other has been in late night emails from 11 p.m. to about 2 a.m. because we have these long thousand word emails that go back and forth. So I look back to the archives like, oh, when did we first start talking about culture it was three years in. So we didn't do it. And then this happens. So what a my co-founder of the CEO of HubSpot went to a CEO group, which is the easiest way to think about as a group therapy for CEOs. So they all go in and they can kind of talk about issues of the day, which is super useful. I highly recommend it. And so at this particular session that he went to, the theme was culture. And we're still in our kind of early stages. And so he has, I guess I can't think of reveal the names anyway, but he had some high fluten CEOs in his group. And Brian's reaction, my co-founder is like, well, culture, he had that last excuse. He was like, we don't have time for that. We're trying to build this business. We're building a product. We're trying to get customers. We're doing all these things. Who has time for culture? And they beat him up over it. They're like, no, you do not understand. Your job as a CEO. This is like, this cannot be any higher on the priority list. It should be number one. You should do it. And so Brian, not his head, got through that meeting. Then the next meeting that I had with him over beers. He's like, darn mesh, I've heard this culture thing is really, really important. Why don't you go do that? Now that presented a problem because on the introvert scale, I'm way over there. It's like way over there. And so it's not that I don't like humans. There are some that I do hanging around with. That's my wife and child. The gratuitous photo of the children. And so then it's like, OK, Brian's busy. He's doing other things. All he's really asking me to do is what I thought my mission was going to be was, OK, well, we have a culture. I just need to collect some data and ask our employees what culture is, what they think about it to be. It's a data collection, kind of like write down and be the scribe for the culture that already exists. Like, not pleasant, I'd rather be writing code, but OK, fine. I'll take one for the team. And within days, this is my reaction. It's like, this is the worst possible thing I've ever done to myself in the history of me. It was so bad. It was bad on so many levels. It was crazy. I'll give you one anecdote. So I started sending emails around and it's like, by the way, I'm working on this thing. I'm trying to figure out culture at the company. And then I got these like flaming responses. And I'm used to flaming responses from the HubSpot employees telling me I'm going to get for many different reasons. But this one was particularly acute and hard to take. They're like, oh, so now we're talking about culture. Next is going to be like posters on the wall. And it's the first step down the slippery slope. And then this is the one that killed me. It's like, this is not the company that I thought I joined. It's like, you're killing me here. What? All they asked you was, are you happy or not? What do you think? It's like, wow. And people have this very visceral reaction when you start talking about people's issues and culture. And so I sent this email. This is unedited. I'm directly to my co-founder, which I'm going to paraphrase and say, well, I'll read it. Not sure I wound up being the guy who lead the discussion on culture, but it's freaking hard. Eventually, we need to give this to someone that actually likes humans. This is a late night email. About two or three months after that original kind of interaction. So I didn't drop it. I'm like, OK, let's get back to the thing, whatever will work through these issues, whatever I do think it's important. I was going off and reading on what other people do. And it turns out the data suggests that we did a survey. And as the employees, are you happy or not? Would you recommend PubSpiles of Place to Work? On a scale of zero 10? And the reality was, good, which is, oh, they were super happy, ecstatically happy, maniacally happy. That was a good news. The second question we asked is, OK, well, why did you give us that score? And when we had this kind of recursion problem, the reason the people at HubSpot were happy was because of the other people at HubSpot. It's like, well, I don't know what to do with that, which is, OK, well, start with happy people and don't lose them, I guess. And then they will attract more people that will also be happy. So this was a challenge. We worked through this. So this is actually this is the last braggie slide I forgot I had this one in there. So Glassdoor does this kind of nationwide survey of employees, anonymous, like the Yelp for how many people have heard of Glassdoor? I'm just curious. OK, I'll just let all of you. All right, so they do this thing. And unsurprisingly, last year, Google is number one. You've Facebook, and I just pulled out the tech companies, folks that you would know. And this is one of the things we're most proud of. This is this year's scores. So we came in at number four. I'm going to talk you through. Yeah, it's like what happened in the language story. So that's the last braggie slide. And so the approach we took in terms of culture is we took the kind of engineering very geeked out way of thinking about it, which is, OK, well, culture, what it really is, the way I think about it, it's like the operating system that everything else is kind of running on. It's like the hardest, the machinery that makes us run. And we should kind of build it as such. And so I subsequently spent hundreds of hours. This is like the floor. I know it's bigger than this. This is all I'm willing to admit to. And the real pain was the fact that those 300 hours were not spent writing Python code. They were spent writing a PowerPoint deck trying to describe culture at HubSpot. We thought it was, but we think it needed to be. And resulted in this deck called HubSpot Culture Code. And we made the, we're decision about a couple of years after we kind of started that process. It's like, oh, well, this is useful. Like in the kind of open source mentality, we have this very kind of transparent culture. It's like, yeah, we'll put it out there to see if this is useful to other people. And it's been wildly popular for reasons that are not completely clear. I think it's because of topics on people's minds. So that's done well. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to talk you through some of the kind of mechanics of how we came up with the stuff we came up with. And some of the things that I think are useful. This is not to tell you about HubSpot Culture and what it's like. It's to tell you about the thought process that went into some of the things that I think are generally, generally good. So the first thing we kind of recognized, our first kind of observation was that all of us, humanity overall and people that work for companies and startups all over had kind of dramatically changed how they live and work. So in the left corner of the things that people used to care about, that was their thing. And the right column is the way they are now. And most of you will have, especially the under-generational nodger heads. Yeah, I can't believe what's that pension. Like what is that? And it's inconceivable to any of us that we're going to spend entire career. People did this by the way back in the day. They spent their entire professional career in one company. And that was the thing that you did. And Laos was like, whatever. I'm not, no, I'm not staying here. I'm definitely not anyway. And so our reaction was like, okay, well, it looks like a lot of these companies are essentially frozen in time. They've got this thing that they're doing that makes no sense for the current reality in terms of the people that are working there. People they want to attract just doesn't make any sense. So we went out to fix that. And this starts with the culture code kind of described. So here's what's broken. Here's how we think I'm not going to bore you with this stuff. And this is going to sound patchy. I'm going to skip by this actually, even though it's like the most important sign of the deck, but I'll put it up there for a little while. This one is, it's Kruche, I love this quote. And the idea here is most of the dysfunctions that exist in a startup or a company of any size, most of them happen in dark corners behind closed doors. Or is it when the stupidest stuff happens? And if you can shine light into those things that are happening right now, the likelihood of stupidity, just flat out stupidity goes down. So if there's like two people trying to make a decision, it's like, okay, we're going to go just talk through whoever. And then we will reveal to the employees what we came up with. You are much more likely to make very stupid decisions in those circumstances. So the more light you can shine into the process, overall, the better the outcome by the decision. As a result of that, we made the decision early on in the company to share just about everything with everyone. Period. Only different, only exceptions, were if we were legally bound not to share it, like if we were working on some M&A transaction, where we had a contractual obligation not to share it. Or, and we can talk about this in the Q&A if you're curious, individual compensation data. Because it was data that we felt like we didn't exclusively own as the company. It was kind of a shared data thing between the individual and us. Everything else, the board deck, the financial, how much money we burned, when we were going to run out of cash, what the overall valuations were, what discussions we were having with VCs, everything was shared with everyone. And that worked out well. The other thing we did, I'll just give you this quick hack. So we have this very open culture. Lots of people do that. Something that a lot of people don't do, I'll give you the anecdote here. So we start off just my co-founder, I went in this room with four desks. Common startup environment. Actually, that's probably, we were living luxurious because there's like two desks that are open. That was amazing. And so then we hired the first employees, like, okay, well, where should that person sit? And it seemed unfair, originally. It's like, okay, well, why should we have just because we happen to be here? So what we did is we had this hack. It's like, okay, what we'll do is we'll do a random lottery. And we'll pick desks. And we did it because we're geeked out. We're like, okay, well, it's not late. Whoever gets it gets the window seat because that's, you know, because not everybody wants the window seat. So as your turn came up in the lottery, you got to pick whichever the open desk were left. Essentially very, very simple, simple hack. And then what we did was like, okay, well, every time we hire someone, we're going to go reshuffle desks. We're going to go through a lottery process again. So employee number four, employee number 10, employee number 50, employee number eight. And all along the way, people told us, well, that's just crazy. Like, yeah, it worked at 10 people. Maybe 50, I don't know how you do it. 200 people, 400 people, and we kept going. And if I think back on it now, in terms of like simple hacks, can you imagine the countless hours that has saved just from raw office politics? Now, a lot of you are young. And so you haven't had the mind numbing experience of like arguing over like one inch of like office space. Like, wait a second, Susie has a better thing than I do. Or like, we avoided all of that, right? Trying to think through all that. Just that one simple hack. So the moral of the story, by the way, there is get the simple hacks in early as much hard to make those kinds of changes later. The other one that's interesting. So we have this kind of hyper transparent culture of share everything. And this is something we had to add later in the deck because there was much confusion around it. I thought we were transparent, but then this decision get made. And I don't remember being asked for like a vote. It's like, well, no, transparency means we will tell you how the process works, what's going into it. But someone owns that decision. We do not make decisions by consensus. Someone owns it. And we trust them to make the right decision. So transparency is not the same thing as democracy. This one. Another hack. So as we were growing, it's like, okay, well, we have to like do things and have some guidelines around sick time and vacations and stuff like that. And we didn't have that as we were growing. And it's like our chief console and our CFO said, okay, well, now is the time to start writing down like get an employee manual together and put all this stuff together. We need guidelines. And we said, we don't want to do that. Is it legally required? Well, no, not technically. It's not legally required. But we should have. So we made exactly three words as our policy for everything unless otherwise stated, which is a use of judgment. Should I buy a round of drinks, I'm at this event. It's really snowing. I know you guys don't experience this, but it's really snowing hard outside. Should I come into the office to kind of stay home and work from home? We don't care. We don't care, but we don't care in terms of what decision you make. I'm going to skip through this in the interest of time. Let data make. It's the geeked out. Most of the engineering folks in here will appreciate this. Don't use rank, essentially. I'm going to try and get to the QA. I'm trying to spitting through this because I'm sensing, yeah, we should be going to QA. I'm going to walk you through some of the landmines. This is like the first thing they teach you when you're doing like a public present, like when I'm reading a book, I would do not end on a dark note. So I'm going to end on a dark note. Is first thing you learn, this I kind of hinted at this in the beginning parts, is that like the immediate reactions, like, okay, well, the first rule of cultures you do not talk about culture, right? That was the immediate reaction I got from the employee base. Like I've learned since then, is in order for it to work, you have to talk about it incessantly. Like, insetly, you have to keep like, this is what it is. Because as you're growing, you think that like, oh, well, everybody kind of gets this. Like, we've been around like, no, they don't. I guarantee you they don't get it. And as you're kind of adding new people, so you have to keep talking about it. First decide what it is, and then communicate it constantly. The other one, this is back to software. Like, some people is like, okay, well, these are our values, and this is what it is, and this is the way it's going to be because our founders said so 20 years ago or whatever it is. That doesn't work. Cultures more like software than hardware, let's say, gets from a parallel perspective. You should be entering on it and building it just like you would a product. So our culture code deck is in version 37 of the ones that we publicly published, right? So we keep going back and say, oh, well, this is quite, not quite right. We find bugs in it. We have a backlog of requests and change requests and things like that. Someday, I want to put it into GitHub and do that, but it's, so we have to get that out yet. Anyway, so this is the other dark one. This is probably the biggest reason you should invest some time in deciding what your culture is. Those that are engineering understand the notion of technology debt. So technology debt is you take this shortcut, you hack something together, and you put it out there because in the interest of time you just want to get it out there, and you know that was hacky code, and you're going to have to go fix it someday and pay off the debt, similar to financial debt. I need to cash now, and I'm willing to pay it some interest rate and pay it off in the future because the cash right now is necessary. Same thing with technology debt, and there is such a thing as culture debt. And culture debt is, yeah, this person is sort of a jerk, but they're so good. And we've been recruiting, we're trying to find this designer for like two and a half months. They're the best one we've seen so far, and we have no idea when the next one's going to come along that we really like. But I really want to be around them, and then you'll rationalize like, oh yeah, but though just work remotely, it'll be fine. It's usually not fine. What ends up happening is that they make everybody around them miserable. Everybody that comes in interviews with the company, if that interacts with that person, it's like, okay, well, this is, I don't want to work for this company. They won't tell you that, right? Because they're interviewing. And the funny thing is about, when you need to encourage technology debt, you can go back and say, you know what, I wrote this hacky code, it's really slow or really buggy or something's happening. I am going to pay this debt off, I'm going to rewrite this, it's going to be beautiful, I'm going to refactor the code, it's going to be awesome. Culture debt, you might do the same thing, like the parallel would be like, oh, we're going to, we discover this person's a jerk, we're going to let them go. Right? Now the difference is that, when you refactor that code, you basically paid off your debt. When you fire that person that was a jerk, you haven't completely paid off the debt, because the things that they, like the plant, mines the people there, it's like, you're still kind of be rooting out and you will never know whether you completely got rid of some of the toxicity they left behind. It's amazing how much impact, especially in an early team that can have. So be very, very careful. And it's easy for me to say, right? And it's, but it's so tempting, like it's just okay, we just need this person, we'll figure out later it will be okay. It won't, as it turns out, it'll be okay, but it'll be painful. It's not worth it. The other one, that's interesting. So when we came out with the early iterations of the culture code deck, and how spots culture, we're like, okay, we've got it, we've gotten all the feedback, this is what our culture is, awesome, like our work is done here. And then, like the engineers will come back, it's like, well, Darmesh, I know the culture code says, like, oh, we believe anyone can work from anywhere. That's what it says in the deck, that's our philosophy, like we don't believe in specific office locations, whatever, we like the freedom of working from anywhere. And our VP of engineering comes along and says, well, I don't like that. Like we think we do much better work when we're co-located, as an example. So what is happening is that you have this, what I think of is like the federal versus state issue. So the issue here is you're going to have what you will think of as like kind of federal law. Like these are the things that are in violet, right? So we think of it as like the inelial rights of a hubspired. Like we will not take transparency away. And no one can decide that you don't get access to the financials. Those are some things that we hold in violet, we won't change it. But then there are certain things like, okay, well, this is our overall philosophy. But if an individual group disagrees with that particular structure, that particular guideline, they're welcome to override as long as they can kind of convince their team and if it's the right thing to do. So that's, and that always shows up anytime you have more than two people, or one person with a dual personality, there's always these kind of subcultures that develop in a group. So everyone wants to hire for culture fit. This is a last dark slide and then I'm going to end in a happy note. So I'm going to go on a very, very short rant, but it's an important one. I talk to entrepreneurs and people all the time that says we hire for culture fit. Like we hire for culture and then my question is that awesome that you hire for culture fit. What's your culture? Just like describing them, I'm not like trying to be aggressive. I'm not a confrontational guy, but like what is it? I'm curious. And if you can't tell me what your culture is, that means when you say we hire for culture fit, that means you hire people just like yourself. And you're using culture as a shorthand for being able to hire people just like yourself. So you should not be allowed to say that we hire for culture fit unless you can tell people what that culture is. Otherwise, you have these kind of all sorts of biases that kick in, and that's a very, very dangerous thing. So this is one of the most important reasons to write your culture down. It doesn't have to be 128 slide PowerPoint deck like we have, but it should be written down, even if it's an email. Like it's something has to exist that people have access to so they know what it is. And then a closing note is every company, however many people, is going to have a culture. Cultures exist period. Any time more than one person is together. And with a few, I'm not suggesting you go off and spend hundreds of hours, but every hour, five hours, ten hours you spend in those early days, have dramatic leverage. So might as well build a culture you're going to love and build a company you want to work for and work in. So thank you, and I will take questions. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. I was wondering if you had anyone that acted as a mentor to you, and if so, and what was the day that you? Yeah. I haven't had an official... Question with the computer. Oh, sorry. Yes. Questions. Have I ever had a mentor that kind of guided me and kind of helped you through the process? The answer is no. No official mentor. I think that not that I wouldn't have wanted one or I didn't think it would be useful. I don't have the personality because I'm not going to reach out to some random person. It's like, oh, can you be my mentor? It feels a little bit awkward to me. That was stupid of me, honestly, because it would have been useful. But I've read a lot. So I feel like I know people that are in the community. And I've gotten better about it now. So now I will kind of reach out to someone in my peer group. I think that the company is going through some more issues and I'll have like random dinners with them. There's no official mentor relationship. But I strongly advise that I've known people that have mentors. And most of them swear by them that there's like, it's an awesome thing. So we'll go here and then we'll go around here. So in most organizations, I've seen that the culture seems... It has to be the top most level. What would you do if you were in an organization where the leadership does not want to focus on culture? But they need to. Okay, so the question is, often culture needs to come down from the top and kind of define the culture. And what do you do in an organization where leadership is not bought into that kind of process? So a couple of things. One is, cultures correctly done. The only way, real way they stick is, it has to be a collaborative process with the team. If I had tried, which I sort of did, and the early... It's like, okay, well, here's what I think. Culture should be. I have run a lot. I know things. I've been around the company a bunch. You get... Revolt and people just don't buy it. So it doesn't work. So that's number one is, cultures can't be created by E-Dick. It has to be through this kind of collaborative process that ideally would be transparent. Now, then the question is around, okay, well, what if... The leadership of the company just doesn't value culture? Send them a link to this video. And I'll help make the pitch. But it's hard. You have to kind of... Help them recognize the importance of it. Maybe introduce them either to some material or some person's kind of live through it. Because most people that have been kind of been through the process in both directions, no one will argue. No one I know has ever argued. It's like, well, darn mesh. You know, we spend a little bit... That whole culture thing. That was highly overrated. Not once have I heard that. Not once. So, yes, we'll go here and then we'll go back. Yes. What kind of questions do you ask to... When you're hiring people to determine how to... So, what kind of questions do I ask in order to determine culture fit? So, we have this kind of set of five attributes that we saw for. And it's... Yeah. And one of them is humility. It's like number one. It's like... Yeah. Humility and effectiveness and transparency. And there's a bunch of them. And so, what we do is we ask questions that are geared around all five of the attributes, essentially. And so, we have a separate kind of set of questions. So, we have the things that test for skill set. Do you know the things that you need to do to do this job? But then the other ones around we try to whittle out is someone humble or not. Like it's... As it turns out, I don't even need to interview someone in order to figure that out. I have a very, very high, highly sensitized, wealthy, accurate arrogance detector. I can... Literally, I can tell in like three sentence email whether someone... Where they kind of generally fall on the humility versus arrogance and ego scale. So, what we do is that we... And every person at interviews that have a spot has a different thing in terms of how they... We'd have the things, but every hire and every promotion, we rate the people on their... How they fit the culture. Essentially, like, okay, was this person humble... Not just when they get hired, but every point. So, if you are a non-humble, let's say you snuck in somehow because you kind of faked it. I don't know how you do that, but let's say you did. You... We'll get caught eventually because every promotion, every review process, we stick... Okay, well, on a scale of zero to ten, was this person transparent? Do you think of this person as being transparent? Yeah, we're a little bit... Draconian about, I guess, is probably the best word. I'm going to go here and then I'll come back. Yeah, yes? I have a kind of extension of a former question. Who owns the 120-page PowerPoint deck? You're talking about, like, it's collaborative, but you're also set that the decision is... ...darkened by consensus, is it yours at the head of HR? Great question. So, it's exactly 128 slides, by the way. In case you were curious, it's always been 100... Well, not for years it has been. Every time I add a slide, I take a slide away. So, it's exactly that way it puts a constraint on. And I own it in terms of being described for the deck. So, it's the kind of benevolent dictator for life and open source world kind of things. So, I take contributions. I'll take, essentially, the equivalent of a pull request. And then I'll weave it in, and I'll put it out there for comment. And then RFC form within the company. It's like, okay, here's what the next version of the deck looks like. What do you think? Often, I get flamed. But then I kind of weigh that back as far as I... Okay, well, this is still overall, even though... So, it's not done by vote. But anyway, I own it. So, every change that's made every word on every slide... I own, yeah. Yes. So, you mentioned that transparency is one of the biggest advantages in the company. So, are there any challenges associated with having such a transparent culture? Yeah, there are challenges. There are questions. You know, transparent is such a big part of the culture. Are there any challenges or downsides? There are challenges, but there... Most people overweight the danger involved, the risk involved in being hyper-transparent. So, when we started doing this, right? When we were... First of all, I'm going to tell you the hack, because it's an interesting one. When we hired our first employee. So, first, it was just my co-founder and I, you know, hired the third person coming into the team. One of the decisions we have to make is, like, okay, well, what do we tell this person? Like, that was like a decision we have to make. And my co-founder looked at each other and was like, well, the easiest path is like... Like, everything. Right? It was like, that's an easy, easy binary kind of choice. And so then we just kept doing that. And then as we grew, our board, our advisors, people, it's like, okay, well... Yeah, that's fine right now. But what happens when you guys are out raising a funding round, and they can see the cash balance kind of depleting, and they know you've been on the road for five weeks, and it's like the cash is going around, or like, what happens then? And as it turns out, nothing. It's like, even though it's gone for those dark periods, and the funny thing is, so... So yes, there's risk involved, but when's up happening? When you have a hyper-transparent culture, when you know what the rules are, so we have this hyper-transparent culture, you end up hiring people. They're way unlikely to take advantage or abuse that trust. Right? Because like, okay, well, if we didn't have that transfer, like, we can hire people, it's like, okay, well, is this someone that we feel like we can like reveal our financials so that we can tell this, will they use this against us? Will they... And in nine and a half years, we have 1100 employees in the company. And we have never had a breach of trust. And it says, it's crazy. We've had lots of people, and we grow fast. We've had people leave. So... I would still highly recommend doing it. Yes, there are challenges, but the upside is immense. Number one is, as a society, we value transparency a lot, especially like early stage, especially in startup land. I was going to run this diabolical experiment at HubSpot, and I used the word diabolical because that's the word to use. That's what it is. I was going to go ask people when they were hired. It's like, okay, we have this thing, we have this very transparent culture. Here's this kind of server that we have this wiki, that we have all these documents and all this information. You can have access to that, or you can get 10% more in comp, if you just don't care about that. That was... It's like, okay, what's the actual economic value that people would place on the access to information? Like, do you really want that badly? I didn't run the experiment. My thesis is, if we had run the experiment, just what everyone would have said, I want access to the information. Because it gives you a level of security that you know what's going on. Not that you need to contribute to every decision. But once again, it's like, okay, well, in startup land, it's a very crazy thing. This is one of the things when you're recruiting, which is going to do, when you start building the company. You're convincing the overall goal of an early stage startup is to convince exceptionally smart people to do this very stupid thing, which is joining you in this kind of crazy thing that doesn't make any sense. If you objectively looked at it, it's like, why would they do that? What transparency allows you to do is at least make some convincing arguments like, okay, if this is completely great, at least you'll know what's going on. And it gives you lots of leverage in terms of recruiting and things like that. So, I think we had a question here, and yes, then I'll go back this way. So, back to the example of the individual with the fabulous skills set, who's a jerk. I think you sort of put out there the binary decision to keep them in and encourage the culture set or get rid of them. And I'm wondering whether the middle ground of maybe working with them to help them to, you know, somehow other incorporated or associated culture in a way that... And if that says jerks, because it's just like they're in their heads and they just come off that way. And in my mind, the discriminating factor, what makes one jerk and the other one not really, is what they're solving for. There are people that are like, I'm a little bit this way. I'm super analytical and I will question everything. And that's just like an academic in me a little bit. But I like to see them think of myself as not a jerk. So, the difference is, are they being jerky just to be little someone else? Are they doing it out of their own ego? Or are they just doing it because that's just their way of getting inputs or something like that. It's in their nature, but they're still solving for the greater good. So, we have people that are skeptics, and this is one. This is actually a really good one. The dynamics, and there are skeptics. The little definition for a cynic is not only that they don't believe, like good thing is happening, and they're cynical, they don't believe good is possible. That's the little, like, distinction of skeptic is skeptical. But they will say, oh, I'm kind of skeptical of this particular decision. But the reason they're expressing that skepticism is because they believe they have the hope that it'll get better, and that's why they're sharing it. Synics are different. Jerks, similar kind of parallel, which is, some jerks are just doing it to be little people, because that's how they think they kind of raise their own value. It's hard to tell sometimes, but yeah, that's the distinction. Hold on, I'm going to go. Wait, that person had to hand up earlier. I don't know how I know that, but okay. So my question is really, you know, looking at the list in terms of companies that people really enjoy looking at, most of them seem to be successful companies that they're doing very well. How often things don't go well, but they're layoffs going on, and you have one gauge of kids, you have a lot of stress in your life. You can really tend to, you know, kind of develop different activities and personalities and things like that. What's your experience in dealing with those sort of situations? Because that's when you really need culture. That's when you really need people to come together, because you get out of that situation. Good question. So the question is successful companies tend to show up on those kind of happy employees list because they have the resources they can kind of do the things that are necessary. How do you do that when resources are limited, when going through dark times, possible layoffs? And my answer to this is like, real culture is not about, you know, ping pong tables and beer Fridays and things like that. It's about these kind of core, kind of first principles kind of stuff. And my experience, what's happened, this is, how's about my third startup, right? And I've lived through layoffs, I've lived through company shutdowns, I've lived through a lot of different things. And one thing that I've realized is that when you have the right people on board and you're transparent with them, they will cut you a lot of slack. Like I've had people volunteer to take pay cuts because like, to our mesh, I know we're not going to be able to meet payroll. I love this company, I love what we're doing. You know, I'll go to 50% salary. And that happens. Like people are willing to live through the pain as long as you're honest with them. The issue turns up is when you're going through dark times and this misguided notion of protecting the team from the reality that, and that's the rationalization entrepreneur sometimes use, and it's not malintent, they're like, oh, well, and it's part of my job to buffer the team from this darkness that's happening over here, right? And you have to be careful with that because you don't want to just lay everything out there out of your own kind of, oh, I just need to kind of share this misery or something. I've got a needs to be from a greater group of company and for that individual. It's like, okay, this is something they should know. I know it's tough, but here's what we're going through. And that's the true test of a culture is like if you have that in place. And it's so interesting. So every quarter for the last six plus years, every three months we do an employee survey to all employees across the entire company that asked the exact same question I asked in the first one, which is based on a skill of 010, how likely are you to recommend HubSpot as a place to work? And we've been taking that data in every month for six plus years. And that is, in our minds, like the leading indicator of how the company is actually doing. I can look at the financials, but if there's a problem, that's the scenario in the coal mine. It's like, okay, we'll see that, and now we kind of slice it a little bit by group and be a geography. We have multiple offices. It's like, okay, well, there's something wrong in the sales group because you can see it. It's like, okay, there's something wrong with leadership. So usually what it is, something's going on. And so what's interesting is that when we've had our dark times, and we've had them, our NPS goes up. Employees are happier. One of the darker times, it wasn't dark because it went poorly. When we went public, that was the thing the employees were most worried about. It's like, okay, well, when companies go public, this happens because they're going to stop sharing information with us because now they're a publicly traded company. They can't do those kinds of things. Our overall happiness, as measured kind of objectively, that we've been doing for years, went up post IPO. Then before, it's like, we talked about it, we came through it. Put a couple of interesting hacks in place. One of which I am a big hack guy, so I'm going to tell you this, because I forgot to tell you earlier. In the process of going this is, I'm going to tell you anyway because it's fun. So when we are going public, so you have this hyper transparent culture, share all the financials with everybody, put it all out. They're all, you know, all thousand employees. And then our legal counsel on the bankers come back. It's like, okay, well, now that you're going public, what you need to do is you need to figure out this kind of group of insiders. And there will be regulations around them in terms of when they can trade stock and all these things. And it's like, you just need to pick who your list is. It's going to be your CFO or whatever. And it's like, do I measure if you want to be on that list? That's completely fine. Whatever, okay. And then my co-founder and I pause. It's like, okay, well, it's like, okay, well, what's the regulation? How many of them can we have? They're trying to figure out who should we lead. And so they come back and say, well, there's no limit, not only, but usually 6, 8, 10. So we made every single employee a designated insider, every single one. And our chief counsel thought we were, it has been done before. We didn't know this at the time. But it's like, okay, well, that's stupid. Don't assume rules that are in place. It's like, is that the kind of stuff that I think gives people confidence that just because we've been public, we're not going to go down and crashing burning flames? Which may anyway, but hopefully won't be because of stupid reasons like that. Yes? So if you mentioned that your co-founder went to like a CEO, found a legal discussion, that that was the impetus for the poor, that started the folks' comments. Can you comment in terms of your own personal growth, professional growth, the trends of your journey of thought? Have you, yourself, found coaches or mentored your own sort of like CEO, round people in the specialist issues? Yep. You've got a very visceral, greedy sense of how it all works now. It's clear that you've digested these two subtle layers. Yeah, so the question is around, you know, so the CEO went to this kind of CEO group. Questions, do I go, have I been to those kind of group things or whatever? Not formal ones that exist. I think I've been doing though, but I've been doing it for 15 plus years now. I do these informal dinners with people that kind, I know, I've met online or I've known, and some people I know, some people I don't know, every city I travel into, I'll do these kind of random ad hoc dinners. And I have a couple of hacks, as you might expect, for these dinners. One is I never plan them in advance. I send the email the day of and say, oh, by the way, I'm in town. My schedules changed. Are you open for dinner? Question number two is, do you know anyone else that you've been wanting to meet? Or you think I should meet, and we'll have dinners from anywhere from two people to 30 people, any given thing? And the overall, and I don't label it as this, but it's what I call, and I've done this now, semi-efficiently, I call it the founder therapy dinner. Right? And this is super important. And as I was going through it, and I try to get round tables, instead of square tables, there's a bunch of weirdness that goes into how I pick venues and stuff. I sound for acoustics, because you want to have a conversation. And it's funny, because what ends up happening is that the same dynamics that exist in group therapy, actually apply here. And 50% of the problem that founders go through, which is a 50% of the problem that any kind of issue you're dealing with, is this kind of belief that you're alone. Like, I am the only one living this thing, whatever, there's something wrong with me, and that's why I'm having these problems. If I were a better founder, I would not be having these issues. And I have found overwhelming evidence that all founders have almost the same issues, same issues. Most of them are people issues, that it turns out. But they have the issues. And maybe they may be time shifted, and based on stage, they either live them, but they're living something. I have not met a single founder, including ones that are multi-billion dollar companies now, that says, oh yeah, it was a really tough ride, those first three or four years. But boy, is it easy now? Like I don't have any, like, doesn't happen, right? So I strongly encourage you as you're going through this, because a, find a co-founder, or multiple co-founders, because startup life is super lonely, super super lonely. And if you misguidely don't get a co-founder, find a peer group that you can kind of talk to on a regular basis, and kind of vent and share, and kind of live the journey, at least with someone else. Yes? So usually you'll find that most public companies, when they put out their financial statements, will adjust some things around to kind of make the company look good. Yeah. When it's really too much still confidence in investing in the market, do you find that with having such transparency, particularly with our two financials, that that has the absolute effect with you that it occurs maybe to start price with your investment? May, so I'll tell you our stance, and we can determine the market, we'll determine whether it hurts us, or helps us, I think it helps us, and we've been using it on the road show. So we've had these metrics inside the company for all of our entire history. So when we went on the road show, we didn't redefine things like lifetime value and cack in the financials that, you know, SaaS companies or tech companies often report. And we said, okay, well here are the financials we've been using, literally the financials we've been using to run the business for the last, you know, seven years. And we didn't change a darn thing, right? And so then it was much easier for us to answer the questions, or whatever. And yes, it did not put us in as positive a light as it might have, but the street appreciated the transparency. They got it. And we've been fortunate, it's been, you know, it's only about a little over a year in, four public quarters, and they've been positive financially, they've hit the metrics and things like that. That helps, obviously, but yeah, this is it. So here, and then we'll go back. I'm curious, I noticed your CEO and co-founder wrote a book on marketing lessons learned from the grateful debt. And the openness of your culture and transparency connected with financial success seems to parallel that. And here's one of the lessons you might have learned or built on from the grateful debt. You mentioned the road show just now. Can you bring culture into the grateful debt a little bit more explicitly in the focus here? Wow, okay. So the question is, my co-founder, Brian Haligan, he's a big, he's a big deadhead, big found the grateful debt. He wrote a book on marketing lessons from the grateful debt. And the question is, can we apply, like lessons from the grateful debt to culture? And the answer is, I personally cannot, because I am not a deadhead, but I will tell you, in terms of the overall, the business of HubSpot, the entire reason the company exists, the overall idea, which I didn't talk about, but I did not pay this person to give me a reason to at least tell you a little bit about HubSpot. Is we created this thing called inbound marketing. And the thesis is that people hate being marketed to. We hate being cold-called, we hate spam, we hate junk mail, all those things. And HubSpots overall approach was to kind of change marketing to make it more empathetic, and more open. It's like, here's what we're doing. This is why, and openly, you know, publisher pricing, don't hide customer views, like all these positive things that lots of companies just weren't doing. So our thesis is that, in the long run, especially with the connectedness that we have in the world, transparency trumps opaqueness in the long-term period. Like, and whether it's culture, whether it's what you're selling, it's marketing, it's whatever it is, and I know I'm going to be right. The only question is the time horizon, right? It's like, okay, well, I'm going to be right about some things on transparency, always trumping opaqueness, but like, people just have access to so much information. Now, you cannot get away with the crap you used to get away with before, and that's why companies did it because they could. I just don't, not only do I think it's the right thing to do, I think it's the optimum thing to do. Yes? So you open, seeing up all of these last quarter, you play the open office, and I feel, you can see it. So my question is, when we probably build transparency and cultural, yep. What are the major problems? Good question. So the fight with the, you know, HubSpot has offices in Sydney, Dublin, Singapore, we're opening an office in Japan, and how does this translate? How does our culture translate across borders and things like that? I'll give you a slightly long answer because I think it's an important one. Of all the decisions we've made at HubSpot, one of the toughest ones, when we first opened our remote office in Dublin, right? And the reason is we were scared to death, because our culture is, we realized we had no offices for the first six years or so. Okay, we're going to open this office in Dublin. We have no freaking idea how to take this magic that's working here and transpose it over to Dublin. We don't know how to do that. We don't have that muscle group. I know other companies have done it and done it. Well, we know it's possible, but we haven't done this. We were scared to death. And so we ended up doing, we made a couple of decisions. I'm going to share the one with you that has been the most impactful in terms of increasing the odds of success. And it's going very well. When we went into Dublin, we didn't do it for this reason, but Dublin had a depressed economy for what Ireland did overall, leading up to that. And there were great tech companies in Dublin, but they did what most companies do when they go out, so I thought, we're going to send our crappy projects there. We're going to go there for because the labor's cheaper for whatever reasons or whatever. And we didn't do that. We did the exact opposite, which is okay. Here are the rights that every HubSpotter has. These are HubSpotters, therefore they have these rights. So when we went into Europe, it's like, okay, so we have unlimited vacation. And people told us, they meant it facetiously, it's like, well, you can't have unlimited vacation in Europe. They will never show up for work. Like that was, and as it turns out, that's not true. And so we do do that. You still have a document or some laws around having a minimum thing or whatever. And so we did, we said, okay, we're going to take all the things that make HubSpot HubSpot and we're going to try not to change the things simply because it's possible for us to do that or get away with it essentially. We've tried to, and that's helped. We've done a bunch of other things in terms of bringing people back here and trying to infuse it. But it's one of the things, on my list of things that keep me up at night, is how do we take the thing that's working right now? It's like, yeah, I don't want any dark note. I'm going to, I'll take one last question. We'll go away in the back here. And then, when you look at that culture code, and companies download that, accept it, what kind of success do you see in what challenges do they have, typically? I don't know if they give you that feedback. Yeah, so it's interesting. Hi, David. I've seen him in eight years. He was employee number three in my first startup. So the question is, how do we get, okay, so one of the things I did, this is relatively recent. At the end of the culture code deck, there's an email address, and it's culturecoderhubspot.com. And I invite people to, the deck invites people to provide commentary and feedback, good or bad. And I read every one of those emails, every single one, respond to probably 95% of them. The only ones I don't respond to are the ones that are self-promotional and spammy, trying to pitch me something. And the interesting thing is, how universal some of these ideas are. And I will forward some of them to the team because I think they're very, very cool. People from all walks of life, and they're not even in tech. They're not in startups, they're just working for some manufacturing firm in Boise, Idaho, or something. And they're like, I read the culture code deck, and I was like nodding the whole way through. I've had emails like, this thing made me cry, that kind of stuff. And it's very gratifying to kind of see that even though we're geeked out on techie and weird and sitting out in Boston in our own bubble, these concepts seem to resonate with people, and that's very gratifying. And I haven't gotten any, which is surprising for the internet, like no hate mail. And no one's like, oh, well, you're obviously doing this and this and this and the other thing, just to take advantage of employees, and you're going to try and put off deferred comp or something. I don't know what it is, but I've not gotten any, which is I've probably jinxed myself. Thanks for your time. This has been a lot of fun. Yeah. Thank you.
