 You are listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. It is my pleasure today to introduce our fabulous guests. We have the founding team of Kulairis here. I want to introduce, starting on my left with Sujanya Bumkar, who is the CEO of the company. He has started several high tech companies before, and the most notable of which was, well, how can you, what did you? Well, Vasu and Tamarind, I would say, were pretty successful. Okay, great. So he started several companies. I'm sure we'll hear something about that. We have Austin Schumaker, who graduated from Stanford in 2005. And you're not going to believe it. Look at him. He doesn't look that old, but he also spent seven years at Apple. I think he was the youngest intern that was ever there, starting when he was 15. And in fact, I think he sold his first company when he was 13 years old. What's up? There are other people. There are other people in the box that I suggest you. Okay, well, we won't give you all the credit. But it's pretty impressive anyway. And then we've got Josh Schwartz-Apelle, who also was a navel fellow. So I've got to know him quite well over the last few years. And he is also on the founding team. And graduate from Stanford a year and a half ago. And was on the Stanford Men's volleyball team. So we're going to hear all about this. And let's get started. I have one confession to make. I am a huge fan of Cool Virus. I am such a fan of Cool Virus that whenever I go to a website that is not Cool Virus enabled, I get very upset. And I'm such a fan that these guys have actually made me Cool Virus evangelist cards that I give out to everybody. So that's a little, I am full disclosure. I am full disclosure. It's beginning. So you guys, this is kind of an interesting founding team. First of all, how did you guys all get to know each other? So Johnny, maybe you could tell us how this all happened. Sure, yeah. Actually, the company we started back in January of 2006. And this came up with an idea like the other friend of mine had called with a very simple idea saying, if you mouse over a link, then you can see a page. We got called Mayank. And Josh and I had actually met in my previous startup. And Josh is to come on some of the studies and give us some advice and feedback. And here I had stayed in touch. He looked like a very dynamic guy, very hungry and wanted to conquer the world and very well connected. So Josh and I were chatting about this and what could we do potentially with this. As Josh says, I know a genius who has attended a class with me and that genius is Austin. And it says, well, why don't we all figure out? And so we started off with a very, very simple thing. And I think, you know, I fairly believe it. It's much easier to just sort of jump in as long as you know the basic boundary. That's where we have that's where we knew. And then we got started. And then very soon Josh was instrumental in getting a ski on who helped us on things. And then Ron Yee, another Stanford student, who was doing his PhD back then. That's how the team was formed. I mean, did we start it? Well, Austin, I know that you are all hooked up to give us a little bit of a demo. Because I think a picture is definitely worth a thousand words when it comes to Cool Iris. So maybe you can show us what you're doing. And for the people who are on the radio audience, maybe you can talk over to make sure that everyone knows exactly what you're showing us. Just for a quick market research dinner, would you mind asking the audience how many have seen Cool Iris? How many of you know about Cool Iris? Raise your hands. Oh, it looks like about 85%. Raise your hands if you've never heard of Cool Iris. Okay, yeah, I'll tell you about 15%. How many of you have Cool Iris on your computer that have downloaded it? Okay, a lot. And how many of you use it? More than once. You know, basically go back and count on it when you go to sites especially when there's a lot of graphics. Okay, it looks like about 45%. Okay. It's not what I think it's a bottom over there. No, no, this is the one that's going then. Are we having some technical difficulties? How many of you have Cool Iris, by the way? How many people in the room are from Cool Iris? Yeah, did we pack the house with Cool Iris, folks? Okay, we've got about, for those people who are listening, we've got about 20 people in the room who are from Cool Iris. Okay, so let's start out. Maybe you can work behind the scenes here to try to get the technology working. Okay, and... You cannot get it. I don't think it's possible. It's not possible to get it. All right. You can start. I'm curious what concept you started out with at the beginning and what your mission was when you started? So the concept was, you know, as I said, the first one was you mouse over a link and it shows you the page. But that's not the concept that was just a feature or most people would say, well, that's a good tool utility, if you will. The idea there was, and this is a lot of great to actually ask, and to say, this is all about contextual navigation, which is while you are doing a search and you see the results, you do not have to lose the context. It's in the mind when you see a different page and then you lead down a different path, and that's not the path that you were trying to go towards. You are now basically helped by the tool to retain the context. So for instance, you do a search. This is our first product which we now call as school previews, which is just actually this week reached a 5 million download count on Mozilla. The idea there was, it solves a pain point that is universal. It's a very tiny pain point, but everybody in the world feels it. They feel it every single day, and it's related to contextual navigation. So that's where we started off, and then that was three years ago, and today the team remains the same, but the product and the team and technology has evolved significantly. So maybe one of you can answer the question, at what point did you actually pitch this to someone and sort of feel like it was far enough ahead that you could actually tell someone a little bit about what you were doing? So this was a very evolutionary process for us. It wasn't sort of a one day we said, okay, now we're there. And Sujania has a lot of contacts in the valley. Is the mic not working? Could you guys turn on the mic? Yeah. Hello? Is that better? All right, great. It's a progressive process, and a lot of credit to Sujania for pushing us on this. It was all about going out and getting feedback repetitively. So we started out by meeting different potential partners, we met with the CEO of Technoradi, we met with people at Yahoo, and it was really all about getting feedback. How do you see this fitting in with your business? How do you see this fitting in with your user base? And at one point, Sujania had a contact at Kleiner Perkins named Ajit. Again, same kind of thing. We said, we wanted to pitch our business model at the time, and we went in and got some feedback from him. Got him excited, and then another partner at Kleiner Perkins, Randy Comissar, who many of you may know from E145, saw it, set up another feedback meeting, who Austin and I had taken classes with. And then he really sort of caught wind of the bigger vision and really started saw it. So again, it wasn't like one day we've arrived, it was progressively going out and getting feedback from different people, and then eventually it started to pick up traction. Did you actually have a product? Did you have something to show, or was just an idea at that stage? We did have a product. We had launched the first product. We had some data to show in terms of what the usability is, what people are using it for. Some stats to go along with it. Obviously, we had not raised a penny for a year and a half. So the cost side looked very favorable. It wasn't a, we incurred X amount of variable costs, and we had to buy 20,000 servers to do this. So, and then the business model, we had, you know, we had great brainstorming sessions. So I think one of the main things that we had done along with a couple of other folks was continue and try and iterate on the early concept and see where all that can be done. And Austin is a bit product visionary to say, well, this we can take it this way, or we can go that way, or we can take it the other way round. And so it's really all about basically making sure that we had the right pieces together. We did not have every single, I think I've never written a business plan myself. I don't know if anybody writes business plan anymore. I think it's just a slight deck. And what Josh is referring to is we basically used to keep on talking to the VCs and the invested community, because we ourselves were investing our time. And I think time is just as big of an asset as capital is. And we would always like to run some crossings. So we never really pitched to say we were raising financing. But we would say we would love to get your feedback. And if it was interesting for them, they were going to say we would like to invest. I love that. I love this old saying that if you ask for money, you get advice. If you ask for advice, you get money. You didn't know that. But I think that's what it worked out. Great. So I know that you ended up being incubated then at KP, right? Right? Client of Perkins incubated you. How involved were they through the process? I know that Randy was passionate about what you're doing and still is. Did he have a desk there? How often did you see him? Did he come in and start coding? You know, Austin, maybe you could tell us a little bit about how Randy was involved. Sure. So Randy's been very involved since the beginning. We were in the incubator for almost a year. And they were right next door to us across the bridge. And so Randy and Trey, both of whom have been working very closely with us ever since we started talking with them, come over several times a week. And would brainstorm with us, see updates, bring in visitors so we get to show off our stuff to dignitaries and other people who are visiting KP. Colin Powell was a fan. And they've been really instrumental in helping us to think about our products and how it can evolve to become something much more than where it started, which was as a way to discover and view pictures on the web. How do you take that and make it into something that people use every day as a part of their daily routine? So it's been great to work with them and they've been a huge part of it. But in a way where they were collaboratively and not kind of in your business. It was a micro management. See, that's a duty of it. I think Randy is a master at, I mean, he's a true guru to us and not just the three of us but the entire company and the test to that. And it's been phenomenal in terms of just making sure that he gives us sort of a coach or a guidance rather than saying this is exactly what you should do and following up on this is what you did or not. That wasn't the case at all. Okay, but I'm assuming that there were some metrics. I mean, they certainly didn't just give you money in space and say just go run around do whatever you want. What kind of metrics did they set out for you and were they metrics were easier or challenging to reach? Well, we beat the, so the, I guess, taking a step back the way the investment was made it was a tranched investment, which is, you know, basically, I don't know if you guys know all tranched investment, but in effect, a particular piece is given to you a million basically is what we are done on the tranched mechanism and say you need to hit a couple of metrics there and the metrics were active users. I mean, that's a very simple metrics in our in our business as simple as much as let me show you we have it printed on the back set of a toothbrush that everybody all our tina this one is for you although maybe it was on the floor. Did you do that? We are better. But the metrics are imprinted at the back and it says in a weekly core metrics are active users engagement time and revenue per user. So who gets these toothbrushes? Everybody in the company. So they basically every morning when they brush our teeth every night when they brush our teeth they know exactly what the metrics are. That's the point. It doesn't show what the numbers are, but this is where actually Kevin who is associated with may feel through Elizabeth he's the engineering lead and then Christian are over here. They've been making sure that we have the exact same metrics in as much real time basis as we can. You could get tattoos on everyone. And then you never go out of that. Yeah, you're right. No, with the metrics. So the expectation was for a year that since the amount of money that would last we'd be in eight months we'd hit the metrics and then we took on the second round. I also get a guess that as you've put your product out there you've gotten a lot of really interesting responses from the market. How has the product changed in response to user feedback? Austin will we can answer that best? Sure. So our first product was previews which Sijanya described earlier. And the response to that was very positive, but it was also somewhat polarizing. We'd find that people would install it and either become very passionate users or uninstall it because it was one of those features that changes the way you use the web. And overwhelmingly though we saw a lot of promise with that. And when we created PickLens which was the photo centric version of our contextual browsing concept, we found that people really enjoyed looking at photos in full screen and experiencing things in a much richer less distracting way. And so between these two products we started to focus on how we can take PickLens which became Coolaris and make it into something that can still integrate with the browser but also not have any of the distracting side effects that our original product had at the time. And one lesson I would say and this is something that we've learned tremendously over the last I would say six months. There is no substitute for going out and actually watching your users use the product. I would say this is at least on a personal level this has been one of the things that's been the most illuminated to me. For instance, to give you a very concrete example of this we have a search box in the top right hand corner of our product and we found people aren't using this feature that much a while back and we said I wonder why this could be it so powerful people are asking for it. And we actually found out that the people in our office we have mostly these bright screened Macintoshes. And then when you go and you look at it on a low NPC you actually don't see the search box because it was a little bit dimmer and you'd see it on a Mac. And there's all these things that you know it's impossible to overcome the biases that you have when you're actually looking at your own product. And it's really cool when you actually go out and see people with fresh eyes take a look there's really no substitute for it. So that's been one very illuminating thing for us as far as product development. So if you are developing products that's absolutely do it you know do it every week go out and talk to users. Do you want to get to date out of those two either way? Do you guys do A.B. testing you know releasing several versions of the product at once and looking to see which ends up having a bigger response? So we've started to do that with the website and the welcome page that you see after you install we measure the conversion to launching the products after that. And the frequency of launching one week later and so we've used that to tune that page and we're starting to do that more in the client. It's harder to do it with software that people download it's easier to modify a website to run an experiment. But we've started to incorporate experiments into the client itself through communication with the server. So definitely we see it as one of the most important things that we do to improve the products on an ongoing basis. And another thing to add there too is you know in Suganya big time credit to Suganya for this and for Krishna and the Kevin. Like a big transition for us has really been trying to move to be more of a data driven company. And you know a lot of people talk about that and it's another thing to set up the system and to architect your organization in such a way that everybody is accountable to a number and to data. And you know Suganya has done a phenomenal job of everybody from engineers and product managers all the way down to interns where you have an accountable metric to actually look at. And it's very very measurable and easy to see your successes you go. So that's something that you know we've really focused on a lot and it really does give you insight into how people and users are using your product. Great so how many people are at the company now? We are right now around 34 full time. Yeah, 34 full time. Full time. We actually call it more than full time. And Austin and Kevin are all the time. Then we have another big gang of about 25 interns who we call as party teammates. And I can see actually second row here, RJ and Richard and all these guys all from the party team. So we've leveraged the student house power and we blended the two in terms of experience plus innovation and raw energy and conditioned energy to really drive innovation and collaboration. Okay, so I know I got a chance to talk to you about this recruiting process that I think is brilliant and I think you guys how many students in the room have been touched by cool irises recruiting efforts. Okay, just a handful of you. Okay, except okay, well listen, there's a few opportunity. I have to tell you I would like Josh to tell a little bit story here because when I met you, you had just started cool irises. And one of the biggest challenges, of course it was during a big, I guess maybe we'll call it another bubble, the bubble echo. And it was really hard for you to recruit people. You were pulling your hair out trying to figure out how do I get really, really talented students to come to cool irises. And you ended up turning the assumptions upside down and doing some very creative things. Maybe you could tell us a little bit about that. Sure. There was really sort of two paths for recruiting. One was recruiting full time engineers and the other was recruiting interns. On the full time side, what we really learned is you always hear it everywhere, people say A players hire A players and you probably heard it every ETL. And no one ever says, okay, well how do you hire A players? And for us, we really learned and we'd bring people in, we'd walk them in, we'd have them interview. And they'd interview and we'd say, hey we're doing this great stuff but we can't tell you and it's going to be really awesome and take our word for it. And everyone would go, okay, they'd go back and say, okay, well I have free food at Google and all these unvested stock options and my life's pretty good. And I'm working on a big corporate job so the extra 20 hours a week at the start up probably not a great thing. And we found out that really, the really, really great, amazing A plus people out there in the world are people that already have great opportunities right there. They're very sought after. So we completely reversed the process. And what we started doing, we'd walk people through it. So we were in the kind of Perkins office. We'd walk them in through the front door of Kleiner Perkins. Walk them in, walk them past John Doer and build Joy's office, now Joy's office, kind of casually. Bring them across the bridge, make sure they stop and got the fancy drinks in the refrigerator. And then we'd sit them down and this is, you know, Sajani is saying we'd say, you know, we're going to sell this person like they're John Doer. And bring them in and say, you know, and really just kind of paint the picture for them and it comes at a risk, right? You're giving away some information at the time, but it really is a way to, you know, like, if you're going to get the best people, you have to get them excited. On the internship side, you know, credit goes to Sajani for this program. It's really McWatt and Juneau. Exactly. I don't have the corner for this. Yeah, so I think what really helped us turn the corner was bringing in a couple of people, you know, how many of you guys have read Malcolm Gladwell? Tipping point. Yeah, and they talk a lot about connectors. And we brought in a couple of people, you know, specifically Matt Wall and General Greenbritter, a couple of students from here that were just a both highly respected and sort of the technical and engineering community, but also very, very social. And that's sort of a combination you don't find all that much and really sort of allowing them to, you know, evangelize the company for you and to move out and, you know, identify who the great people are and get them excited to come in. I also love the fact that once you started getting the parade of people coming in, you took them all. You kind of just started it, right? Right, so what have you do that? What happened? So the product and engineering team had the timing worked out great, I think. So the product was done around Jan 15th, time frame, and this is basically a year ago. And Matt and Jonah would bring in people that they had met the night before, or I don't know if they were picking them up from. Maybe we don't want to know about this. I don't know about that. But everybody was amazing. I mean, they would really come in, very passionate, very excited. We actually had one person who we didn't actually accept and then he wrote a very passionate letter saying, you know, here's why I think. So we brought him in again and we actually accepted him. It wasn't the case that we accepted everybody blindly. We did talk to every person. But the need of the company, I think, matched nicely with the student energy and passion that was available at that point in time. And then we said, you know what? Why not? And Randy was very supportive of that idea. He being a guru again, you know, he says, yeah, let's try it out. And it worked great. Well, I love the fact that it gave you an opportunity to kind of test drive all these folks and see how passionate and motivated they were and what they actually delivered. Exactly. So obviously recruiting was a big challenge. And you figured out some interesting ways to get over those hurdles. What other big challenges? I mean, we know that starting a company is basically a collection of getting over a bunch of hurdles. What have been the big hurdles that have faced all of you that are most memorable over the last couple of years? Well, I guess the biggest challenges that my memory are building the products, starting out it was a MAC only, Safari only, browser extension. And getting that to work was pretty challenging and fun. But the biggest challenge I think came when we wanted to go cross platform. We wanted to be both Mac and Windows compatible and work on Firefox and on IE. And so we had to totally rewrite it. And I had to learn a whole bunch of Win32. And creating something that works really well on one platform is so much easier than creating something that works across multiple platforms because you have to create these things. So you have to create these intermediate layers to abstract away the differences between each operating system and each browser. And so taking what we had built from the user experience perspective and moving that into being kind of a ubiquitous foundation that we could run on any computer on any browser was probably the biggest challenge that I've experienced so far with the team. But it's been really fun and we did it. So, Josh. I guess just sort of abstracting that theme a little bit. It's execution is really the hard part. In my opinion, we talk about these things. Okay, we want to be a data driven company. And we want to make sure that everybody starts their experience inside of cool iris on the internet. And there's these great ideas that are floating around. And it's really sort of taking these abstract ideas and turning them into either tangible organizational structure and processes. So, Johnny has his operational expertise. I mean, has really saved us and allowed us to do that. Or taking these abstract and really awesome product ideas and building it in a way that's fast and performant and works. And that's better than the current internet. And that's where Austin's expertise comes in. So it's really sort of taking these ideas and with very, very limited resources, converting them to actual action. And the hard part really is you always have to cut some, right? And I think that's the real challenge there is just prioritization and saying, okay, there's these five amazing product ideas and we can only do one of them well. So we need to pick it and go for it. For me, it is finding the best people. That's always the hardest. No matter how much you grow and at what stage you are at. And the team that we have built, actually the bar is so high that the next one has to come and further is the bar. If that's even possible, the hardest thing to do. Very, very hard. So you've got people, you've got sort of decision making processes, you've got the technology, I mean all of these are challenges. And we would all guess that these are big challenges. What have been the biggest surprises that have happened? I'm going to guess that things have happened that you sort of get up one morning and go, oh my god, I just didn't expect this. Good surprises or bad surprises? Okay. Good surprises, bad surprises. What happens on Friday nights now? One of the biggest surprises, honestly, is when we started, I think touched on this earlier is, again, sitting in front of users and actually watching the user product. Kind of keep coming back to the steam. But you don't, it's so easy to not understand and not realize how little attention or how short the attention span is for consumers. So I don't know, for me that was the biggest surprise and how sort of, how much difficulty people will have doing things that you take to be simple and then only when you sort of find out and see it through their eyes that are actually no more and more complex. Yeah, I would say, you know, from the technical side, the biggest surprise was, how bad open-jill drivers were for open, for an Intel integrated graphics. That was pretty bad, actually. You really saw Windows version and then everyone was white screening. They'd click and then their screen would turn white. And so, you start out, you have a small product, a small user base, and you have a couple of problems and you handle them. But when you have hundreds of thousands of people who are affected by a major problem, you wake up and say, oh gosh, that's really bad. So that was, in similar events like that have been the biggest kinds of surprises where you realize that there's something wrong with the product and you need to fix it as soon as possible. And we had one or two of those in the early days and we've managed to avoid anything like that in the last year and a half plus. But yeah, those are big surprises. For me, by the way, so we had a feature which unfortunately, I guess we have not been able to demo, but for those of you who know this feature called Discover, which lets you basically navigate and find cool content and then navigate to that. And that was completely sort of, you know, conceived by Austin and the team, but was completely executed by all the interns, only interns. The first six months, purely intern, so we actually had Chris Anderson, I guess he's not here, but Chris Anderson was a freshman from Stanford, he came in and, you know, we handed off that responsibility onto him and very well executed in terms of what can be done by just basic guidance and passionate energy. It was a surprise. We were thinking of it being it works. Great, so it's perfect timing that we get a little sort of break here in the discussion to get a demo because I think for people in the room who've never seen it, I think they'll be surprised. My favorite thing is the e-corder website that we run that has the video clips from this lecture series is cool I was enabled. And so when people come into my office and I do a demo and I click the little button to open it up, I love it. Everybody goes, this is amazing. So I'm hoping that you can give everyone the audience that same experience. I hope so too. With that warm up. So this is this is cool iris. It's installed into Firefox. And the way I normally use Google Images, I do a search for sunset. I will... That is not cool iris. It is listening, it just crashed. Wow, awesome. You see how fast you go. How about you, guys? I'm going to keep talking while you work on this. I'm going to put a man behind the curtain there. We can see that Austin is in charge of dealing with all the technical issues. How do the rest of the responsibilities get divided up? And you and I are three founders. Three is often an interesting number. And I'm wondering how well you guys do this. Are there clear demarcations about where one person's responsibilities begin in another end? Has it something that's had to be negotiated? Give us a little clue how this has worked. Google, please. See that was one right? So I look to Sujani and then he tells me. So I think in the early days when you're three people or four people in a garage or in our case a small office, it really comes down to, I think, really two things. One is mutual respect. And respecting each other and knowing each other what they're good at. So that way. And things don't, it's not like, it's not someone says, okay, you're going to do this and you're going to do this. And I mean, titles in a four person startup are meaningless. It really just kind of happens organically. If you're talking, if we're going to be doing something with partnerships or legal or financial stuff, Sujani has a tremendous amount of experience. And if it's a product or technology question, it's obviously just going to default to Austin. And I think it just comes from a mutual respect for one another to know each other's strengths and weaknesses and defer to each other where it makes the most sense. So that's the biggest one. Was that agree? I think so. We've never really sat down and say, I think you are in charge of this, this or this. And by the way, this actually extends just beyond even the founding team. We've never, we've tried to create a way sort of a flat hierarchy, but where it's not a chaotic, hippie movement, everybody knows what's going on. You're fully empowered, but you're also fully accountable. And that's the model that has actually worked right from day one. And I think to a fair extent, it sort of works even today in that sense. I would say to sort of echo what Josh said, I think the key premise for compartmentalization of responsibilities is comes from respect for each other and trust. If those two endadians are there, then you automatically know that's the core competency. And email comes in, and honestly, we don't even need to say can you take this? Can you take out this? The person automatically knows, takes initiative and bingo gets done. There are clearly examples of companies where employees are empowered to spend some of their free time experimenting with new ideas on their own. Does that happen? Do you have people sort of doing skunk works projects and they come to you when it's sort of fully baked? Wow, that's a surprise. I don't know if anybody has free time. But there are skunk works projects to a certain extent. We don't have formalized like 10% or 20% kind of thing. In fact, why don't I let Austin show you and then there's one feature that I'll call out what was done in free time. Perfect. Right, Austin. So now we have it working. Take two. Okay. So, oh my gosh. Okay. Good. Okay. Good. Okay. So, I do a search for sunset. Normally, I get a grid of images. Usually, you're used to photos or web page results being paginated. You click next. You see something you like. You have to click it and maybe click it again. You can see, you know, what you search for. But then if it's not what you wanted, you have to use the back button and then continue. So, we wanted to just make this really easy. So, what we do is we mouse over an image and click this. And then you can launch into the wall. And so, the wall is basically this 3D view of all of the results from exactly the same query that you entered on the website. So, I can go down, see a photo that looks good to me and click it. And then it loads the high-res version of it in place. So, there's no need for me to navigate away from the context of my search. I can just bring up that particular result in place. So, that's what it looks like on Google Images. I can also do a search on Flickr. Let's say for San Francisco. And bring up those results. And then, as you can see, we're loading one page at a time as you scroll. So, there's no need to think about next, previous, what page am I on, etc. And this is where we started with Images, but we also added support for video. So, I can do a search for, let's say, Surf on YouTube and then watch a video, and then watch the video in the wall. And so... Would you do me a favor? Can you go to the e-corner website? Just because I think it's pretty cool. What's that? Okay. All right. Just click on videos. Yeah. Just pop their videos. So, yeah, here we go. But Andy don't do. I always tell people that with distinguishes so-called, but only is that. We don't have to listen to the whole thing. It just crews the wall for a second. I think it's interesting just to see. So, the whole idea is that you don't get stuck anywhere. That you're always, you know, in a context, and you can move around within that context, the way you would in a real environment. So, once you see a video that looks interesting, you can take it into full screen. So, volume. And then everything kind of disappears and you can just experience the content. But if you want to go back, you can just return to the search context and keep on moving. And so, we've done, we did this originally with images, then added video, and now we support any kind of flash content. As Sejonya mentioned, we have a product called Discover, which is an aggregation of content from around the web. And we have featured channels for things like the presidential inauguration. We actually streamed the inauguration live through this channel. But you can go in here and you can watch content from Hulu or ABC or New York Times, BBC. A whole bunch of premium entertainment news and sports content sources. So, for example, I could go into sports and watch highlights from games that have been happening. And one thing I guess you can notice is that the performance is unusually fast. We put a lot of energy into making it basically zero latency if you have a reasonable internet connection. So, as you're moving through, you don't wait for buffering, you don't wait for loading, you don't have to change pages, you just go directly to the content and consume the content. We also have a shopping feature which Josh is actually proactively championing right now and making better all the time. So, I can do a search in here, let's say for an iPod. And then we automatically pick the right category and let you browse through the wall to find what you're looking for. So, let's say that I want a nano, I can select it here, I read information about it, and then I can jump out to Amazon's website to actually purchase the product or read more information. Okay, so on this note, what is your business model? I mean, it's free for all of us to download this. I use it all the time, I don't pay penny, right? What's just like the rest of the web, how do you support this? I think it's a good segue into continuing the demos. Sure, so I'll just keep demoing this. So, as you're going down the wall, the mouse stopped working. Okay, well anyway, as you're going down the wall, you see advertisements that are just part of the content. And so, you know, the difference between this and a web page is that in a web page you have the content which takes the main focus and then ad banners or, I guess, skyscrapers on the periphery of the page competing for your attention. And in our environment, you're moving from content to content and occasionally you'll crossover something which is an ad. And ads themselves can be compelling content. And I'll let you talk a bit about the statistics that we found. Sure, I guess in our particular interface, what we find is we see at least a 10X or a 20X creator click through rates on ads. And in fact, Kong is the product manager for Inline ads there. He has a lot more data which has been able to sell to the advertising agencies and advertisers as to why this is a good substrate or a good media to show and display ads. It's currently priced based on performance. So, there's no risk to the ad agencies and especially in the down economy where everybody wants an ROI on the money that they're spending or they would like to put it in the allocate from a magazine onto the internet. It provides a great substitute to really say your ad dollars are going to be spent on users who spend, you know, roughly equivalent of a television show every week. And the millions of users that we have do spend a lot of time watching the ads and that's how we make money. The second revenue stream comes from shopping where when asked in demo, when you land from basically you navigate and then you decide this is a product that you would like to buy, then we get an affiliate fee from the e-commerce app. So, you sell ads directly for the wall. That's correct. And then you get an affiliate fee for sales. For the shopping. Shopping. Interesting. So, I could not call out because I guess this build doesn't have local but I was going to say local was a feature that Kevin built and his part time from 2 a.m. to 3 a.m. The spare time he had and then we actually have that feature going in our next release. We can navigate local content. Okay, so I'm going to ask one more question and then I'm going to open it up to the audience. So, I'd love to start thinking about questions that you might have for these guys. You keep referring to the fact that people are there around the clock. Okay. Not there but they are working. They're working or are engaged, you know, a good part of the day. Could you tell us a little bit about the culture of the company because you clearly you've got a lot of really young, energetic folks. People are working really hard. What tells a little bit more about the culture? So, can I try something and this is a surprise but can I get actually one of them to mention what the culture is rather than us saying what the culture is? Can I maybe like Kevin say? Sure. I've got a microphone to give in. Why don't you say what the culture is? Yeah. Pass the microphone. Take care of it. Sorry to put you on the spot but I think it's better. Okay, I can't. Kevin, wow. Okay. I would say the biggest thing about our culture is it's completely collaborative. As I mentioned, we don't. There's not a lot of hierarchy. We all work as a team and people's responsibilities, I think, span different teams. So I'll do, I work on different, I work across some of those in the server sets and as I work on the product, you saw Austin does product stuff. Josh does multiple product stuff. Josh does recruiting. So, Johnny does everything. On nothing. So I think the common thing that I've noticed, I'm young, I haven't had that many jobs but everyone enjoys coming into work. And that has been, that was markedly different than the places I work before. We have a great rapport. If you go to the office we're divided, the bottom floor is the second floor is engineering and the bottom floor is pretty much everything else. And you, at 3 o'clock every day, the place just explodes and you hear, you hear people yelling and screaming for no reason. It just gets very loud and obstinuous. I'm not feeling the family set. I think I'm getting people a bit nervous. I think everyone enjoys coming to work because we get along really well. The second floor we laugh a lot. We work really hard. But we have a great time together. And so it doesn't feel like work. I guess the bottom line. I think the truth is it's a passionate team and it's not passionate team performing not under pressure but it's really because we're all driven to the same cause. Very ambitious. We all know this is what we want to get and everybody's having fun. I think that what you just did there was reflective of how you run the company. Right? Is that you invite everybody into the process. Even whatever role they are. So it's someone in the audience can get up and share their insight. So I love that because you just demonstrated the culture of the company. So let me, let me open it up to questions. Yeah, over here. And I'm going to ask our panelists to repeat the question. I was just wondering about you guys are using sort of other people's images. So the feeders service and you get advertising revenue from that. I was wondering how the suppliers of those images when you're downloading the high resolution version of them. But not showing their advertising. There's sort of a conflict there between you and them. We should actually, can you pull up the demo if you don't mind? Sure. I'll start by saying that we only monetize currently within Discover, which is a destination which we bring users to. And so users who come to that content actually end up linking out to the content owners website. So we aren't actually monetizing on top of a page view which somebody is already acquired. We're generating pages for those content owners. And in terms of the relationship with those content owners, let's, Ajani, talk a bit about how we manage that. So the deal basically is publishers and content providers want to serve their content into the interface because we drive traffic to their site. We don't charge them for that. It's a new user acquisition for them. And they get to monetize the content. If it's a video, they can do a pre-reual post roll whatever and they keep those revenues. So they actually not only get new users coming in their content syndication strategy site. They are actually able to monetize those users which are our users in fact. So it's the opposite. It's not we are taking their content and putting our ads and making money. That's not what we do because that would happen if we were doing in search. Under Discover, it's the content that they have provided us feeds with. So we either drive content to their site or we make their money. So that's a good deal. Yeah, I mean, but for the image thing, there are some controversy where there are some mail-in all the images and some minutes will not abandon it. So we don't monetize that. I mean, you're still using your bandwidth. Maybe some people might get, I don't know. So the linkouts happen which is what drives new users to their site. I think that's a positive there. And then on the page view site, they do get a credit for the page views. That's the other significant part of that. Did you want to share something here? I was just showing linkouts and embedded advertising in video. Great. Do we have another question? Yes. There's also a flip side to this picture. Right? We're going to take on from a sort of, what it has to do with that. And they throw on like, you know, five ads is a separate thing. And they use it to look like, you know, very many different reasons that they do it. And they figure out these days are good for the users, so it's a few more ads. So your adulation and kind of separate content. I don't know. I want that. So if I understand what you're saying, Hulu is already inserting ads. And so for us to insert additional ads on top of that, we're further compounding the user annoyance. So I think that there's some degree of truth to that. But there's also kind of two user modes. One is surfing around trying to find something to watch. And the other is actually consuming the content. So Hulu can insert the ads while you're watching the episode. And you're not going to walk away because, you know, you're watching the episode. And when you're moving from content to content, that's kind of a different time. So I guess we're not showing ads while the video is playing. It's, they're mutually exclusive. So Hulu is doing interstitial video ads or midrall ads. And we're doing intra content ads. A great metaphor to think about is Google search, right? So like on the Google search page, you have, you know, snippets of the content. And then Google's ads. And as soon as you click out, as soon as you go to engage with that content, then that monetization is owned by the content owner. Same model. Another question? Yeah. How do you give interns projects that are self-contained in the short time that they're there? And like, how do you get them interact with projects that are real technical? So we are very familiar with the effect that you call as Cabo Effect, which is all of, all interns go away at the same time. They're all partying and I guess I don't know what they're doing, but we see their photos on Facebook. But we, it does have that. You have to create projects that we know will undergo a lack of attention during those periods of time. Some projects are scopeable, I think. And that's, the projects have also changed from, you know, from like a year ago, when sort of more discovery oriented to Katie who heads recruiting now, which of course works very well with the recruiting season here. So you do have to select projects that will work well with the intern model. So I don't think every single project works with the intern model. So for example, there are some interns who work with the engineering team directly, but those interns have been with us for a very long time and have become a part of the core team in many respects. So. I was wondering if you could comment on sort of the changes that the revenue officer has brought. How has changed your outlook? Sure. So the question is, how has the outlook of the company changed and what has it been the contribution of the Chief Revenue Officer? So the moment we hit our 1 million active user account, which is when we got the tranche, the first thing we said is, you know, we were going to hire in somebody who's done this before. And so Shashi said, who is the Chief Revenue Officer for us, he had been the head of monetization for YouTube. And he knew Randy well, so it was sort of an easier conversation to get going. He joined us, he's done phenomenally well. They have a now revenue team of which Hong, who's the product manager sitting behind and then Josh, who's on the shopping side. So he was able to come in and firstly bring in the focus. He put together the team that was needed for each of the revenue models that we were pursuing. And then set up a framework of experimentation by working with the engineering team and said, even if we don't start driving revenues today, we need to know where the faucet in the room is and then we can turn the faucet on whenever we want. So let's just first figure out just as much of innovation that we have created on the product side, let's just do also the same thing on the monetization side. And to be very honest, even today we are partly in that mode. We are driving revenues today, which is a good thing in this economy. But we are also experimenting simultaneously on multiple aspects of what can be monetized, what cannot be all of this while making sure that the users are happy. That's fundamental value for us as a company. The one situation we didn't want to get into was the situation where you kind of hear, we're going to just build this huge user base and then we're going to figure out how to monetize it later. And I think that was sort of a recurring theme that you saw on Web 2.0. And you're seeing it with the social networks, how difficult it is to actually monetize a lot of that traffic. In fact, if you look at the model almost everywhere else, it's the opposite. They say, you know what, we're going to figure out how to get our revenue per customer very high. And then at that point you have a lot of control, right? Because then you can buy distribution, you can do other things like that. So we're more focused on experimenting and really tweaking and iterating to find out how do we get our revenue per customer number high. And then going out and simultaneously solving the distribution problem. But it makes it a lot easier to solve. I love the concept I've heard you mentioned this before. Basically building it with the faucets in the room. You're not sure exactly when you're going to turn them on, but you certainly know where they're there. And I think that's a really good thing to keep in mind for anyone who's starting an e-commerce company. You might not at the beginning want to figure out what your revenue stream is, but you need to know what you're going to do in the future. And simultaneously we keep an eye on the cost side as well, right from day one. Not like we say, let's grow the user base and we'll worry about how the cost structure looks like. Because then you're going to scale the business and then be stuck with this issue of how can I now take down my variable costs. So essentially you're putting in a really sturdy foundation at the beginning knowing that you can build on it. Super. Yeah, there's a question right there. Who are your biggest current potential competitors and how are you guys planning ahead of them? So I guess this is an interesting question. As a 3D browser extension for viewing Rich Media content, we don't really have any direct competitors. There are people who are cloning parts of our user experience, which we see as potentially competitive. And there are other client applications, which are sort of web-centric, which can enable, I guess, content discovery or content. Sharing experiences. But really I think our biggest competitor is more about time in the day. So we're competing for users' attention. So the time that they spend in the traditional web on their browser is really what we're competing for. And so we're competing for that, I guess, with the traditional paradigm of web navigation. Yeah, so I think one thing to add to that is when you're thinking about competition and a business that's not, you're not thinking necessarily about who's building the same product. You're thinking about who's solving the same user need, right? So like the iPod, competition wasn't necessarily another MP3 player. It was really the disk man and the Walkman by Sony. You know, tons of other examples, for instance, the PDA, their competition now is the cell phone, even though there's tons of PDA companies out there. So you really want to think about from a competition perspective, who's meeting the needs of your customers, not who's building the same product? So I'm up level it slightly, a little bit too. You have technology competitors, you have business competitors, you also have competitors for competing for the same talent. So I think you need to break down just as you segment your market for customers, you need to segment your market for competition. So on that note, you must be looking into the future saying, what are you going to do next? I mean, what's your next surprise for us? What are we going to see Kool-Irus doing after everybody's using this? What new features, what new aspects can we look forward to? So in our next release, we're going to be extending the amount of metadata that you can see around content. We're going to be extending support for sites that you can browse on the web. We can't really discuss exactly what we're doing, but in general, our goal is to make the product be much more widely useful as you interact with the internet and also make it more integrated to the fabric of your everyday life. And so we're going to be adding capabilities to the software and evolving in a direction that I think will be very compelling for anyone who likes the internet. Did you want to see us? A teen-nasty-like channel on Discover. Don't talk about that. It's top secret. So secret, no one will know. Okay, questions. So first, you guys have on the Stikus UI that's seen in a long time, so I just want to come back to you on the team. Often then, indeed, it's mostly very good. So I want to ask you a question with a second time about 34 full-time people coming up in terms. That's a high-period rate. So I'm guessing you've kind of already run through your first round. And so what's it been like to go out and do fundraising in, for the second round? So last year, just for comparables, we were 10 full-time and we had 40 interns, 4-0. So we really leveraged the student horsepower. And it wasn't done for cost reasons, but it did end up becoming a cost-effective business. So where we are is we did close another round recently and cost is something, you know, just because we are 34 people, we not everybody draws full salary, so it doesn't necessarily mean that we have a high-burn rate. We actually do a fairly decent job of making sure that our just overall cost and cost not just for a cost expense perspective, but cost from a productivity perspective. And those two can be two different things. And when you sort of prove those out to the investor in terms of what you have been able to do, so first year and a half of the company, we had zero money, so we couldn't run out of any money. Then we had, you know, three out of that first million was a tranche. So I think we've been able to show that we can execute within the confines of what we have. And I think we actually got credit for doing that. And one big advantage of running the company for about a year before we had any money was that the product's plan and the whole idea was based on the idea that you can build this and deliver value without running giant clusters of servers. I think I'm going to quote you on that. If you don't have any money, you can't run out of it. Great, great line. Okay, another question, yeah. How could the click for a few rate, compared to the say Google ads in random size and how high the price for the asset in the open click that they have to say to you? So please repeat the question. Sure. Hong, you should answer this question. Can you repeat the question? So why don't you just answer it? Yeah. The question is, compared to a Google ad sense ad click through rates, how good are our click through rates? Can you stand up and speak loudly? So the most direct comparison you can make of our click to play video ads where there's a video thumbnail and you click an ad like a gatorade on a website and in place. Traditionally, those have been around 0.3 to 0.5%. So 0.3 to 0.5% of all the thumbnails you seek it clicked. What we're seeing in the wall is that a high engagement ad like that gets anywhere from 3 to 6%. So like Sujian said, something higher than 10x of what you see on the web. So that's really good ROI for any of the advertisers that are out there. And in addition to just getting the selection information to the advertisers, we also tell them how much time they use your mouse is over a thumbnail. How much time they spend looking at that video, how much time they look at content around it, and a huge slew, a long list of metrics that we can give them that they can't get online. So it helps them optimize their campaigns, it helps them figure out what ads are better and what, which of these different channels. So not only do you get better engagement, you also get much more value added through Polaris. And advertisers love it. Great. Is there one last question from the room? Any last question? Great. Back there. We talked about the importance of testing with the public. So I was just wondering how you go out and find the people. Do you have targeted groups or establish basis of testers? Are you talking with random people? Please repeat it. So the question was around, how do you select when you do get your product in front of users? How do you select the right user? You're right. The correct approach is not to just spray less and say, come on, come on, come on, come try out Polaris. There's really a couple of ways that we do this. One, actually, we have a very avid user, what we call user growth team, who are always in constant touch with an email communication with our users. So sometimes we'll pull from there to get insight from them and say, hey, what do you like? What do you don't like? What's confusing for you? The idea that we do it is really around, you're trying to get a specific question answered. Without getting into too much detail, for instance, if we're talking about looking at photos on your local machine, you want to go out and find people that have at least two cameras and upload pictures to a website and take pictures at least once a quarter. So you really kind of want to look and say, okay, who's the target for this and then go out and find and talk to those people? And they're usually pretty vocal and we'll tell you a lot. Great. Well, I want to thank our panelists. I think this is incredibly impressive. I imagine that many of you are now brand new, cool, Irish evangelists, just like me. Thank you so much for coming. Thank you so much for this. I really appreciate it. Thank you. You have been listening to the entrepreneurial thought leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program.
