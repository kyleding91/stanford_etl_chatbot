 You are listening to the draper Fisher-Jurvinson entrepreneurial thought leader seminar brought to you weekly by Stanford Technology Ventures program at Stanford University School of Engineering. Today we have a wonderful double header. We have both Ray Lane and Ron Bloom here. Ray Lane is a partner at Kleiner Perkins Coffield Buyers and Ron Bloom is a CEO and founder of Pod Show and I'm going to interview them today. The focus is going to be on the relationship between a founder of a company and the venture capitalists who invest in them. So welcome. Thank you. Great. So the first question I want to ask both of you is you both have had really interesting and exciting careers and instead of my introducing you and sort of telling a story that probably isn't so accurate. I'd love each of you to tell a little bit of background of how you ended up on this stage here. How long do you have? As long as you want. You want me to go first? So I spent my entire career in technology. Born and raised in the East Coast, grew up in Pittsburgh, educated in Pittsburgh in West Virginia, went to West Virginia University in Carnegie Mellon. I still have an association with Carnegie Mellon today on their board of trustees. So I'm a I'm a router for Carnegie Mellon and and Stanford partnerships if we can generate them. But focused early on computer science technology, IBM, EDS spent 12 years with Booz Allen as a senior partner there running the information technology practice and then I spent eight years as president of Oracle. And I left Oracle in 2000 and joined the Cliner Perkins and have been for the last six and a half years investing in startup companies in information technology software primarily services and in clean tech. So it's an interesting new area for the venture industry and Cliner Perkins is in the last several years really focused on that say 40% of our resources are now focused on clean tech, the making investments in solar companies and electricity generation and storage in biofuels and and then I'm on a board of a coal gasification company that produces natural gas to the pipeline by gasifying coal in a single step. So that's as short as I can do it. For them at the time, great. So Ron. About 180 degrees opposite of Ray. I was raised in Atlanta and attended Georgia State University, a study philosophy, but my early career was as a musician. I've written and produced over 300 songs that have been published, played on over 2000 albums and began to get interested in technology after building a couple of recording studios. My last one I built with Chuck Norris as a partner in Los Angeles and building that studio. I came upon this technology called Fast Fourier Analysis which is now called sampling to the uninitiated and fast Fourier analysis and realized that we could use the internet to exchange files as we were trying to develop the software and I discovered what software was as a musician and that I needed it to help me with my tools. I sold my studio. I heard about this thing called the internet and decided to create a concept called cybercast and the idea of a cybercast came from a thought that I had that somehow the internet television and radio could work together to create information and entertainment rather than one displaced the other. This was in 1994. I needed a project in order to demonstrate how a cybercast might work so I had worked on some Grammy projects as an artist. I convinced the guy who fell around the Grammys at that time might green to go ahead and give me the license to create a cybercast for the Grammys. I asked around if anyone else knew what the internet was and you'd be surprised in 94 how many people said no. I found a guy who had just left MTV. His name was Adam Curry, a VJ and a VJ and a guitar player put together a company to cybercast the Grammys in 94. Just for fun. Yes, for fun. How many of you have heard of Adam Curry? I was hoping it'd be none of you but. Even he's getting too old for this population. We come around again. We get reused like that bio energy. This might be just an interesting quickie and that is that we thought that we could create a lot of noise around an idea which we did. The noise was tremendous and positive. The Grammys was a big success. We turned a tired brand into a live brand. We brought it to every college campus in the basically that was connected to the M-bone at that time. It's a pretty big deal. We thought that that would create so much noise at every entertainment organization and the world would want to do business with us and we would become successful people. Part A was right. We got attention but part B was exactly wrong. No entertainment company wanted to have anything to do with us because they feared the innovation that was created by this concept of bringing entertainment on to the internet. But we did discover as companies who own the brands that were losing audience were very fearful of losing their audience because that's their blood. At the boardroom of these companies, not at the bottom level but at the very top level, innovative people were asking the CEOs of these companies, what are you doing about the internet? When they looked around they decided they would call some people. We were only one of the few people you could call. In 95 we changed our business model to building entertainment for corporate customers and they became these things called websites that you know about today. We created all the entertainment ourselves as well as the backend systems necessary to deliver it because there were no existing platforms on the internet. We created without realizing it online databases, online catalogs, integration with legacy systems like SAP and legacy computer systems and that's how I was educated in the world of hardware and software. We took that company public in 1996 built that by 1999 to 150 million in revenue and we did 500 million in internet advertising sales between 96 and 99 and sold that which I retired and tried to help a lot of other companies as an advisor. Not as good as one as Ray has been to me I guess. But those companies did okay. Started a business again every six months I met up with my same partner from that original company. We decided that now was the time to try something different. This is about two years ago and the first move we made was to not make the original mistakes we made. Our motto was not the same mistakes only new mistakes. One of the early mistakes I made was bad board and fortunately through some relationships we were able to meet guys like Ray who have changed that one through a positive for us. Well that's pretty impressive for both of you. Now you've lived these parallel non-intersecting lives. How did you end up meeting? So through a mutual acquaintance the jury right so a partner at Barristerns called me one or sent me an email. I guess sent a couple of us at Cliner Perkins an email and I read all my email myself I don't have it you know builder or anything like that and so I was going through this one day and I said this is interesting podcasting the world of podcasting I don't know if I actually was I really wasn't in the podcasting wasn't thinking about but the idea itself I thought this could be intriguing depending on what these guys are doing with it and so I don't know I don't know how fast I responded to but it was in reasonable time I said you know let's find out some more about this and I may have asked one of our associates to do that but but basically I took a personal interest in it and saying I think this could be interesting and and reached out and said once you come you know send me a plan or come in and see me I can't remember exactly what it was something like that and and so that's you know that's how we know. So this is a unique opportunity we have to have the entrepreneur and the VC who invested them sitting in the same room and we can hear the story from both of you what was the process like of making that decision to invest or your decision to let them invest you know was this a long drawn out process was there a lot of vetting that went on maybe you could each tell a little bit of your perspective on what happened. Well he just told a very vanilla story of how we met which I thought was pretty good and and nicely done. When we decided to raise money there's two things that happened when you decide to raise money you give up control of the process or you take control of the process and that's where your life changes either one can work but if you give up control you surrender and get to someone else we had a little more experience so we decided to maintain control we made a list of the people not the agencies or groups or investors we wanted to speak with but the individuals from the top firms that we thought we might speak to all in the East Coast that's who I knew at that time. The gentleman on mutual acquaintance said why don't you try Silicon Valley and I said well I've been out there a few times totally do not relate to us they don't understand media they think of everything as an enterprise. Ron was living in Miami. I was living in Miami most of my work had been done on the East. This gentleman in the middle said you should just write down on the list of people you'd like to speak to and Ray Lane I wrote on that list I said this is a guy who's run businesses he made big decisions he's taken turn around he's he's he's encountered in his world the same thing I've encountered in my world I would rather have his advice in some other media guy who has worked part-time for AOL and thinks now they're a media guru so we sent out these emails to the top six firms only and only to the individuals in those firms the individuals 100% the six came back and said yes we'd like to meet with you and all of them turned it over to an assistant where upon I sent back an email I said no thank you if I wanted an assistant I would have called your assistant I'm only interested in you and no problem we'll see in next time around except for Ray Lane Ray Lane took it upon himself to see some of this dialogue and said you know I I feel something's going on here if you'll make the trip I'll give you the time and my partner myself came out here and presented to Ray and the people he bought in the room but we focused from the day one the filtering process for us was to find a person who understood what was going on in his organization that we could count on to make a rapid decision for us yes or no was fine but all that Googley MOOC that's in the books for me he doesn't work too well we just wanted to find a powerful thinking person inside their organization and we were very very fortunate he did not tell me I was being targeted hit I had no idea yeah I had no idea but the Saul came out after we made the investment and he said you know I let me tell you the story so that's why I heard that story is after we invested and he said I really wanted because he didn't realize Ron had as much experience in kind of the IT world in the software world so I thought he was coming from a world both he and Adam from the kind of media music entertainment world and I didn't think had a lot of familiarity with the kind of IT so I didn't talk a lot about I mean to me I didn't think Oracle had much you know relevance and you know in all the world I competed in and it turns out he knew everything there was to know about me and he said I you know I think this would be a good fit and and so I and and it has been it has been a great fit what I saw on the other side was I had seen probably two or three podcasting company were just starting to get interested in this this whole world of podcasting which is now morphed its way into something much much bigger it's not about podcasting but it's seen a couple of early stage venture one out of campus here and most of these well all of these ventures were young entrepreneurs who had were engineers and it focused on producing a directory or some kind of service that allow you to find podcasts and maybe even make a few of them they were way beyond that so there were two things they to them the directory and the tools necessary to build a podcast were almost commodities to get to a an endgame and both of them came from the business so they knew the end game they knew the endgame was entertainment the endgame was to build audience to to insert advertising and all that but not it wasn't a technical thing it wasn't a you know I'm going to design it and build it and they will come it was much more we understand how this business works and the internet is simply a medium for what by which we create or shift audience and and we really like that a pro that that's what I saw that said this is it rather than you're kind of you know engineering approach or computer science approach to building a directory or you know some kind of a podcasting service well maybe that's a good time for you to tell us a little bit more about you know pod show and what you're trying to do I spent some time on the site exploring and it was very entertaining and I'd love to know sort of where you are in the stage of development where you see it going and sort of what your vision for this is okay in 9 in 2004 I made a statement that was within five years over 50% of all content consumed would be created by other consumers so this is what I call the 550 prediction and it and it is coming true faster than I had predicted and other people had talked about it but what happens is that's a sea change and one of the things Ray and I relate to is what what events happen in society or culture that create ripples in communication or ripples in health or ripples in in in history of any kind and this is a big big change in the way entertainment works. Ron told me this before anybody ever heard of YouTube or my space or you know I guess we had invested in a social networking company we invested in the friendster but it's still we you know we weren't focused on user generated content as much as when you kind of said that's what it's going to be and of course we didn't believe you but I have to interrupt apparently one of you has a cell phone on that's on and it's interfering with the studio on it's being able to hear. Oops sorry. So I just got word from our technical team. Great thanks. Sorry. You know what if they don't scream and yell is it fine now? We're okay now. Okay thanks. That could have been another deal. A missed opportunity. It was a competitor don't worry. Okay so go on. Podcho believes that we at Podcho believe that there's a new ecosystem necessary to take advantage of this sea change in the way entertainment is created and consumed and then and that ecosystem will not be incredibly different from entertainment as we know it today but requires a fresh start a restart a reboot and the pieces of that ecosystem are a platform for the creation and delivery of the stuff that's something that all engineers seem to understand that is a price of admission not really that much of a differentiator but a methodology for having people put that content on there which is called a license which is something few engineers correctly understand willing content creators who will give license to you for you to do something with their content audience who believes that that content is valuable and therefore consumes it and advertisers who trust you to create to piggyback them on the relationship between the audience and the content I just described any media ecosystem you would ever point at so we believe that we need to create that whole ecosystem some of it give it away and figure out where we stood in that pile and where we think we stand where we stand today is we want to be the place you can go to find the very best content on the internet we're going to create enough of it ourselves so that you we feel that we can offer you five or ten choices in every category you're going to be able to get content on our site or through us whether we have advertising rights or not any content from anywhere in the world will pass through the advertising of other people and you can create your own collect your own or share your own that's the vision of Pacho today it's a really competitive landscape now it depends on who your competitors are yeah it's interesting who do you see is the biggest competitors and you know do you watch really closely what they're doing and are you kind of in lockstep or people taking big leaves what what's going on well I believe that in an emerging market that the majority of competition is low-hanging fruit so what you really want to do is look where you want to be and what you want to displace so we look at our competition is Rupert Murdoch or Time Warner and we aim at that level because the competition for us is for the audience right so we need to entertain our audience we need to acquire our audience and we need to give them something that other people aren't giving them if that's who your customer is our customer is our audience our customers not our advertiser our customers not our podcaster and we are obligated to bring the best content and experience in the world to that audience and if you live by that then you go against other people whose customers are their audience and you get into the media companies of the world so that's kind of where our landscape is that's pretty competitive but the trends of the mass Exodus trends from traditional media give us an influx of opportunity that really really is an amazing opportunity so I'm pretty blessed so Pacho is doing far more creating far more than we ever thought they would it this you know we keep saying at board meetings around focus focus focus you're doing far too much and there is a strategy behind it but I think from the description run just gave it is I think the the audience here could take away the impression of well if I want a podcast I could probably find it on Pacho and I could download it or if I want a you know a video I could I can maybe go there but obviously there's other places to get video and I think if you could describe the kind of the social networking part of it the kind of you know come to the network and share and be it you know the kind of the social media concept that you so if you and I don't want to sell it because I just invite everybody to go try it send me an email what you think Ron at Pacho so don't worry about the selling part if if you if you if you are a member of the internet today when when the internet started you went to destinations today you know there's a trend where the destined where you bring your destination with you you come with your profile you come with your identity but what's changed in the last year or so is that the way that you express your identity is no longer with some text now it's with some pictures and now it's with music that you like and now it's with something that you create it's coming to be also with what you collect so a combination of a person wanting to express themselves through the content that they influence and collect along with a confluence of content out there is what we are social media network lest you're me I you look at my profile is pretty boring it's pretty bad you're obviously very passionate about what what's going on at Pacho and how do you know working together I mean it's what's a typical dynamic between the entrepreneur and the investor and as a board member what how does that relationship work on a day-to-day or week-to-week I think it's I think it's my first of all I I confuse I get confused with whether I'm a venture guy or an operating guy I mean I I don't think whatever a venture capitalist does I guess I do it but I that's not how I think about the company okay so I and I think most of my partners think the same way we think about building companies as opposed to investing in companies so right from the beginning we're thinking about how do we advantage this company into a big market okay and make sure that it it just obliterates its competition and so how do we build the right team how do we advantage it by giving really really good people how do we make the right connections so how do we you know call the right people give them influence have you know have you heard of what well you probably don't know what Pacho is doing but let me explain it to you and might be interesting partnership for you to open doors for them but basically everything is around providing advantage to Pacho to win this market in this market being a combination of social and media so sharing your what you like with who you want to share it with and so if you know if you have a profile on Pacho and you want to share it with your friend or the friend wants to know what is it you're interested in these days what do you actually watch and listen to you can share it with them like sharing like you're a network and you know of yourself you are on the network and I can so I can see it by digging you you dig me and you can basically share now not just simply you know text exchange or pictures or you know go go this I saw this interesting video go download you know go look at it you can basically you're sharing your your life with people you want to share it with and that becomes a social network for music video and podcast I want to mention I'm going to ask just a few more questions and then open up the questions to the audience so make sure you start thinking about your questions now because you certainly will have an opportunity to ask them so the company is just really still growing and very new in this space what do you anticipate happening over the next few years what's what's the vision and the vision related to how you work together does your role end up changing as the company gets more traction before Ron talks about the vision I think he's best out of vision let me tell you about the astounding results so we we got to know each other about a year and a half ago or over a year ago over a year ago and we thought in a one year what can you accomplish you're gonna develop a lot so we have to provide the tools we have to get the facilities necessary to handle the volume that we expect to to come to the site you know we in no way predicted video it would be as big as it it was there was this thing called pod safe music if you're not if you haven't delved into that world of basically artists that make incredible music that are not signed by a label it's it's amazing and Ron's taught me everything about that but in one year basically pod shows been able to put up on the network about three thousand shows four thousand shows five thousand and every time I talk to him it like you know so five thousand shows these are podcasters that make their own content they basically make a daily weekly monthly show that that is you know ten minutes to an hour long and about all sorts of content you can look at so so five thousand shows sixty million downloads a month and and and advertisers that are big brand name advertisers that are now moving large portions of their advertising budget over to this new media world and it and it's just way beyond my expectations to have been for this team to have accomplished that in one year now he doesn't think it's enough he he thinks that the next step we keep saying you know release it release it let it go let let's if you've been able to do sixty million downloads and get that many shows let's just let it go and let's let's get in the millions and you know and and and and and and and really blows and and that's where the this vision comes of Ron's saying not yet coach not yet we're we're about to do it because they have built some of the best facilities for video podcasting and music so you can get high quality content and great user generated content on this site but the payoff is when you can now start putting it all together so you can now talk about the future wow that's why I'm lucky first of all he mentioned I call him the coach and for those of you that are interested in a board member I think you have to set us set of expectations for board members by planning on your dream board member writing down the questions you want to ask ask them and I have I know none of my board members prior prior to their investment in this company which is unusual and I wrote as a rule you know the kill clause in our investment that Ray had to stay on the board because Ray is an operator for me not that experienced in media but a voracious consumer of something new and a person that when you have to grow you have you're struggling you're trying to make a decision a higher or a fire take money don't take money a riskier company to go to the left to right it's a person you want to ask and and it doesn't matter if the background is from a different world or the same world that experience is is unprintable and anything else you won't find here at this campus it's just the comes from people we've made an acquisition already so that was a decision had to be made fast executed fast diligence done fast get it done get it behind it's it's a huge diversion for a team that's trying to build some something this this fast and why would a small company acquire I mean it makes no sense for most people was the acquisition for technology or people or content plan for technology platform and speed market so on that note give us a picture of the company how many people are there what are they doing what's the breakdown of how many people in technology development how many people in marketing the sales how many doing content development what's two years ago it was a blank startup without an office we used to say our office within Skypill and we had six employees that we'd never met all hired virtually on the internet all six of them still work the for the company full-time when we met Ray and the team and raised money out here we decided to headquartered in San Francisco rather than New York or Los Angeles media capital because we thought we'd stand at a better a better chance we stood a better chance to be a media capital provider right here so here we're kind of big fish we know this business as good as anyone out in this area we now have a hundred people in our office here in San Francisco up in Soma and another 50 to a hundred scattered around the globe we have a sales office in New York and a sales and production office in London we have a distribution deal with British Telecom their exclusive distributor in the UK so if you go to Pajoyo UK it'll actually be BT Pajoyo we have a platforms rolling out from mobile and IPTV which I think Ray was alluding to taking the internet as the centerpiece of creating and building the model for controlling and distributing content and using if the audiences indeed are customer we have to go get them with our content where they live so it's a relatively fast growth we did about 50-60 million downloads in December we're growing about 32% month over month and downloads the revenue we anticipated for 2007 we did in Q4 of 2000 now the revenue we anticipated for 2006 we did in Q4 of 2005 so we're pretty much ahead of revenue we're also ahead of spend don't be shocked to go to a board meeting and someone says what happens if we spend more money can you grow faster and don't be afraid to say well wait a minute which Ray is talking about and then they say well slow down and you're going speed up so I have a dynamic with Ray I think is very important kind of a mutual admiration that's a speed up on the top line and slow down on the bottom and there's rules you know I call the 210 rule you make you make you have five or six people seven people in the company you stress you stress if you have a product that's good at all and you really care about making money maybe you generate a million and a half to two million bucks and then you think wow now I need to hire two more engineers but now I need someone to answer the phone if I get the engineers whoops if I need someone to answer the phone then I probably lost my assistant now I need an assistant oh by God I need someone to help with the finance better turn the sales over and all of a sudden you got to go make 10 million before you see the light of day so we're trying to blow past those decisions those are cycles we've seen we have some experience and just focus our focus is on where our customer is going and our customer which is you is moving really really fast you're not doing the same thing you were six months ago you're not doing the same thing you were you don't consume like you did three months ago every day you're discovering a new site every day you're discovering some new widget or some new way to do something and we have to stay at pace with you to such extent that when you want to lean back a little bit and gather yourself together that you'll think about pod show right well what do you spend your typical day doing obviously this is things are moving so quickly that probably isn't a typical day but you know is it management is it strategic thinking is it well we have a lot of white boarding and we're a little bit farther along now but you start with the holy triumvirate of product you know sales and service you keep messing with them so now we have we're divided into sales marketing and biz dev I have a guy that runs that and we have a product and engineering which are married in our company which is interesting and then we have production which helps create the content those three groups come together in something we call rotation which is very interesting the rotation is the process by which we acquire content promoted through our network use it to spin up delight in the audience kick it out the other end to meet an advertiser this is a media approach so we're we spend most of our day managing that rotation meeting after meeting and then once every couple of weeks we hit the road with the sales and the sort of solicitation and then when I first met Ray I was actually thinking man this is gonna be bad I'm gonna have to go you know once a week I'm gonna have to go and make a report and boy this is gonna be a drag because this is Ray Lane and he got to be wanting these reports so I kind of slipped into his office I said okay coach you know now we're signed up we got the money we're going so you want to do it every every Wednesday and he goes what and I you know the meeting that you're gonna want with me is it every Wednesday goes are you crazy come call me up when you have something to talk about because it by the third Wednesday we're gonna have nothing to talk about you realize I ran a $10 billion company without ever doing an operational review I love this ever so I call Ray you know I and every time I have a thought that is interesting that I want to bounce off somebody even just to find another direction which I call English just to spin off Ray and go in another direction or just direct input I'll usually call him so he's my primary contact across the board and the guy that I suck the energy out of most of all of our board members so you one of the questions that we ask our students is you know when you build and think about building a new company do you do you want to think about it is something that's built to last or built a flip is this something when you started you know that you think about the exit strategy at the beginning never do none of our companies we think about an exit strategy so every company we invest in if it's not gonna be built to last if it's not going to be an IPO and so that represents some kind of exit but we're gonna build it to last that is first priority if we invest in large markets we really large markets with a huge network effect so it builds a large company our investors will be just it will be fine they'll be happy but they end up the investors our limited partners Stanford of which is one are actually lower priority than our entrepreneurs our partners our families and I would say that in front of which I just did in front of our investors because they will make they know they'll make money if we build large-ustaining companies like Sun or Compact or Google Origin and Tech or the you know Jupiter and Juniper and well I guess that this audience probably is filled with a lot of questions so I want to open it up to those in the audience and we'll see what the students have to say so what was it about Ron or and or about Pots out of the deal record for you as far as and we need to repeat the question for the other so what what was I see a lot of ventures come across my desk and what was it that was interesting about Potshow why did that make the difference it really was a combination of the what their vision of how they thought this business was going to evolve and they were half right they were half right but they were twice as right as anybody else I met now I can look back two years I didn't know at the time at the time I thought they were a hundred percent right because they were in the second reason they were media guys they were entertainment guys that understood that the technology is simply a medium to get to that end that end goal and so so that that made sense so we so we a big determinant for us is do we bet if we know we want to be in this market back then called podcasting okay podcast interesting we don't use the term podcasting anymore pod is in our name but simply because we like the name pod show but the pod casting represents an audio feed that you can get through some kind of RSS or subscription service and all that we do much more than 90% of our businesses video now a lot of its music and so it is much more a social network well these guys have have watched the entertainment delivered and how it's evolving to young people although I think the average age of our audiences in the young 30s right depends on this program okay okay so but but it's going to be primarily young people that are aware of this so you have to watch how that evolves and change with it so we've blended video video became very very important and if we do you know so from a entertainment perspective you got to do what the audience is buying what is the audience listening to what are they tuning into if you're not going to be aware of that then forget it I didn't see how how a young team that was developing technology for podcast directories and content creation how they were going to understand that as well as these two Adam and Ron so so that made the huge difference to me thank you both for coming first out I was wondering what have what type of conflicts of interest have you seen as we see in founder and what's up with the most strain on your relationship what type of conflicts of interest you know I actually I can't think of any that we because we would never we would never invest in a competitor of Pacha we don't invest in any any competitors of company we've already invested in so that there would be no business conflicts where you where you typically run into conflicts is if you take money from someone who would invest in a competitor and if it takes them a long time to decide they're not going to invest in a competitor then I would suggest you think about that how what that means to you ray in his team and his company and his group they stand for something so you know what they stand for the second time is in valuation and discussions about valuation but if you describe your company well enough and defend your vision well enough and you're also fair enough to the other side and that doesn't conflict if you raise ongoing rounds that's where you also can run into conflict I just think if you set it up at the beginning right if you do a little work homework about what's going to happen in the future you sort of anticipate the dialogue and you talk with your investor what's going to happen if this happens what do you think about this also if you're honest with yourself if you're hitting the wall somewhere and you what you thought what happened is not happening as well you want to you want to have an investor who's a partner and I think we've already we've gone to a bunch of those intersections together and I think that we just got a pretty good feel for each other and trying to have some integrity so generally there are there are no conflict of interest I'll give you one small thing that that could be could occur all the time from the venture business if you're in early your early stage venture investor you're taking you know the most risk I mean so you're you're investing when the tech we still technical risk in the company and so typically you're looking for a lot of ownership for a reasonable amount of investment if you're fortunate enough a lot of companies basically get modest you know say their series B get a modest uptick in valuation because they're coming maybe out of technical risk they got you know one customer to try to beta or something like that you know but in this case pod show their series B had a huge up uptick in valuation and so I've got to look at my job now I've got a bit of a conflict because on one side I've got to support the company and so he wants to be able to go out to other investors and say Clienter Perkins is behind me and Clienter Perkins is investing and they still believe in the company and even though the valuation is relatively high they believe so much that they're going to make money that they're going to invest at this high valuation when in fact my venture side says we already own a lot of the company and it's smart of us to not take our pro rata because even though it will make money we might make less than the 10 or 15 x that we're looking for on the early money and so I've got to balance those two things in a bit of a conflict but but but we did invest yes I'm wondering how the new ideas and solutions that's driving the new video business model strategies do you go out and search for them find them yourself or are they coming to you like being is there are sort of interesting things out of being attracted to you coming to you without an effort is that the fact well the question do we attract business opportunities exactly and do you are are they good so do you go out and find them or they there's a lot of stuff coming to you now very very important in my mind as a business person to magnetize your company and we very successfully attempt attempted to magnetize our company to four constituents advertisers we made a decision only global brands so if we decide it's nice to say we're going to do advertising but if we would have determined not to take only global brands but the first brands in would have been crap brands then the difficulty in attracting global brands would have been monumental is even the YouTube and my space are experiencing today so we have a 60 global brands and basically no crap brands on our network at a cost of revenue that was a decision we made by having that group of global brands we magnetize ourselves to more global brands we magnetize ourselves to audience by passing through content even if we don't own it and passing through other people's advertising to make sure our audience is comfortable a lot of people would say only our stuff on our network to magnetize to the producers we try to give the top level producers a way to make the most money and everybody gets access to the network for free so that's nice the to magnetize ourselves to engineers interestingly enough was a hardest part for me because until we grew to a certain extent we were bootstrap in the kind of talent we wanted to bring in because we're defining an entirely new mental design engineering market space so the DNA is really likes to say of our company really lean toward the media side and the biggest challenge was leadership in engineering we had a plenty of good rank and file and 70% of our company is in development product but to find the right leadership we understood what we're doing is it's been an ongoing the most challenging of those four I say two things if you walk into pod show you don't see your standard Silicon Valley company you see people developing content you see people you know figuring out how it will be listened to and how it'll be integrated and everybody's on headphones and everybody's watching I mean it's just it's a very interactive live open-pit environment for the way this the way this works the second day is you know it is when he when Ron first mentioned advertisers that a lot of these global brands bring really boring advertising so if you take advertising off of television or radio and try to put it into this medium it doesn't work and Ron and Adam are strong enough to say you know we don't want we want your brand but let us help you develop cool advertising that people will listen to because if you just take you know like the CEO of Damien or Chrysler remember when he went on TV and he was doing these ads and so I'm the you know he thought that was really cool it just wouldn't play on on pod show and so you have to have so we actually have gotten into things like user generating advertising but for the first time I understand the super bowl is actually going to have some user generated ads Ron was doing that a year ago for earth link earth link had some really boring ads and good company but but they had a contest in fact Adam show on Adam show had a contest for this lasted quite a bit of time to make advertising for a link and the you know number one and number one ad you know the one the one they they started using so they're sounding a lot cooler well now my favorite thing to do is set up Ron with some of the you know I know a lot of CEOs in Fortune 500 companies that have maintained relationships with and I say you know they say we're getting into this podcasting stuff you know we mentioned we've invested in a pod show pod show or podcasting company we're getting to that we're doing a lot of podcasting you know Tina said we're doing a lot of podcast podcasting here it's it's damper and if you let Ron look at your podcasting chances are he will tell you why it is probably not other than just simply script that's put on you know some kind of digital media and streamed you know it's not entertaining it's got to be entertaining if it goes into pod show including ads the ads have to fit the entertainment you know kind of genre and so I think a big contribution pod show is going to make is to the development of advertising advertising as content that you want to listen to you know it's the same way we low we we will what a lot of us watch the Super Bowl just for the ads right and it's that it's that concept this year we were one of our biggest advertisers is GoDaddy we created 60 they they value a lifetime value of two to five hundred dollars per customer four months we created 60 thousand customers for them that's a pretty interesting campaign so we like them they like us they got a great product which is why we can sell it and they're open-minded about how we sell it they offered us an opportunity to influence their Super Bowl ad the last Super Bowl ad we influence was 1995 where we put two ads in the Super Bowl one for Oracle and we had fun then but we thought it was old old school to influence a Super Bowl ad now it doesn't make sense for us everybody's doing it so if everybody's doing user generated fake Super Bowl ads we don't want to do that we have to find something else to do one of the greatest joys in the world as an entrepreneur is the ability to say no and the minute you start saying yes to everybody and and thinking there's a solution for everything you really mess in yourself up because you get no respect in the community and what you're operating so we we spend a lot of time we're very proud of it telling advertisers no no I understand that's how you want to do it but our audience won't accept it and sometimes we say I tell you what we'll run your camp will let us do the campaign we'll run it for free if you don't like it don't pass you can do a few of those sometimes we say we will not accept your advertising and they'll come back in a month or a week or a year and double up so you know just on the advice side to have a little bit of self-esteem about the brand and the product that you push out to feel good about what you're doing is a passion that communicates to the people to which you're gonna sell your advertising well I have a philosophy to go ahead you repeat the question how do we scale up if you are exercising editorial constraint here you know why do you exercise constraint in a marketplace because of the fact which is it was selling links which is driving many cases down the value of advertising and created a cpm market we looked at that market and realized that that is a really good market for creating a baseline relationship but a really bad market for creating a branding relationship so we said if that's a bad market who's gonna have the good markets well we think we have a pretty good market can we defend that claim yes we have 50 million downloads we have loyal users top 20% of our network does 80% of our downloads which means we have deep lasting relationships we hit them again and again it's not a one-off and one-off so we go to a brand and we say we go with the mentality that we want the brands to compete to be on our network that will scale when you have 55 billion dollars worth of advertising spend television and radio and it's and the audience is decreasing a 30% per year so there's the economies of inverse economies of scale driving a decision-making process our gamble is that brands are going to want to connect with their audience and if we can keep the quality of advertising there's no law that says advertising somewhere in the last 30 years advertising and content bifurcated and if you go back and study radio and television it's the slot law that changed it 24 minutes a programming six minutes of advertising syndication if you if all of you study up on that it's very interesting the internet says we don't need that formats are or transportable and transmutable we can incorporate advertising anyway we want which gives advertising a chance to become content again brands realize that before advertising agencies so you start by showing case studies to do half a billion dollars in internet advertising as one company and still have people lined up in the outside the door for example it's not going to be a problem we also do our sales with a very small sales force increasingly large numbers for smaller entire brands music to my ear we got a way to go but we're working all right well the audience you want to know how do we understand of content has is good quality well the social media network in itself promotes what they think is what they think is good and identifies what they think is interesting so content is good or interesting for a variety of reasons like life is this is this piece of content is good for today because it's topical and it's stupid and I'm going to dispose of it but on the other hand this show is really interesting and I'm going to dedicate 30 minutes of my week each week to consuming it we believe you should serve this music is great so I'm going to follow this artist all of that is in our content ecosystem but the top most powerful content on our network is led by shows and shows are what some people will call podcasts but it is serialized content so the audience out of the forty almost five thousand shows on our network the top three hundred really do the meat of the business we watch the other four thousand or so and we see what's beginning to percolate as something look good or interesting based on audience response or our intuition qualitative and quantitative be driven we sick ourselves on that property as we call it that media property and attempt to develop it so we give as the as the shows and programs are learning from each other we also try to inject some fuel into them we can also promote them across our network so it is a qualitative and quantitative process that seems to be working now we also produce directly produce forty or fifty shows and and directly produce about two hundred shows that we watch the company and I think of another non media companies like you know Apple see jobs approval with sir gay and Larry thinking about it sort of how do you brand a company a lot of that has to do with what people perceive the company as and how they perceive make the leadership of that company and just very secret comment at all about where you see yourself as a leader and how you make your leadership style influence the company where I see myself as a leader and how do I think my leadership style I want to say that I absolutely agree with your take that I believe in any company leadership has the opportunity to to highly influence the way the company has perceived I think my number one role is vision I have to be able to articulate it and I have to be able to demonstrate it in a way that's typically at odds with the rest of the world so I have to look for outspoken arrogant ways to talk about the vision of the company but if I'm lucky or fortunate or good or have good advice I have to preload those statements with some sort of proof of concept that let's me back up what I'm saying so just when people are getting irritated by the position outcomes in the case study and then another position in another case study and my partner out of myself every speck of clothing every photo opera every turn down of a speech every acceptance of a place every single thing every message he does on his show he has a show and I do not everything we do is calculated not always gets the response we want controversy is great understanding it ray is getting a great experience in how that works in the beginning we used to have a little controversy call me right about about the third time they go hey this controversy stuff pretty cool you know people are complaining about pod show and it's like they don't get it no that's that was planned ray don't worry about so you in a media company that's important but also I think that this translates to any type of business you have to you have to understand that just because you believe in what you're doing maybe I've seen a lot of entrepreneurs that don't want you peel away the onion but let's assume that you do that somehow everybody else is busy and pod show has missions our mission is to be a board to move the share price of our customers our advertisers to to be a boardroom decision you know right now a couple of years that won't matter anymore but right now in an early stage company you want to strive you want to know where you can fall in the meter and for us it's really really important for someone to look at us and go if I work with those guys my personal success in my company is better and I'm gonna I'm gonna make the big move from my company if not they're gonna do time Warner they're gonna do well they're gonna do Yahoo they're gonna do Google so I can't compete with those guys I have to differentiate us and as a leader I try to do that from my staff we try to bring in culture that they help create which we we are a family we had a hundred and a hundred people we had 175 people attend our employee party a Christmassy we didn't invite any any even board members really we just kind of kept it a Christmas I should say we break every Friday for Foubaar Friday this is something my partner I have done for three companies now if anybody's Dutch there's a word that I can't pronounce called bullia which is this Dutch drinking thing that they do on Friday which we stole from a business over there everybody gets together outcomes the beer and wine and food and we talk we have a different version of stand-up meetings we do everything we experiment with different ways internally we put employees first and ask employees to put family first and we drive everybody like Taipei so it's kind of what we are the bad board so we described this work to different states bad board from good board bad board from good board and one other thing a great example is when we were building the company and I was trying to find the right leadership and engineering I talked to Ray and I said how do we how do we do it what are we what are we missing and what are we doing here and he said something that I use all the time which is the first 10 or 20 people in the organization put a DNA stamp on the organization and that permeates your next growth whatever it is to thousands or hundreds of thousands so we tried to keep a hole around the lead of engineering to hold off that DNA decision for as long as possible until we just hired a guy that they vetted from me that I don't know if anyone else could handle this guy but they vetted him in five minutes he Ray called me up his hire him I don't care what it takes because he understood our DNA that's a great example of getting some input from a board I the public company board we had we were busy already we were very aggressive we were growing not that they were bad people but it was more like a rubber stamp you talk and they would give some advice and the advice would be many of the things my here in school you know make sure you stay focused are you sure you're not doing too many things at once how is those how's that cash flow going you know all that kind of stuff you know if you need the board to ask you that you're probably in a little bit of trouble if you haven't had experience in running a company then those are really interesting questions our board is a healthy debate we have a couple of guys that are more esoteric they dream John Doors a very interesting board member it was pod show podcast network he would say it's not about it's not about the audience it's about the pot it's about the cast then it was it's not about the cast it's about the pod then it was it's not about the pod it's about the show and then he said okay we're not in Kansas anymore but on the other hand if you get into talking about where we can go and what the big vision is he reacts Ram Shurama's on our board is a very interesting gentleman ramen Ray have a great dynamic they work they know that they can tell us hit us right between the eyes I think also and we'll react we spend a lot of time we give three hours or so to a board meeting and they take three hours and it's and we come prepared and we discuss topics and it goes left and it goes right at the end we've got it done three hours okay four hours we show a lot we ask a lot so in general the camaraderie of the board with each other is important also from an advisory capacity I can call any board member on our board and probably get to anyone in the universe and there's board members smart enough to know to advise me maybe it's a little too soon and I think I'm smart enough not to ask before it's too soon like what I see a lot of young companies do is Ray Lane knows the head of ABC why don't you go talk to him well I asked myself her why don't you go talk to him I asked myself well what would I say I don't have anything to say to her yet so now I park in the back of my mind boy if I had five minutes with the head of ABC what would I say and I got to build a company to get to the point to have that discussion so knowing that we basically all I have to do now is build the company to the get to the intersection to talk to the person and somewhere on this board they'll give me access to that person is really really the definition of the type of board that I like. Eight percent of board meetings and it's board meetings are not all that important it's the interaction you have between board meetings and make decisions around individuals and any decision but board meetings are 80% spent on the product spent on the you know actually what the company it could be a staff meeting actually and 20% is on you know stuff we have to do just as a business as any business would do but 80% of it is content that we're reviewing looking at fun stuff that's been developed since the last they're fun good fun board meetings. Well can you believe we ran out of time and I'm sure all of you can agree this was an incredible treat I think this was really fabulous and I learned a tremendous amount and if you want to listen to it again and again you can go listen to our podcast of this talk and all the other on-fraile thought leader lectures at our website which is the edcorner.stanford.edu and I want to thank you so much. Can I make one more comment hopefully we're still on but go to podshow.com okay and just go to podshow.com and if you have you know something really you know critical to say you know please send it to Ron or send it to me if you want to send it to me. I have something really complimentary to say it's a right. You know just anything that helps because you you know the diversity in this room and on this network would be tremendous to get the feedback from and there's nothing like a new user nothing a new audience to kind of look at it and say you know you know I I don't get why you did it this way you know and it just would be helpful now if you just say it's great and I love it and I'm staying that's you say that too yeah that's great thank you. I do have a presentation for you. On behalf of BASIS and S.T.V.P we'd like to thank Ray and Ron for giving us great insight into a company and it's the best day.
