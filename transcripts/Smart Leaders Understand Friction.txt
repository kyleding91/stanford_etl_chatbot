 This is the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series brought to you by Stanford Equal. Welcome everybody to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders seminar. We have a very special ETL this week and I suspect that the next 50 minutes are going to fly by. But I also hope there will be certain moments when you slow down and really take in some of the salient wisdom that will be shared. That modulation of time slowing things down and speeding things up by adding or reducing friction is at the heart of what we're going to be talking about today. And we are commemorating not just two amazing speakers but also the launch of a book that captures these takeaways which is called the friction project. And you can get that book on the QR code that you see to my left. And also if you're listening to this via the podcast, if you go to bob Sutton.net, you'll also find ample information for that. This topic on friction is so wide in its scope and it's also the two speakers that we have, the adoration for them is so deep. That we are trying something new this week at ETL that we've never done before. We're going to have two fireside chat leaders with Bob and Huggy. So Emily Ma and myself are going to be the fireside chat leaders and today we have two very beloved guests, Bob Sutton and Huggy Raab. Bob is I think the most popular guest we have ever had on ETL. I think Bob, I think this is Bob's seventh time. If it's the seventh, sixth, I can't remember. Or seventh time on ETL and I think by far he is the most frequent speaker that we have invited back to ETL. And I hope you'll all see why in a second. But for those who, how many people have heard of Bob or taking one of Bob's classes? All right. So Bob is an organizational psychologist and professor of management science and engineering in the engineering school here at Stanford. He's given keynote speeches to more than 200 groups in 20 countries and served on numerous scholarly editorial boards. Bob's work has been featured in the New York Times, Business Week, the Atlantic, more publications than I can mention here, including End of Washington Post. He's a frequent guest on various television radio programs and has written eight books, including scaling up excellence, the no-asshole rule, good boss, bad boss, two edited volumes. And also the upcoming friction project, which along with scaling up excellence, he has co-authored with Huggy Raab. And Huggy is the Athol-Bean Professor of Organizational Behavior at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Science, the Sociological Research Association, and the Academy of Management. He's written for Harvard Business Review, Business Week, and the Wall Street Journal. And is the author of Market Rebels and the co-author with Bob of both scaling up excellence and now to be launched on January 30th, the friction project. So please welcome Huggy and Bob to ETI. Thank you. Thank you so very much. So, gang, we're going to kick this off. You're part of the entrepreneurial thought leader seminar, and even though you are academics, you're also founders and creators of your own venture, which is this book amongst other books. And we love to start off ETI often times with understanding the origin stories. So I'd love to kick it off with you sharing your origin story of this venture of the friction project. You know, I love the fact that Ravi, you described the book as a venture. I would modify it just a little bit. It was more of an adventure for me. I mean, truly, it was something we surrogate into, with a frankly, a lot of forth thought in that sense. Because we've written a book called Scaling Up Excellence. You know, how do you take spread goodness in an organization? How do you take a venture from the startup scale and scale it up so that it becomes big and better as opposed to being dumb? And as we were presenting the material from the Scaling Up Excellence book, we discovered that the top echelons of leadership in a company or the senior echelons, they really loved the message. But as we went lower down, people loved the message. But they loved for the message came with a perennial lament. And the lament was, it's really hard to do anything or get anything done in my company. I'm going to give two bookends just to give you a sense of what we encounter. You know, I remember Bob and I asking an executive, a seemingly innocent question, where do you work? And the guy looks at us with a glint in his eye and he says, I work in a frustration factory. I just like, you know, man, how does this guy go to work in the first place? And then there's another young woman whom I can never forget. And she was kind of describing how she poured herself at work, doing busy work and largely in consequential work. And she said, I go home and all I left are scraps of myself for my family. That was like a blow to the solar plexus, I'd say. And that's how we said, hey, we really need to understand friction land in organizations. So I would add to that, I think there's also some personal elements, this I'll get to in a second. But our book, our 2014 book was on Scaling Up Excellence. And then we hang out with folks like Chris Yee, a blitz Scaling fam, and venture capitalist like Ravi here. Their dream is scale, baby scale. Let's make a unicorn. And there are various organizations that's like, I've been in the Stanford Engineering School for 40 years. I've seen a lot of startups come and go. And I won't mention Google. But let's take Facebook, which actually, I worked with them, but when they had between 200 and 400 people, I wasn't much help to them, but I had a lot of fun. And now they're like kind of a big dumb company in a lot of ways. And so what happens in the process and is we're interested in scaling, is that as organizations get large and complex, it's very hard for them to create places where it's still easy to get things done. And yes, we're not like, this is really important. Because there's some people who say, kill the bureaucracy. The bureaucracy must die. That's not us. Our perspective is a great book called Hackier Bureaucracy. I think that's all our perspective that is organizations get larger, more complex and older. They do need more process. They do need more specialization. They really do need hierarchy. But some are better than others. So that's sort of the personal part is that leading its scale is something that a lot of organizations, in my case, you did more stuff of Salesforce and I did more stuff with Microsoft. Those are examples of organizations where leading its scale is important, leading something big. And then let's get personal since we're at Stanford University. Since I have been here 40 years, things are so much harder to get done here than when I got here. It's just absolutely unbelievable. And one of the things that makes it harder, and I think many of you have probably seen the numbers, it's Stanford. We have, it depends how you calculate about the same number of administrators as we do of students. It depends how you count. And of course, administrators have to justify their existence. So what they do is they create things for us, the students and faculty to do, and for one another to do, to justify their existence. And to just give you kind of a little number. When I first got to the school of engineering, which now has about 20% more tenure track faculty than it did in 1983, there was only one person in the whole school named Ken Down who was a finance person or a money person. Now to survive the bureaucracy, everybody needs multiple money, finance people just to fight back just to get stuff done. And so they create work for one another and for us. And I think I'm not saying that there's too many of them, I'm saying it's a symptom. So that's both personal and by the way, our book, The First Paragraph, starts with a 1266 word email with a 7500 word attachment, inviting all 2000 faculty to spend a day brainstorming about the new door school, which I don't think was a good use of our time. So we start out. And I'm a Saturday. Well, I'm a Saturday, yes. And being the shy person I am, I sent it to Perseist Row, our then Provost, and said, really is this a good use of our time? So I did complain. But he couldn't resist editing that 1200 word email. Yeah, I did. And he quickly reduced it to 400 words and how long? A couple of minutes? A couple of minutes. But I'm not a chat GPT could do it in probably 10 seconds. So anyway, so that's the bad news. I think we can talk about good news too. It's not all pessimistic. It's actually a pretty optimistic book. But we started out grumpy. I think that's where I'd say. Do you want to talk about how co-authors have the good fight? Yeah, I don't want to do this because I feel like you two have a very unique partnership. Like writing a book as a solo author is already quite difficult. You've done this before, Bob. Yeah, yeah. So you two must have experienced friction just with the two of you. So let's start with that. Well, my main two co-authors, two books are Jeff Effer and Huggy Wout. Jeff, all we did was scream at each other. Honestly, and I still think that there's entire chapters of our books. Like he does have any children and he writes a chapter about work family stuff. He doesn't know what the hell he's talking about. I couldn't get him to take it out. But Huggy, it's currently opposite. I always try to get you to argue with me. And I get mad at you because you wouldn't argue with me enough. Well, actually the thing with Bob and I is, Bob usually is very improvisational. You know, likes to do many, many things. And I discovered the secret to collaborating with Bob is I had to get to that corner quicker than he did. So I'm the one who's improvisational, disorganized, generating ideas and Bob's the adult. And he keeps constantly telling me, why the fuck am I the adult in this relationship? I said you're very good at it. But the other thing you should also know is, while we argue about ideas, Bob is truly, he's of course a more gifted writer than I am because when Bob writes in each sentence, you can easily visualize a picture. You wouldn't believe it. There are times when we've spent three hours talking about the three words we are going to use. Can you imagine that? Three hours. That's a perfectly rational thing to me. I know. You know, should it be a verb? Should it be an adverb and all of these things? And I think what all of that does is, it really makes you think constantly about the reader. Is the biggest danger in writing a book is you can forget the reader? So one thing I would add about this process, I think is important. And how many of you have heard of the book Radical Candor by Kim Scott? Probably a lot. It's a great book. X Google Er. And so anyway, we had the same editor that she had for Radical Candor. His name is Tim Bartlett. In fact, Kim and I are doing a little interview thing with him at the end of the week if you want to see us in conversation. The thing I loved about Tim Bartlett, and I don't think how you could believe it, but I think that Tim Bartlett was even more compulsive about language than I did. So the number of times that Tim and I would do 11 emails over four words, like this sort of happened every few days. And I don't know whether it helped, but for me, that's my idea of fun. It's kind of sad, but that's my idea of fun. I'm glad you guys are talking about this, because you guys do have this power of distilled articulation. And the words that you have just stick. And so it's good to know that that doesn't come easy. I think that's one of the takeaways is that even with great tech products, the simplicity belies the work that's involved. And you know, Tim and a lot of people, Ravi, for example, they actually advised us and I got excited about the title. We originally wanted to call this book The Shit Fixers, because you know, a very crucial thing in any organization. I loved the name, and we discovered we even had a podcast called The Shit Fixers for a couple of weeks. And then we called our friends and said, hey, do you want to participate in a podcast called The Shit Fixers? They said it's a great name, but there's a small problem. And we'd say, what's the problem? My CEO won't let me participate in a podcast called The Shit Fixers. And we'd say, why? Well, we're fixing shit, but we don't want the world to know. We're full of shit. That was, that was, that David Kelly, you know, D-School Ideo famed. So he was our first guest on it. And David, I know David for a long time, and I'm walking to say it because I hate that name. I hate that name. And we'd have like a break in the recording and say, I hate that name. And then at the end, he said, I hate that name. So I really got the message that some people hated the name. And David is, he's generally got pretty good taste and is not easily offended. So yes, we did abandon The Shit Fixers. Is it? The No Ascle Rule took off, but Shit Fixers died. Yes. So here was the argument. So the No Ascle Rule is by far my best-selling book. Because the No Ascle Rule is actually about the No Ascle Rule and about workplace assholes. Shit Fixers means almost nothing, which I think Tim, our editor, made a good argument. So what does it mean? Like, is it everybody in every organization, is it their job to fix shit and not to create it accidentally? So he thought it meant absolutely nothing. Which I thought was a good argument. Well, let's, let's move forward. I want to talk about, you know, how this friction is not just relevant to big companies. Because I think our audience is also, we have a bunch of aspiring founders that might say, you know, all these problems are talking about friction or big organizations. That's not relevant to my life. What does friction look like through the lens of an aspiring founder? Ooh, ooh. So well, there's two parts that one is that you can sell a lot of stuff by making the right things wrong and the right things easier and the wrong things harder. That's the whole point of a lot of different apps and stuff is to make our life easier. So we know that. But there's also this notion that is organizations grow amazingly quickly, things get hard to do. And so, I start up, which probably none of you ever knew about called Pulse News, which was one of the first ones come up at the D-School. Anke and Akshay remember that? And what they sold it for a lot of money. Oh, it was one of the first apps on the apps. One of the very first apps. Yeah, one of the very first apps that, in fact, was all the story that got knocked off and Karris Wischer was involved in getting it back on. So these two guys Anke and Akshay, they start this company and we interviewed them. I remember in their office at downtown Palo Alto and I remember Anke said, when we move from three people to twelve people and we're all in one room, we were having all sorts of coordination problems and we were dropping balls and having confusion. So they broke just these twelve people into four different groups and then they added a little bit of rhythm. They had a standup meeting in the afternoon where people said, here's what I accomplished today, here's what I need help with. Classic engineering sort of one. But in that case, they had to have, if you think about it, they had to have some process and they had to have some division of the sort of focus because they had friction problems. You know, I think your question really made me think about how founders don't actually apply a friction lens when they're actually making decisions. Let me give you two sort of quick examples. At the graduate school of business, I teach a class called from start up to scale up and you know, with John Lilly, a great student of computer science and another guy called Suje Jaswa. And the other day in our class, we had Evan Williams, the founder of Twitter. So I asked him a simple question when we were having these discussions. I said, you know, when you started this company, who was your first hire? And he looks at all of us and says, well, I'm a product guy and I thought maybe I should hire somebody who has complimentary skill. You know, somebody who's kind of more, you know, go to market or enter or whatever. And interestingly, he said he called Ben Horowitz, whom all of you, I'm sure, no. And he asked Ben, what do I do? And Ben said, I think you should really hire another product person. And Evan says, why should I hire another product person as opposed to go to market person? And Ben looks at him and says, if you hire another product person who's similar to you, you're going to talk to that person much more frequently. And in a startup, when you're iterating your product and your product is not right, the first thing you got to do is you got to have a lot of conversations. So don't hire people with whom you're not going to have a conversation. And Evan hadn't thought of that. That's a simple example of if you will using a friction lens. Another way in which founders completely missed the boat on occasion with respect to friction is when they split founder equity. You know, most people when they split equity, they actually split it equally. You know, the four of us are doing a startup 25% to each of us. But that doesn't mean we're going to contribute equally over the course of the startup's life. Some people will contribute more, others will kind of contribute less. And it turns out that if you actually agree to equal startups, VCs may think you're a good team. But strong founders, if you ask them an year later, hey, what do you think about the founder equity? They say, man, that was really unfair. I work most of the time and these guys are collecting things for no reason. So even a thing like founder equity, you want to actually kind of make sure you take a friction lens and our recommendation would be, don't allocate the founder equity all amongst the founders at T0. Make some, keep some in reserve so that you give it to different people. If Bob raises more money than any of us, he ought to get like more of the equity. Ravi gets more customers or she helps with product. They should get more equity than me. And so you have that kind of flexibility and you have room for what's called dynamic contracting. Does the research, that's I think a really salient point that goes against conventional wisdom. So I just want to make sure that we, that I really capture the right takeaway. Does the research bear that out? That teams that have discretionary founder equity are outperform those that just treat everything? They have lesser post decision regret. They have less need to buy out people. And how large is there any sense of like of the equity, how much you should allocate? So this is where I think part of what you want to do is you don't want to go all in at T0. You want to keep a little bit of reserve. The other thing is since you're talking about the research, Ravi, first if you actually have equal equity splits, it means you're actually very averse to having a conversation about contribution and who is going to do more. You're engaging in avoidance behavior. And what the data show is, the more, when you have equal equity splits, you actually have lower pre-money valuations. I should point out the venture capitalists with whom I teach the course they disagree vehemently with me. They say, what's all this bullshit? When people actually agree to equal equity splits, they're a good team and I said like, but that's a superstition you have. You call that 20 years of experience. I call that superstition. That's it. Go for it. So, so the one of the, we've been talking about bad friction, but I want to talk about good friction. And the comparison I'm loving to make these days is of course we all know to drop out Elizabeth Holmes who was briefly on campus here. And you also probably all know that she tried to push through that machine, that blood testing machine which didn't work, things called Edison. It did not get FDA approval and there was sort of a, if you read the bad blood, John Cario's book about it, there's sort of a moment where she tried to get it on US Army helicopters to blood tests and she had a mad dog, Madison, four star general pushing on her behalf and some sort of lowly bureaucrat pushed back against her. And one of the reasons was she didn't have FDA approval. And I like comparing Elizabeth Holmes to two more recent graduates, Greta Meyer and Amanda Telebrees of a pronounciation name, right? They started a company called SQL. They went through by the way just about every entrepreneurship class that we have at Stanford. SQL is reinventing the modern tampon, both of them graduated. They got $5 million with the venture capital and just got FDA approval in August. So to me, there's bad friction and there's good friction. I don't use a tampon, you probably guessed that. But if I was sticking one of those things in my body, I would want FDA approval. So that's a case where I think that friction was a good thing. And I think it's also cool they both graduated, by the way. I have a follow up question that doesn't have anything to do with tampons, but going back to mad dog, Madison. I have met mad dog, Madison. And I'm actually curious for the individual that you wrote about, actually, no spoilers, go read the book, who did push back successfully. How does one have the backbone to do that? What kind of encouragement do you have for an investment? So this guy was sort of a lowly defense department, he's like a lieutenant colonel. And when he retired, they gave him all sorts of awards for fighting back to mad dog, Madison. And if we want to talk about fighting back, this is the problem of psychological safety. So either you need to be in a place that's safe, you need to have an exit option. Now, I say this to my students, I've got an asshole boss, I want to quit immediately. And I say, how big is your mortgage? Who do you have to support? And so forth. So a lot of it depends on the option. And then there's some people who are simply so brave that they're kind of suicidal and bless you. But I don't want to be the child who depends on your rent, for example. Hang on, one thing that you started with, that's quite interesting is incentives, right? So the fact that this person when he retired was awarded all these things. Why is co-op by his colleagues? Why is co-op okay by his colleagues? But then incentives have to be right for this kind of friction fix. Well, to Madison's credit, Madison sort of made the guy fly down to him and talk with them and Madison argued with him for an hour and raised his hands and said, you're right. So Madison just pulled those, this guy had the backbone to argue with Madison. And then Madison said, you're right. So in that case, everybody kind of did the right thing. I want to double click on some of the things you're bringing up are going against side of the superstitions or the religious foundations of Silicon Valley. So I want to ask this one more to fall up and then I'll turn over to Emily on further questions too. On this idea, generally, the feeling is that growth and speed are unlimited goods. And venture capitals and others, the whole notion, the definition of a startup versus a small company is speed. It's growing at a certain exponential curve. So what I want to understand is what are the research takeaways on speed versus long-term success? Because it sounds like you don't want to go so fast to become a therapist where you're breaking things. But you also don't want to go so slow that you don't take off. Is there an optimal growth? So the analogy we use in it, six o'clock this afternoon tonight, we have a Wall Street Journal article coming out about when to go slow literally six o'clock it's dropping. So the analogy we use there and we like to use is the people who win formula wonder NASCAR races do not keep pedal to the metal the entire time, otherwise they would crash die and run out of fuel. All that sort of stuff, they break, they do pit stops. And sometimes they get in crashes and have to stop. So I think it's sort of the same with a startup and there are times and just to be a little bit academic, huggies more of an academic than I am now. The research Danny Coniman won the Nobel Prize in Economics. When you're in a cognitive mind field and things are all screwed up and you don't know what's going on, the best thing to do is to stop and figure out what's going on. In the example that we use and he was a guest in your class, you should talk about it was no, Barton, it weighs when he got $30 million in venture capital and people download ways and nobody would keep it. What he did was he did a six week moratorium on product development and a much longer moratorium on hiring on theory that he needed to fix things. So Huggy maybe want to add a little bit to that. Yeah, and that's actually a great example. So no, you know, ways got acquired as many of you recall by Google. What was interesting was at that time, no and his other co-founders, when they got $30 million, they were under immense pressure from the founders to hire more people. Perfect. Best of capital, says. Yeah, they were pushing, you know, you got all this money, you got to hire, you got to get to the market. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And interestingly what no did was, no and his co-founders had a meeting and then they called all their engineers in Israel and they announced a moratorium on hiring. And some of the engineers said, you got all this money, why aren't you hiring people? And I'm said, look, when we hire people, we like to hire smart people. Smart people usually overflow with ideas and when they join ways, we're in this like very narrow space where we're trying to get a product to work right. All these new talented people are going to come and give lots of ideas. If I hire 400 people, I've got to say no 400 times. And I really don't think we need to do that. The other interesting thing that he said was, we're hiring smart people, smart people also in norms reasoning tend to be overconfident. They think they can do the job like on day one, but we know it takes two weeks for them to even get up to speed. And so he asked all of his employees, if it takes two weeks or three weeks and that's actually a median estimate if you will, for them to get ready, he looked at me and he said, who am I going to spend most of my time on? All the non-performing new people or the high performers who currently exist. He said, I don't want to allocate my time dealing with a bunch of non-performers for like two, three weeks, let's actually stagger the hiring and not get people in big chunks. So I want to bring this into the current AI since we know that the money is just dumping. It's just amazing. So I have a friend, I want to name her. She has been a CHR of so many Silicon Valley companies, it's crazy and she actually is taking a break from her last one because her CEO of course wanted her to hire and hire and hire and hire at this start and end of the pandemic, which she did, which is a lot of work. And then they decided a few months ago they had 30% to many employees, profitable companies, so she had to lay them all off, the 30%. And so now she's on the bench, what she's interviewing for AI jobs. She said they've got all this money and they want me to hire and hire and hire and hire and hire, even though they don't even need the people and they don't even know what to do with them. So I think that's an argument against just... Unfettered, yes. Hiring people as a substitute for thinking I would call that. I understand that. You know, just to extend one remark very quickly on speed, what our research shows is speed is one side of the coin, Ravi. The other side of the coin is time poverty. So yeah, because when you have time poverty, the moment you perceive time is limited, it's really interesting the kinds of outcomes that ensue. We asked one of the graduate students, PhD students at GSB, hey, take a look at all the various startups, scrape all their public filings, mission statement visions, anything they've communicated to the public, use a large language model and actually calculate the linguistic emphasis on speed. So she came up with a number. She said, okay, what do I do with this? I said, now you got this number, estimated regression equation where your left hand side dependent variable is, what's your time to become a unicorn, receive a $1 billion valuation? So she does the analysis rigorously and says, well, the more you emphasize speed, the quicker you become a unicorn. She says, speed works. I said, wait a minute. I said, why don't you actually do another analysis? And she said, what is that? I said, show me the relationship between the time taken to receive a unicorn valuation and the probability of lawsuits two years down the line. What do you think happened? The faster you become a unicorn, the more likely you are to run into legal trouble because people green light back behavior. I got to do this quick. I got to get it done tomorrow and you cut corners. And in an experiment where you give a $10 payment for them to participate in an experiment, it's amazing to the group where you give them time pressure. It's incredible how much they lie about themselves. So speed actually triggers self-emhancement effects. You want to look good to the rest of the work and that's why you do bad shit. And was there an optimal category of people that had true long-term success? So is there in terms of the sentiment around speed? So it's going to be mathematically? Yeah, mathematically we could tell you what the thing is. The problem is it's not how much the time is but what it feels like that people within the company. That's the problem. OK, that's the keeping. Emily, do you have a couple minutes before I turn over to the students for questions? I know you're looking at things from the lens of very big companies. Very big companies now. Very big company. Maybe I'll ask one very slightly, well, spicy question, which is actually very common to Silicon Valley. Many of these companies, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Netflix started with, what is it? Break all the rules. Right. And move quickly. And now they've become these giant companies, public companies with lots of different pieces. And they're trying to go through this cultural shift because they have this DNA of move fast and break things. So for the two of you, have you seen companies that have successfully transitioned and modified their DNA to succeed? Well, first of all, there are large complex organizations that are less bad. They all have their problems. Amazon, Walmart, Boy, Sotty, is done a great job at Microsoft. And I don't know what the magic cures are but there's two things when we think about it. Some of it is to have just the discipline of subtraction of making as simple as possible. The Amazon and Walmart culture, they're all over the place about simplicity and it's in their founding DNA. So that's part of it. But there's another thing that happens in large complex organizations is people break into little silos and little pieces. They tend to view one another as enemies and they tend to be bad at handoffs. So what good leaders do of large complex organizations is that they figure out ways to make the handoffs work and to make people feel less of enemies. And there are many design solutions here if I compare Apple to Microsoft. They do encourage all sorts of collaborations and handoffs and getting a lot of people involved in the decision. That's part of Sotty's motto. But the idea is play nice now that when you're collaborative and share information, you're good. At Apple at secrecy, apples like the most secretive place just about on earth, it's much more leak proof than the CIA, just as an example, there's no comparison. And in a great comparison about the difference in collaboration, I'll talk about our colleague, Kim Scott, who worked at Google, and then she went to Apple and she said it was amazing when I was at Google where she said, nobody ever sent you a Google, stay in your lane. You can run away into anything. She said I was getting hundreds and hundreds of emails a day and said, I got to Apple, I was getting four or five because I got only talked to people in my group. And so people say that secrecy is really bad and everybody should collaborate and share information. And there is an argument that secrecy is maybe one of the key things that Google doesn't enable's focus. I mean, at Apple because it enables focus. But the key thing with both, if we do Microsoft and we do Apple, is there systems where there's logically consistent in everybody understands the rules. They know what game they're playing. They're different games. Right. You know, quickly in response to your question, and this is something all of you as potential founders need to be aware of, the large companies that Emily alluded to, the large companies and we were just talking moments ago, at least to me, to me, they remind me of the Ottoman Empire. You're not really an employee, you're a court here in the Ottoman Empire, and you've got to find out who the Sultan is and you've got to kiss the... You've got to kiss the Sultan's ass and... The pretend you get the idea. And you know, but the big problem even for startups as well as large companies is because Bob and I talk in this Wall Street Journal article talks about it because we have an addition bias as human beings. We like to add stuff. And the big problem with large companies is they don't mold the lawn. They think subtraction is something you do once. We got rid of a bunch of things and we're done. Subtraction is like mowing the lawn. How often do we mow the lawn? I just zoom pretty regularly. How can you create an organization if nobody mows the lawn and everybody wants to plant new saplings? Right, right. I mean, the weeds are going to kill them. So you really need to mow the lawn. Unfortunately mowing the lawn is an orphan problem. Like maintenance. And maintenance, yes. So let me ask one more question that we're going to open it up to the students, which is just dovetailing that for the students that don't start companies but want to go work for an organization. What takeaways and career advice do you have in terms of what does the research show from a friction perspective on how to choose organizations to work for which will set you up for the best success? Yeah, that's a great question. So one of the things, you know, maybe you guys should really think about this as, for us, if you want to really be an effective leader, Bob and I argue that the effective leaders are those who see themselves as trustees of other people's time. And the moment you think of other people's time as a valuable precious resource, you're not going to piss it away. So one of the things I'd recommend you do, and Bob and I have talked about it is, if you're going to work in a company, suss out your boss, is this person a time-waster who is going to make you spin your wheels? Or is this person somebody who respects your time and makes sure you're not doing doovers constantly? Because it's the doover that kind of frustrates you. And we never think of that as a diagnostic test. So I had just thought of this, but another diagnostic test is whether or not your employer treats customers, and whether they actually are trustees of customers' time. In a good example, since Netflix has bounced back yet again, and this is in the book, one of my advisees, actually, the only advisee I've ever had who probably had 150 subordinates, this guy named Eric Colson, who was, he was at Netflix doing algorithms and stuff, and he described how back 2012ish or so that he and other people, including Patty McCord, who was then basically head of HR, they were embarrassed because it was so difficult to end a Netflix subscription. It was early in that, it was 2009 or 2010. So they were embarrassed, and then they started complaining to read hastings about this, and we'd said, so let's just make it so it's one button. I was describing this earlier today in the course of writing the book a couple of times, I tried to see how easy it was to cancel my Netflix subscription. I almost did it accidentally. It's just one button, it's really easy. And Eric said, so we did it initially because we didn't want to be embarrassed, but you know, like my mom wants to enter in that Netflix subscription, it's impossible. But he said what they figured out was they got much better data from people, because when they quit, that was a sign that it was easy, so they knew that things had to change. And also people knew after they quit, it was easier to restart their subscription and then jump off again as opposed to my financial time subscription. When I like that financial time, so we have like friends, they're doing articles about us. I think that I spent an hour and a half trying to end my financial time subscription at one point. It was just absolutely crazy, so I'm afraid to re-subscribe because I don't think I can end it. But the reason that I like that, Eric Colson and Patten McCord was head of HR's point in the book is they both made them more proud. And it gave them better data, better user feedback data too. Yeah, jet skiing quickly behind what Bob said. Another test you should use when you're looking at jobs and careers is ask yourself, is my future boss a hippopotamus? Who opens his or her mouth and constantly talks all the time and makes more statements than asks questions. If your boss is a hippo, I would not recommend you work for a hippopotamus. Instead you should actually work for bosses or elephants. When you think of an elephant, what do you think of? Big ears, big trunk, the great listeners and they ask helpful questions that turn on the lights in a house. Bigopotamus's want to be light houses. You don't need to work for a hippo. Think of working for an elephant. That's a great metaphor. With that, we're going to open it up for students. Any questions are welcome and invited. We've got a couple minutes and the CAs will go around with mics. The famous CAs with the mics. Yep, we can hear you go for it. Yeah, thank you for the talk. I thought it was interesting when you compare the cultures that Google and Apple and Mindsick is the collaboration and the more you learn the better. What do you think is the reason as to why having a smaller team makes people more efficient? Well, so there's this thing called, at least at Google, I mean at Apple, there's this thing that's called collaboration overload. There's got to be a broad processor, a whole book on it. There's all this evidence that one of the things that just drags us all down is when we spend all this time in meetings, answering emails, Slack messages, Zoom meetings and so forth. If you're just focusing on the little part or a little thing that your team is doing, it's more efficient and less in eruption. The challenge at Apple is how you glue it together and the way that Apple does it, and this is another thing that is not popular, it's like, oh, decentralization. Apple does it with centralization. In fact, there's somebody we won't name, but I remember it was about 10 years ago, there's a guy, well, I better not say he was, but he was in the top eight at Apple. He said, so the next iPhone, he said, I think the only person, he said, only two people know all the parts of it. Johnny Ive and Tim Cook. He said, I don't think anybody else knows all the parts. I don't know if that's good, but working so far. Next question. If you guys have a question, raise your hands and even while the question is being asked, then we can put you on decks. I love the back of the front. Okay. Yes, I know. You asked him a question. I'm like, you passed and break things. I don't know what you said. Early stages, like, one of the main advantages I know as a startup, it's you're more nimble than, let's say, like a bigger corporation. But at the same time, you most early stage startups kind of need funding. And I've heard from a lot of sources that, and I've also heard from like a lot of sources that, you know, this happens more with angels than BCs, but when you take on funding early on, a lot of, you're kind of beholden to certain expectations. And then you lose some of that nimbleness. You have to answer to investors. They have certain expectations, milestones. They want you to hit things like that. So like, sort of what's your opinion on that? Like, be nimble for as long as you can be and don't take that investment or just take the investment earlier on. So that's a good question. My quick response would be just, you know, I assume you're talking about the angel stage. I wouldn't take anybody, any money from anybody who just offers it just like that. You really want to recruit an angel and you want to think carefully about what kinds of angels you don't want money from and what kind of angels you want money from. So I would not like to take money from a first-time angel. They're going to micromanage you and put all of this pressure that you just sort of alluded to, or for that matter, a first-time VC, they'd be all over you in no time. So that's one. The second thing is, there is evidence that if you're a startup and if you have a lot of money, you actually tend to make a lot of mistakes. You hire too many senior people, you give away equity easily. And it actually meshes well with the research and creativity. You know, you guys should actually look at some of this research. It's very amusing. In one experiment, they found that if you put people in a dark room, as opposed to a bright room, people in the dark room actually came up with more creative ideas, as opposed to a brightly lit room, just to give you an example. So you just kind of want to make sure, you know, putting and creating constraints and obstacles is the key to leadership. And you want to think about, what obstacles do I need to get rid of so we can do things quickly? What obstacles do I need to sort of put in? And so you want to be very mindful about recruiting angels, VCs and like. I don't know. You guys do this. Well, so my reaction was the advice you gave on choosing a boss, applies to a VC who's going to be on your board. You know, you want elephants not to have apodimuses. And so I don't think it's a binary decision. I think it's a, I think if you actually get a good elephant, they're hugely valuable, even though for key strategic things to actually facilitate your next round and acquisition, things like that, but you don't want to hit. Well, just, people will, oh, sorry. Just real quickly, where most of this information comes from is something that's supposed to be a bad word, but is gossip. I think gossip can be very useful. So use your gossip networks. I was going to say, no, and I agree. So the other thing I was going to say was, and the way that I did to determine if it's a hippo or an elephant is not to ask the, well, you can, you can make a diagnostic decision with the VC, but talk to other founders. So the key thing is to talk to other founders that that investor has worked with. They will tell you the truth. It doesn't matter what the VC or whoever set whatever they say about themselves. Thank you. Okay. We have, we, we have a question down here, unless the CAs have another, and gang, just raise your hand if you have a question and we'll put you on deck. So you'll get in. You remember your questions that gifts to us? They're not interruptions. Hello. In software engineering, frictions is called bloated software. So as the software evolves, it becomes bloated and that's friction. And it's called technical depth. Right, right. And as you said, the organization get complicated. We hire more admin people. We blow the organization and we have an organizational depth, maybe. And in software engineering, we spend a lot of time taking care of the software to avoid technical depth to refactoring. So we have software refactoring. We do that all the time, right. So do we do that in organization? I don't think so, but. Well, we have one minute. So, so, so, so, so I would just use one word, which is Uber. So we did a case study on Uber with TwanFam, the CTO, where the organizational debt in the in the technical debt were mutually reinforcing because everybody could do whatever they wanted. See, described it was 400 speedboats going in 400 different directions. So as a result, since that was decentralization was allowed, as a result of that organizational debt, the technical debt built up and then had to be reduced. So, so they are intertwined and sometimes mutually reinforcing. Great question. The problem with organization that is it's invisible. It only shows up when you're late for customers, your product gets delayed, a whole bunch of consequences happen. That's when you need to get rid of organization. So, so Twan said he thought the best indicator of technical debt, an organizational debt was sleep debt provision. So except when you're having to stay all night to keep the site up, you know you've got technical organizational debt. That was his assessment. What a great line.
