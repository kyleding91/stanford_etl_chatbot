 Who you are defines how you build. This is the OddProner of Thought Leader Series. Brought to you by Stanford E Corner. Hello everyone, my name is Emily Ma and I'd like to welcome you to the OddProner of Thought Leader Series. Presented by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, the Entrepreneurship Center in the School of Engineering. And, basis, the Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurs students. I'm super excited to introduce you to Andy Carster today. Andy is a senior scout at Justin Space Cowboy at X, the Moon Shut Factory at Alphabet. Andy has spent the last two decades driving renewable energy innovation and other climate solutions. In addition to his role at X, Carster is the founder and a seconder chairman of Elemental Labs, an organization that pursues systems-based solutions to promote a sustainable future and equitably empower communities. Also, from 2005 to 2008, Andy served as the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, managing a $2 billion annual federal portfolio devoted to applied science, research, and development. In this role, he helped to assemble significant bipartisan coalitions to implement and enact the Energy Policy Act, the Energy Independence and Security Act, and the American Convites Act, all of which continues to remain foundational to US Energy Policy. So, I'm very excited because Andy is my colleague and I get to work with him and today I get to ask him all sorts of questions that we don't normally talk about at work. So, I'm going to start with the first one, Andy. I know you journeyed through the world and you've collected exceptionally rich set of experiences from Houston to Hong Kong. What were you like as a 20-year-old? Most of the folks in this class are in their 20s and curious how you were motivated much more during that time. Oh, boy. Yeah, that's a good question. First of all, I have such respect in a steam for you, my colleague. I should be interviewing you, but I'm honored to have the tables turned. At 20 years old, I was as had as much nervous energy and drive as I do today, I would say. I was really deeply moved by what was the existential challenge of the day, which was living under the threat of nuclear annihilation. That was top of mind to me. It was something that I'd grown up with as a military kid on bases. So much of my experience as a young person was the Vietnam War, and I was young. I didn't participate in Vietnam War, but my father was deployed abroad and other school children's fathers. That constant overhang of a fairly militarized society deeply engaged in foreign places, and with the cloud of Cold War and arms race, really consumed much of my mission. It drove me to really want to eliminate nuclear weapons. So at 20, that's what I was engaged in. I mean, the other fun things too, go to the pub and have a good time and all the other crazy things. That was an overriding political and social sentiment of the day. That new nuclear weapons you went into energy and then nature. I want to talk about experience I had with you about two years ago now. Part of the ending carstener fan club, we get to do some really fun things. Go and walk through your woods and sit under the redwoods, where the UN came together and sat in 1945 in honor of the FDR. It was a totally visceral experience for me because these trees have been around for hundreds of years, and I recognize that that point, and many times when we go on walks these days, that it's not humans and nature like separate. Humans are part of nature, and you have over time, from nuclear proliferation to nature, you've developed a really deep connection with nature and a deeper perspective commitment for it. Tell us more about that. Well, that's a fun one to play with. I guess I should, I felt like I left myself hanging there with sort of a dark cloud with that last answer. You know, I should give you the other half of the answer. I mean, you very specifically asked about when I was 20. But when I was 22, you and I had had the conversation before that, you know, it was 24 months later, and I couldn't have predicted it. I was at the Berlin Wall chipping it away at the dawn of a brand new era. You know, Gorbachev, take this wall down, the strategic arms reduction talks, the end of the cold war, things that people didn't see coming 90 and 120 days out. So it wasn't that that darkness and that overhang and that anxiety and hiding under the desk and Dan, rather reporting from Saigon and all that stuff influenced the rest of my life. It was deeply eclipsed by the spirit of hope and optimism that I experienced as a graduating senior when I was 22, which is very different than when I was 20 and taking courses in East German economics and comparative communist systems that have served me nothing in my whole life. So then you'd say, well, what do you do when you're 22 and the world has changed different from the courses you were taking, you're senior fall semester. And now the entire, there's been such an inflection, such a vertical shock to the world order. Well, I was challenged by this, oh, what do they used to say? Let's make a new world order and it wasn't make the world safe for democracy. It's making a new world order. And so I sort of strapped on a backpack and wanted to go see the earth a little bit and understand about it. And I found much like when I was a child acting as the navigator on the cross country trips, my family would take from the open, fairly deserted, hot plains of Texas up through the arbuckle mountains and the fault lines and the seismology of Oklahoma and into the the weak fields of tanzes and across the Ozarks and up through the corn fields. And finally, ending up in the land of 10,000 lakes in Minnesota with furs and pine trees and all kinds of natural wonder. I found myself much more enamored with nature than with man built things on the journey like that. And I found the same experience while a lot of my class peers were going from your rail train station to train station and logging all the wonderful things that our culture western civilization produces in Paris and the Prado and Madrid and so forth. You know, I found myself camping in farmer fields and and just more enamored with the natural open spaces and what I could learn about them. I don't think that I developed it particularly stronger than anybody else. It's hard to walk anybody else's shoes. I like to think that we all have a sensibility and a relationship with nature. And it's really a question of whether we remove the insulation that we built for ourselves and allow ourselves to encounter it. Because basically, whether I'm a small boy traveling navigating in a car, whether I'm a young backpacker or whether it's today, you know, going to a major conservation area. In all cases, it's just connecting with my own innate sense of wonder and discovery and then letting that sort of fire my, you know, serotonin and synaptic impulses. Well, you know what? This is the time before spading. I realize how much and how important it is for us to just be outdoors once a day as we're sitting together here on a screen. I'm glad I still get to connect with you. But now I go on daily walks, right? And it's just our mind. We operate in different frequency, then, you know, the digital world. But with that, you know, it's interesting for me because I think you've talked a lot about, you know, you've had nature as a passion. You've been committed to it. And you spent a lot of time thinking about how we might value nature differently. Like I value nature, but I don't, I can't put a price cap to that tree outside, right? How do you think about that now? And why should we value nature? Like what difference would that make if you could measure the treasure as you speak? Yeah. You know, even when I can't do the daily walk, I got to say that every morning when I go into my backyard and look at the red woods, you know, with the morning light, I think of it as a miracle. You know, and Einstein used to say, there's only two kinds of people in the world. Those that think that nothing is a miracle and those who think that everything is a miracle. You know, and I'm deeply in sort of that ladder camp. And, you know, I always kind of think that actually everybody is, they just have to allow themselves to not to not lose their end year old spirit. But, but the, you know, I don't think it's a choice of whether we're going to ultimately value nature. I think it is an inevitable, inexorable necessity. And, as if we fail to do it, we will be the first species to have designed our own demise. Okay. That's an incredible thing. We don't have a big claws and camouflage and, and Harry Peltz and the things that nature provides to so many other species. We have our brains. That's all we have. That is the only evolved piece of our entire beam that is of any use in ensuring our longevity and the survival of our species. And, if we neglect to use it to manage in a sustainable way, those things that give us security to eat and drink and breathe and thrive, then we of our own will will be the only species known to have designed our own demise. And so, since we have designed systems, which do put a value on nature, it puts a value on exploiting nature, on extracting nature, on destroying nature, we can also design to conserve nature to use nature as an ally and enhancing our quality of living to use nature as an ally in mitigating the problems that we, that have been self imposed. And, and, and so it's not like some people look at and go, well, what a radical theory to create valuation and market pricing for natural capital. And I would say haven't grown up in Texas and then part of the energy industry might go, oh, life, we actually do this all the time. We value a tree, we value it as lumber. And if we not value it as lumber, we value it as worthless or potential lumber. The only question is whether we're actually going to value it for what we scientifically know it can provide to us a source of respiration and transpiration, a source of oxygen production, unlike in machinery, we could possibly devise a source of sequestration, unlike anything we have yet to biomanic. And, and so it's sort of a full hearty mission to say, let's take away those miraculous beings that coexist with us in symbiosis, let's remove symbiosis to make it harder for us species to thrive. So, since we've imposed this design and design the market system, a design attraction to the comments, of course we can design a limby of the comments. But, you know, that's why I go back to this Berlin wall thing. I'm all the belief that we can, we can solve big intractable problems. We can preempt our own worst tendencies to destroy ourselves or a road or capacity or live with hostility. And in this case, we actually don't have a choice. We just have to execute and fast. So, why is it that we haven't accelerated towards this? Like, what is holding us back? Like, what are the, are we the frog in the boiling water? Like, I think most of us really do appreciate nature. But, you know, what are the obstacles in the way for, for you seeing our ability to remedy the comments? And what are the obstacles that prevent corporations and nonprofits and governments from, from, from, to treasury? So, the wonders. You know, it's a great question. And it's a question bigger than me in the sense that, you know, all I can do is speculate on it. I feel like there's a sociological underpinning to it, to, in, in truth. You know, I felt so gratified to grow up in a country where you were empowered to do anything. You weren't hard enough in trying to pursue it. And you had a good idea this time is coming. That's really, you know, the student constituency we're talking to, they're entrepreneurs, they're innovators, they're catalyst. And, and, and, and I think that, that used to come with a sense of boundless optimism. And my sense is that that optimism has eroded. It's, it's either become somewhat complacent or it's become self-doubt. And there's, in, insufficient, there's not a similar of gravity or, or leadership, even from our, from our highest offices, that would inspire a sensibility that we should be confident that we can devise solutions, particularly for those problems that we have self imposed. And so first, the first thing is, you know, I, with the motto I've always lived by is, you know, if you can see it, and you believe it, you're going to keep it. And, and, and so, so the first thing is for, there's no lack of concept. I think there's a lack of belief. And, and, but I, I don't, I'm not even remotely deterred. And you know this from where we work, that, that we have the technological means and the capacity to innovate solutions at scale and speed commensurate with the problems we face. The question is, us as a bottleneck in our optimism, our decision making, our collaboration, and our execution. Huh, that's great. I agree with you wholeheartedly. It's an interesting time. You mentioned earlier, you know, the world changed for you when you were 22, or within 9,220 days, right? So we're kind of in a state, right? You know, I've, they're senior sitting in the audience right now, who just saw their entire world change. I mean, all the students always need it. You know, you're probably seeing some interesting parallels and yet, you know, as you choose to believe decades ago, rather than it being a dark time, you choose to see the hope in that situation. Why would you say to the seniors today who are graduating into this extraordinary time? It's hard, you know, my daughter is graduating from high school and this virtual thing. And you know, we should be hugging each other and holding each other and, I'm fighting each other. And everybody works so hard. And my heart hurts for this idea that the very thing we need most is something that could harm us and that we, it is a perverse irony. You know, and you know, you can say all the hominemes you want about, you know, adversity, breed strength and so forth, we're certainly testing that. But, you know, what I, you're right in the analogy. I feel very strongly about that. And, you know, the last time I felt this way, of course, was 9-11. And, you know, by the time the great recession came about, people were, you know, my God, the great recession. But if you'd gone through sort of 9-11, more than 1987, pull back, the great recession felt like an economic adjustment. You know, it's the same here a little bit. We've got a corollary that is an extraordinary economic adjustment. It's a jolt, it's a, it's, it speeds the great recession. And yet it is bifurcated, unusually, unlike anything we have ever seen in the history of mankind that we have accelerating market performance with record unemployment. Okay, we have a complete cognitive dissonance of separation because all the policy was directed towards mitigating a financial crisis. In fact, it was the only learning curve or tools the federal government had. So basically, and the entire existence of the Republic, we've, we've accumulated a trillion dollars of debt until this stimulus in which we've now gone to about 3.5 trillion in a matter of weeks. So at 3.5 trillion and where does that liquidity go at a time it were completely close. Well, it all goes to Wall Street. And so everybody's recovering everything on their equities and they're racing to see where the top is and it's completely irrationally bifurcated financial crisis from economic crisis. And of course, all these graduating seniors are moving into economic crisis world. Okay, not financial crisis that didn't happen. Okay. Okay, everything's going to get their property and figure out what happens with that. And in this summer's going to be tough. But the, but the, when they go out in this economic recession world, the first thought is, oh my god, where did all the jobs go and what am I going to do and so forth. The next thought ought to be, you know, I'm a Stanford student. I'm an empowered, educated, valuable, individual. I'm an entrepreneur. I'm an innovator. The world needs my wits, my guts, my capacity to sleep on a couch, my capacity to use a phone and call my network, my capacity to come up with a better idea. Because as hard as these times are, the greatest opportunities, the greatest opportunities for inflection are available in misfortune. And we have never seen this level of misfortune. And so, you know, most of these students won't have kids yet. They don't have family obligations. They got dead, you know, probably going into it. But, but, but when they get out there, full of ideas and energy and action, you know, and Stanford right here at the epicenter of global innovation, a true sort of Florence kind of place. You know, the opportunities are going to be immense, but they're going to be self made. This is not through the career placement office. This is not somebody's going to train me and apprentice me. This is going to be I'm applying my energy, my ideas and my sense of mission. And then I will follow the stream to the river and end up, you know, with a torrent and and and I guarantee the people who are in this podcast are all going to be fine. And so the first thing they've got to say to this self is, I'm fine. And I'm in America and I'm safe and I have a Stanford degree and I'm an entrepreneur and I'm here in Silicon Valley and thank God because I've got it as good as anybody possibly could right now. For sure, for sure, you know what, we are safe. We have food to eat the most part right might be limited in choices. Our environment is actually quickly human right now with fewer cars in the road and we're seeing some patterns. This is the great experiment right now with shelter at home in in San Clara County in the area. There's lots of great things to look forward to and I got sorry, I didn't mean to catch up, but I've got a good entrepreneur. My portfolio, one of the greats. I mean, I think he was EY's on for the year last year, Joe to Simone from carbon 3D, who you might remember, you know, it's a doer and you know carbon 3D had a big $800 million contract with the D.D.S. and they've got yelling Coleman from Dow is the CEO Joe is very self-actualized putter in place and Malay on the board. They were right on their way to unicorn status. And the minute this hit instead of saying, oh my God, people aren't going to buy tennis shoes. Joe said, oh my God, I can produce more swabs than any swab factory in ways nobody remotely anticipated. So I'm going to go to Stanford Hospital. I'm going to get the spec. I'm going to understand it to a tee. You know, called me hooked up with the governor's task force. And now that entire company is sort of a leader in the swaps. Now that's a high margin high frame business. But nobody will ever forget the decisive leadership action risk taking intelligent finding the stream to the river, you know, that Joe has done here. And I guarantee that when he goes out for his next round, people are going to go, that company can do anything. So I mean, so I just bring that up because there's a, I'm not just buying the sky. There are manifestations of this entrepreneurship. And that's why California and my people just not getting in as hard as what is happening on these coasts. I really appreciate that example because I've been noticing with my own team with our partners on the ground that people have been willing to step outside of their normal day to day in ways that I've never seen before. So a good example of this is in healthcare, you would have never imagined even six months ago that one could get reimbursed for a video call. And yet this is the normal, right? This is new moral. We have to do it. Because you can't go to a hospital for, you know, just to check in with your doctor anymore. What other, what other things I've seen. I feel like this is a great time of unlocking where people are no longer holding themselves to timeline that they thought that they needed to be before them to or particular domains of expertise. People are just going and solving. What else have you done? I'm very, I mean, you're one of these great leaders. You know, you've pivoted from distribution from, you know, how do we optimize tracing and distribution with precision so that we can understand with great efficiency and not let a single mango, you know, go to waste anywhere. And the supply chain and we can track the fish and make an intelligent helps be season. You had a whole scheme. You know, you've been developing the technology and the world class team. And then you pivoted, if you will, to redistribution. You know, how or maybe it's the other way around for redistribution or distribution elimination of waste and a supply chain. And now, how can you help the most people in the most intelligent way with the greatest good. Right. So, so I, you know, what I don't really what that points to is the highest value society will award is to problem solvers. It's not just to the product of their labor or a service you put out product and service is just a medium of exchange. It is the, it is the idea of a solution, the efficacy and the relentless, you know, the relentless passionate pursuit of the outcome. So you're that, you know, I call those people doers, right. And, you know, Joe's a doer, you're a doer. You know, and probably most of the people on this call are doers. But, but that's what we've got to do is we've got to go out there and do. I think the examples are countless, you know, Bob Coker, who's who's leaving the government's government task force on testing. He's a partner. Been rocked. That's on his day job. He's managing a portfolio of great biomedical companies. But, but he's, you know, is spending five days a week in sacrameno and trying to ramp certain metrics and everything you're testing because they can't. There's no calvery coming from the federal government. This is kind of each state for themselves, each community themselves. I wish it wasn't so. It is. But it's good to see that we're in the community in a state where everybody acts with men, men like precision and, and, and goes to the front and says, how can I be helpful. Well, since he turned the tables on me for a second, let's talk about natural security and food security. So everything we're doing right now at X and food has been about not just food security as a reaction and part of the recovery. The home is that we will have food security in the long term during the period of reform. You and I chatted about that. What does this mean for natural security? We talked about this. You did your testimony to Congress some time ago. You've been encouraging people to think about natural security being as important, if not more important than natural security alongside it. What do you think? What do you think the future looks like now with natural security? Yeah, well, you can have natural security without national security, but you can't have national security without natural security. And we're just trying to help people think through things and, you know, I'm an old cold warrior. Like I said, I got to take down the Berlin Wall. The truth is most of the foreign policy complex never took off their cold warrior jackets. Right? The world changed then. We became a globalized planet. Right? We, you know, truthfully the world changed, you know, 50 years ago when for the first time in my lifetime, we saw images of a blue marble from another celestial body. For the first time ever, we understood we were interconnected. That was the aha moment. Right? But we were still in Cold War. We were still very factionalized. We had the UN aspiration and all the beauty that was launched there and we're woods. But, you know, the truth is we weren't living up to it to a degree. The end of the Cold War meant a recognition of interdependence on an unprecedented level. And if you're a a a a trader or a developer or an investor or a financier, you just called it globalization or Tom would call it the world is flat. Okay? And I'm part of all these organizations, trilateral commission, council, foreign relations, etc. And everybody still has a bit of that Cold War patina. They're still wearing the jacket. They haven't really left the letterman's jacket behind and said, what is the new thing? Right? And it's sort of the same right now with globalization. That interdependence was far more than free trade flows and and and and 20 foot containers from China and how many toys could we get? How cheap at Walmart that globalization was how do we treat the global comments that are unaccounted for but that that ultimately are the safety and the security and the quality of our species existence. Things that we have taken for granted because we thought they were inexhaustible or without impact. We now know when we you know that is beyond a shadow of a doubt that when you can hit 70 degrees in the Antarctic peninsula, you know, that was once completely frozen and lose the last and ice shelf when you are losing permanently the ice cap in the North and all the reflectivity that goes with it. And because we can't really re freeze Greenland, we know we have permanently nest with things. Okay, so we can't necessarily undo the damage, but we can adapt and protect ourselves intelligently by designing systems at a commensurate global scale of interdependence. So when we talk about natural security, we're basically saying, look, I'm not worried anymore about those big goose stepping Chinese and Russian parades of the communist past the viewing stand and the missiles they're going to launch in Kim Jong-il and that whole drama. You know, it's a pain, you got to manage it. You know, there's a human diplomatic area, but it's not nearly as consequential as the frequency and severity of natural changes that are occurring that are going to affect our food supply, our water supply, our capacity to ensure ourselves from damages and flooding in the streets and in Miami and elsewhere. So, I have another final question for you before we open it up to the students and everything they want to co-teal rain about. So, these students who come together today are here because they're interested in being an entrepreneur. How do you define entrepreneurship for yourself and how are you an entrepreneur? What a great question. Well, I think of it as a privilege. I wouldn't have described myself as an entrepreneur until somebody else did years later. Actually, I don't think anybody's describing as an entrepreneur until I sold my first company. But before that, they just said, yeah, there's that kid with the shoe box again, that kind of thing. But the idea, of course, was removed from the entrepreneurial ecosystem that exists out here and so extraordinary. You know, I mean, if it were in the rest of the nation, anything like it, you know, our productivity would be just multiplicative. But I think anybody, you know, this is, this is the argument of nature versus nurture, born an entrepreneur, can you learn entrepreneurship? I'm not sure it's like so many other things, art, journalism, public speaking, you know, etc. What do you have a previous position to? But I do believe that the common denominator, no matter how well you do, and that's whether you're running a local floral office that supports the baseball team or whether you've got some sort of limited partnership for a wind project or whether you're Elon Musk or Joe to some moment. You know, in all those cases, the person has got to be driven by what we used to call fire in the belly in Texas, anything you call it, inner fire here. And, and, but you've got to have something burning inside you that creates a relentless passion for risk taking and achievement beyond your available resource with the idea that you are going to create an ad value. And usually that latter thing creating an ad value is linked to the fire, because if it's not, I never have known an entrepreneur that that succeeded by exclusively focusing on money. Okay, that that's where sort of things go, go arrive. In fact, sometimes they go off the rails completely, you know, and, and fail to self actualize, but if you can be guided by something bigger and higher, something meaningful, it doesn't matter what it is could be your family's name and legacy. You know, it could be your involvement in the church or community, it could be your love of the redwood trees, it could be wanting to solve COVID-19 with a vaccine or with swabs, whatever it is that you tether your sense of value added mission that will ignite your fire. If you are the type of person who is an entrepreneur, you become a catalyst, you look around the world and you don't see, you know, an obstacle is a beaver dams, you see, you see fresh tender, and you're going to be the catalyst and you're going to create a bonfire of opportunity. And so, so I think I think the relentless passion to me is the main thing. Everything else is acquirable. You know, people say, well, man, you either been lucky or required for something along the way. I always tell people, I don't think they're in B.A. So, you know, I actually have one real talent and I don't practice it all the time. And that is self actualization. And it just knowing the limits and boundaries of your capability and inviting other people to share your fire and have a growth mentality to engage with them, accompany them on journey and pursue a common objective in a common way. And I think that formula is so beautiful in America and every and we've been proselytizers around the world of it. I've seen Europe become more entrepreneur. I've been going to Sweden for 30 years. Then it means just 30 years ago. And now you have Daniel and Spotify and just incredible entrepreneur epicenter is all around the world. And so I think it's proliferating, you know, kind of in a beautiful and positive way. Love it. Well, we have five questions queued up already and more coming. So without further ado, let's go through them. Shall we? Okay, 11 votes. It says, what are the most important technological developments that you would like to see in the energy sector? And what can we do to accelerate progress towards them? Great question. In the energy sector, I don't know if that refers to sort of the conventional energy sector. I'd never really think of that way. I actually think of it as what technology are we applying to the physics of energy that creates a healthy, balanced output for nature and humanity's productivity. So so to me, it's not like, oh my god, here's a window and that's better than the cold thing that you know that's sort of a rudimentary mechanical substitution and it's important. I don't want to discount. I'll used to be a wind developer. So of course I love that. But but the but I think that to me, the most important thing right now is again to shift our thinking and and to say we are in a new era. You know, we the stone aged in infer lack of stones, the oil age will not infer lack of oil, but we just had for the first time in a history of oil and negative pricing, meaning a producer had to pay a receiver to take the product. Yeah, no place to put it. We are putting out more than we're taking. So we just had a first ever negative inversion. Now you can say, well, that's a quirky thing, but oil has been in the dog rooms for years and years and years. Thank God. That's where you know we created that whole movement on addicted to oil and an addiction is something that will kill you, right? I think we have you know with the lines crossed while I was assistant secretary where all these things became commercial, where clean tech was born were billions of dollars of capital formation happen and created whole new sectors that are now thriving. And I think that that you know it's not that we're at the end of that we have to keep those accelerations going, but they will once a profit once they become market driven solutions and aren't dependent exclusively on policy, they will self propagate. The bigger challenge now is to understand the strategy for how are we applying ourselves, which is the essence, the question and and and I think instead of applying ourselves to rudimentary systems that will fall of their own weight from from substitution. I think we have to say look oil is not the thing anymore data is the thing data is the new oil data is the drive of all value of all value and growth in the 21st century. So what is the energy consumption profile of data since it is exponentially increasing and and so if you ask me what's most important to me is it is it is getting on top of the the unchecked growth rate of data which is fine to stay unchecked because it is helping humanity compute in ironically is the way it is what the toolkit we will need to solve the greatest problems we have. But to do that we are suctioning unten counted for energy and not accounting for how that energy is a footprint looks. So the thermal efficiency of a semi conductor chip believe that are not at the smallest level what is happening in thermal efficiency that is driving the consumption of data centers is an all consuming thing to me. How do you get the thermal efficiency of the knowledge tool at the atomic level that is driving all change of value and growth in the world and and and be as vigilant about that as we are the drive train for a vehicle. How do we think about data centers and the building envelope and how the racks are stacked in the design architecture as visually as we have building codes and high efficiency LEDs for our buildings that that is kind of where I'm turning my hand the biggest challenges I think existed energy right now. Incredible incredible I heard once that we will run out of electricity in the UK if we continue to increase the data consumption rates in the UK like in the next five years so that's how much we're doubling and tripling our data usage so time energy and data is a bridge that I have not thought about so thank you for that. Next question will do you maybe two or three more. Jen says how did you keep that energy you had in your twenties until today. Oh that's so funny. Gosh that is a great question I do not know I've been accused of being a ever ready as an energizer bunny you know for most of my life so I don't know it's certainly not my certainly not the best healthy diet or something. So I think I think you know in my own case I guess you don't walk anybody issues I'm not a Tony Robbins type guru or anything but but I believe you have to have a sense of mission I believe you have to have a sense of purpose beyond yourself. And so you know I think the only you asked this question earlier which is linked to this about nature and my affinity for it the only place where I can truly be still where I can truly become in at peace and serene and deeply introspective is in nature. And so for me it is like a bomb that the pharmaceutical industry could not possibly device and and and so you know there's something magic about contemplating the aerodynamics and of a dragon flies wing or or the miracle of a chrysalis you know or or the dance of a bee. And and and so stirring myself in that way and fortifying my imagination brings me back to the same imagination that I was blessed with a long time ago and I just I never want to lose imagination or growth mindset my father used to say the day you stop growing is the day you start dying and I can see from my father is 90 years old that he's still working on growing he intends to live every breath until he dies. And and and that's sort of the journey I want to be on and so I think as long as you maintain a growth mindset and an openness to not not calcifying yourself and declaring you're done at any moment and and continually inviting new ideas and people and energy and positivity towards purpose that you'll stay very young. So good so good alright next one Jenny asks what is the most effective way to shift the public attitude record regarding the urgency of addressing these permanent environmental changes. Such a great question the the most important thing for me when you're desire a shift in attitude is not to presume that you are the subject of the action and the other party is the object of the action I have a solution and if only everybody else was as privileged to me with access to resources who had my education and were up the curve high enough if they were simply a smart record beyond par then the world would be better off you know I mean there in and and unfortunately regrettably many of the people I admire for the content of their message have a failure in the tactical delivery on that right just this sometimes to be perceived as self righteousness and and and and rather than a a helpful hand of out of generous outreach to bring people along and invite them to the right. So I think that's a great question for me to ask them into coalition in the mutual best interest of the common denominator of our humanity we end up in a condescension of separation quite often generated by some of the smartest minds simply saying you are the other and if the other was more like me you would be better. I don't believe in that approach I am from a different place and and and I believe in meeting people where they are and understanding the circumstance and the consequence of what is happening in the middle of our country and and and I and part of which is that they have nothing like the resources on the northeast corridor or in our cities on the west coast and and and so so to me the next time there is a proactive design in policy and and some form of exercise leadership in our country it ought to be and at unifying us and not unifying us around this is how smart I am and when you catch up with me will all be okay. If you're only as liberal as I am you'll be acceptable you know that is the wrong thinking for me I don't I don't think you'll ever ever ever win with that I think instead you have to say we are going to create a new era of prosperity on a on a bag of old tricks called the American free enterprise system and the boundless innovation of mother necessity being powerful for an idea whose time has come we're going to go back to that and everybody's all in and it's not going to be a new era of prosperity on a on a bag of old tricks called the American free enterprise system and the boundless innovation of mother necessity being powerful for an idea whose time has come we're going to go back to that and everybody's all in and it's not going to be a new era of prosperity on a bag of old tricks called the American free enterprise system and the boundless innovation mother necessity being powerful for an idea whose time has come we're going to go back to that and everybody's all in and it's that of concentrating the money exclusively on the epicenters and occur on the coast we're going to make sure that that is shared collectively across communities and we're going to bind up those communities with broadband so that everybody has equitable access to speed and everybody has equitable access to technologies that will liberate you and and remove all big clunky 19th century layers that separate you from the sunshine. And we can do this because we're Americans and we always have, but when we've done it before, we did it by design. We transitioned ourselves with thoughtful, equitable design that made us freer and thrive at a greater level. If you don't have a design, then you're drifting by default. And when you're drifting by default, you end up with this polarity and this very unfortunate animus. And then people are asking the question, how do I get over the animus? Well, the first thing is don't create it. Don't create it. Design for unity. And that may not be the answer you were looking for, but it's the one I genuinely believe in. One of my favorite Andy Kerster comments was, I think it was you said, you know, there's red states, there's blue states, we're actually just all purple, right? We're just one, right? When especially when it comes to questions of natural security. So time for the purple, time for the purple. All right. This is an easy one, maybe not depends. It's kind of an interesting one. Alex asks, what's up with the shirt from Scott, bass and bar ticac? Yeah. What's up with it today is it's got this really cool high dry thing. So I really like the way it wicks. You know, I was a little nervous. But Scott bass has the best pub down in Antarctica. That's important to know. I don't know if I've got time for the story, but the one of the greatest honors I had as an accidental tourist in public service was when they said, you know, someone's got to go and inaugurate the new South Coast station. It's been built over 10 years and it just got completed. And we need somebody from the science complex who will do it. And I was like, oh, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick. And everybody else took a step backwards. So they're like, okay, Kerster's going, he's on his way to the South Coast. They have two weeks down. So you've got a Christ church where we have the USA and ARTI program. You got to make Murdo station. And fortunately for me, we had an unbelievable three to four days of blizzards. So I got to hang out at McMurdo station. It was like, you know, to lay of game. And I'm hanging out at McMurdo and I'm learning everything about it. And of course, McMurdo shares its grid powered by diesel engines with Scott bass with the keyways. And you know, every day, you know, if you, if you don't know you about this, this to me is one of the greatest achievements of our country and its history, conserving an entire continent of this earth for nothing other than the betterment of science and humanity. We did that. We went down there as the only country standing after World War II was 17 countries exercising colonial claims. And we denied them all. We built a science station at South Pole. We built the biggest one at McMurdo where the historic explorers, Hutzwurr, and we said this continent remains open. It will not be exploited. It will not be extracted. There will be no mining. We will as a species come together. And that's why we have that best air quality mission. That's what we have the ice core sampling. So give us a millennia of data. Anyway, in that place, we opened up this thing from 10 years earlier. I got to go with one of my heroes, Dr. Neil Lane, who was a rice university with me, was the science advisor to Bill Clinton. And we're riding down there as C-130. We opened up the South Pole station inevitably, but at Scott Bayes, because I'm an energy guy, I went around, I checked out all of these l engines, and I'm like, that's what the diesel engines, with jet fuel that we bring in for the highest dollar in the world, other than what we delivered on the Afghan front, the highest dollar of delivered fuel, not even regular fuel, but jet fuel to power diesel engines to power incandescent light bulbs from leaking drafty cabins for our scientists. And I'm going, whoa, I'm the assistant secretary of energy. Are you kidding me? I've got this science mission, and we are just wasting money on all this logistics and overhead while I'm doing LED lighting and everything else. So in the last months of the Bush administration, I called up the National Science Foundation who run the base, and I said, have I got a deal for you? I want to give you. I'm going to go to National Renewable Avenue, and I'm going to give you some wind turbines where we're going to get rid of those diesel engines, and this is a great thing. But those guys in Washington, they're like, whoa, this is the ass-in, the Bush administration. I am not touching this. I got new bosses coming in, so they start slow rolling me. Okay? But if I call back up to you, I just sit back with Helen Clark, the Prime Minister of New Zealand on the way home, and I call back up and I say, look, if I got a deal for you, I can't get rid of these wind turbines with the guys across the street who are my colleagues and National Science Foundation. How about if we work with you guys to put up wind turbines onto the condition that you share them with McMurdo? So in that way, I made a lot of Kiwi friends, and to this day, I spent a lot of time with the Australian, the New Zealand Science Complex because they're just so good and so active, and I'm just so blessed to have taken part in their great efforts.
