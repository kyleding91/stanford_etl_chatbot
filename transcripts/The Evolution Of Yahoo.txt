 You were listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at edcorner.stanford.edu. For any of you who have been reading the newspaper, listening to the news this week, you know how lucky we are to have Sue Decker here with us today. She is the president. What's that? They were glad you were in me. Oh yeah, they're the folks at Yahoo said go home for the day. Well listen, she is a president of Yahoo and you can imagine this is a pretty busy week for her. And so we're going to probably get some really interesting insights into what's going on there during this very exciting week. It's a little bit of background. Sue Decker has been at Yahoo since 2000 and she started out as a CFO and has risen through the ranks and is now the president. And for all those students in the room, just to understand her academic background, she started out at Tufts as a computer science and economic students and then went on to Harvard Business School. So let's give her a big warm welcome. Sue Decker. Well thank you. It's great to be here. I was listening to the introduction. I thought your 2000, I think you guys were an elementary school or something at that point. So it just feels like yesterday that I joined Yahoo but it's always great to come back and see the bright eager minds in the room and thrilled to be here. It was great also walking around the campus and feeling like seeing the nice weather and everybody in backpacks. The only challenge was parking. Is parking really hard here? I parked in like special permit only. I'm afraid I'm going to get arrested when I leave. Anybody has a tag they can give me when I get out to go get my car off the tow truck. That would be helpful. So Tina just said talk about anything. So I'm not actually sure what I'm talking about. I think I'm talking about trying to think what might be interesting for an entrepreneurial class. And it seems to me that one of the things that you're probably all thinking about is going out and starting companies and creating really cool products and building businesses around that. And in fact that is how Yahoo started with two of your very own, Jerry and David. And it worked really well. But what I want to talk a little bit about is the power of actually focusing on the customer as the guiding light in everything you do. And that is, you know, customer fixation or customer centricity is something that's almost become trite. It's used so often. But it's really, really, really hard to do. And it's super hard to change if you don't start that way. And it has a lot of power in how successful your company is. And I think actually some of the problems Yahoo has had in the last few years are a result of very much focusing on products as opposed to customers and consumers. And we're trying to change that now. So I'll give you a couple examples. And then I'm happy to take any questions on any topic. I can't talk about a few of them. But when we're done you can ask questions on anything you want to whether it's in this presentation or not. So just thinking about what is important about customers that in our world we have three groups that we consider our constituents. Now only one is a paying customer. That's the one in the middle. These are the advertisers who bring to you free internet services. But on the left are the users all over the world. We have 500 million people that come to Yahoo every month. As we were a country, we'd be the third largest country. 500 million is a lot of people. And publishers and developers. So what a publisher is is Yahoo is a publisher. I just want to get the language straight and then we'll go from there. Publisher is any company that has inventory. Inventory are web pages. You guys generate them, consumers all over the world. But it's inventory that we can sell to advertisers. And hang on, let's say. So those are the three groups in what we call our ecosystem. And I'll come back to that. But publishers, advertisers, and users. And then of course developers are third party developers that might develop apps on the site. Very similar to what Facebook did recently where they opened up and attracted third party apps to innovate on top of their platforms. So this is what we, this is our little ecosystem. And it's going back to the beginning. Yahoo focused on creating some really, really cool products. And everyone who worked at Yahoo when we were small was very engaged in all parts of that process. They were very close to the customers. We tried to create something. David and Jerry started creating, helping people find what they're looking for, organizing the web at a time that the web was not organized. And at the time they were organizing porn slides, as you guys know, at Stanford. But it went into something much, much larger than that when they left. So in the beginning, it was very, very easy to do that. And we focused on developing the very best email service, best mail for finance, sports, news, groups. We got into search a little late. We outsourced early on to a number of providers, ultimately Google, helped them build their brand. That was one of our biggest mistakes in hindsight. But as you look at the landscape there, we developed a lot of different products. And then as you get bigger and bigger, and you're attracting audiences all over the world in order to organize and prioritize and make decisions, we set up sort of PNLs around you to these products. And that made a lot of sense. But as you get larger, it causes you to lose what's important to the user as a whole, who's looking at an integrated experience across many of them. So I'll come back to that in a minute. So there were basically three phases of Yahoo. Phase one from like 95 to 2000 was get big fast. That's where we went from zero to about 300 million users. And it was all about, we are very decentralized. We let push down decision making all over the globe in order to get our brand out there and attract users. This is a time when hundreds of companies are going public, capital markets were on fire. Everyone understood that the commercialization of the internet was a really, really important thing. It didn't know which companies necessarily were going to make it. And so financed a lot of companies. From 2000 to 2006, we went, I guess we got to 188 million in that first phase. We went from 188 to close to 500 million users. We became very, very strong in many of these, what I'm calling, user product areas. We also started to monetize what we do through media sales and search marketing. So what that means is if you look at any page, I know you're all familiar with this, but just set the table. There are pages that might have a text link ad that comes based on a search stream that you, user puts in. And then ads will be served back and they're noted as sponsored in certain cases. And the rest of the algorithmically ranked results are served. But then pretty much everything else on the internet is monetized through what we call display ads or video ads or even text link ads, but on inventory that's not search inventory. So these were that we had different groups of Salesforce focusing on display, video, text, anything non-search. We had a Salesforce focus on search. And we had all these products within the ONO, meaning owned and operated Yahoo Network that could be monetized. Phase 3 is where we are now, which is really flipping the model on its head and say, how do we organize around an audience independent of where they might want to go. They might care about search. They might care about sports. They might care about weather. But how do we think about all of our audience products and optimize for the whole, not for anyone individual? How do we think about organizing around advertisers and not make artificial distinctions about whether they're buying search or display ads because fundamentally what advertisers are trying to do is buy the marketing funnel. They're trying to at the top of the funnel create awareness for their brands. And as you move down the funnel toward creating a transaction, they can use different types of advertising, but search can be used for branding. It can also be used from direct marketing. And same with branding, it can be used in both places. So the last 18 months of Yahoo is about rebooting the company around these three groups. And it's everything from strategy to organization to process. And one of the things we found is our scale is our power, that's our strength. But the scale became a weakness because a lot of these things were not connected in ways that leveraged it and it makes it really hard to change once you get to that size. So these are some of the challenges that we faced. I'm going to start with advertisers, then I'll go to users and then developers and wrap it up. But one of the really important trends has happened, I'll give you some slides that show examples of this in a minute, is what advertisers started to want is to reach whatever consumer most wanted to buy their product. And it might be on Yahoo, but it might be on Facebook or it might be on AOL or it might be on Google, it might be anywhere. So the advertiser doesn't care whether they're buying a Yahoo set of properties, they're caring about reaching a demographic of chief household officer of women or men in a certain age group. So what happened was these ad networks started emerging. They include ad.com and other things like that where an advertiser can go to one stop shopping and the ad network then places their ad on any different publisher as opposed to our sales force which is going out and selling Yahoo. If we had organized around customers, if we had been organizing around someone thinking about where our advertisers are doing, what are users doing, we would have seen this earlier. We have leveraged ourselves into the number two ad network and we actually feel like we're in a position to transform the industry now, but we were late in that because we were thinking about selling display on Yahoo or selling search on Yahoo and we weren't thinking about the whole. It also made it very difficult to buy across search and display and that's true for the industry today. Google is really strong in search. They have their own search sales force. They really have nothing in display. Microsoft is not so great in either. Just the facts. So Microsoft is behind us in display and is number three in search. But in every one of these cases, you can't go to one sales force. If you're a client, if you're general motors and you want to buy internet ads, you've got to work through multiple sales forces at every single company. So there's channel conflict all over. It's really hard to do that. We have integrated our sales force. I'll talk about later, but we're the only company that's done that so far. It's very difficult to optimize across performance and brand. The question in the early part of the days of the internet was, should I spend money on the internet? Should I take money out of broadcast or newspapers and buy online? You can see the audience is building and building. There's a billion people every month right now that go to the internet in a world of six billion. Many of whom are kids or don't have access to computers. It's a huge, huge statement of the power of the internet. But it was very difficult for an advertiser to optimize across the two and get to the user as opposed to being stuck with various products that companies are creating. It's also difficult to measure effectiveness back in the day they're, you know, do I advertise on the internet? Now that is totally legitimate. Everyone, every major marketer, top 200 marketers are advertising on the internet and in fact hundreds of thousands are advertising through search marketing. So the question now is, how do I optimize? How do I know whether this one is better placed to advertise versus this one? How do I know about pricing? Lots of different questions there. So it's difficult to measure effectiveness. And the process of making a single buy is incredibly painful. I'll get to that in a minute, but it literally takes weeks if an agency or an advertiser says they want to buy a certain 10 million users across the demo, they're going to find pieces of that on multiple different sites. And literally, it's not done by computers, done by facts and phone calls. It takes weeks to place ads on the internet now, not in search but in display. So there's a lot of challenges. I think we saw this earlier than any of the other major portal companies, but we were, a lot of the ad networks emerged before we started getting going on this. So what happened after we did that? Well, the first thing we did is reorganize the company around an advertiser and publisher group, user group. And that alone had a very big impact in terms of how people were thinking into end. These are some of the priorities that we are focused on right now. We have seven major priorities. Everyone's totally aligned on this. We've decided this last fall. We funded it. And now we're rolling out products that are unbelievably cool, which you'll hear more about soon. But what that meant, our number one priority, sounds simple, but get the basics right. We looked at every step in placing an ad. How many different steps do you go through as an advertiser to place an ad? And how do you collapse that so it's much, much easier? What's the up time? From the time you submit, you create it until the time it gets up on the site. All kinds of areas for improvement. We integrated our search and display business. This was all of last year, 2007. We had our engineering teams come together, our product teams come together, our sales forces come together. That is really hard at scale to do. We changed incentive structures. We have two different sales forces. One was a team system. One's a commission-based system. How do you bring them together and have them be agnostic to go to market to sell, sell each? So there's a lot of background work for the publisher go to market. Analytics. We just bought a company, index tools that will help advertisers understand and publishers understand how to optimize better on their inventory. We just bought a company called Maven Networks that helps us with the video. So once we started thinking about the advertiser and what they need, it fundamentally changed almost everything we do. So the other thing that we did is we stopped thinking about Yahoo as a closed system where we're just trying to sell Yahoo inventory. We make the most money when we sell Yahoo inventory. But we started cobbling together a publisher network of other companies that didn't have their own sales forces or that did where we could help them. So we signed up a number of publishers. eBay was our first, started running advertising to supplement their auctions model. We added Comcast, we added a host of them. We're now the number two ad network. Meaning, if you come through Yahoo, you can get distribution on Yahoo and all these partners. We made AMP, which we just announced, our number one product priority, which I'll talk about more, but it's fundamentally changes the whole way buying and selling is done online. We hope to do for the whole online industry what Google did in search, and I'll come back to that. We acquired right media, which is an open ad exchange, like a New York stock exchange, where you can buy and sell openly and it will match the best ad to the best publisher in terms of yield. And we enabled you sell, we sell. What does that mean? Well, you think about all these publishers who may have their own sales forces like Martha Stewart.com. Martha Stewart has incredible audiences and they just don't have enough inventory. But we're now letting their sales force bundle their inventory with our inventory and sell it as a package. So it enables them to get a lot more money out of what they're doing. So let's just a couple of context slides to talk about what's going on in the online industry. This 2007 shows you that $43 billion is spent in advertising, $25 billion in display or listings and $18 billion in search. As you fast forward to 2010, that's expected to grow almost double to $78 billion, $22 percent a year. Search is going faster than display, but not a lot faster. 24 percent versus 19. These two are converging. This search kind of started later and it's caught up. And what you don't see on here is that off network is growing fastest, the fastest growing piece of this is off network display, meaning the companies that have their own inventory are growing a little less than 19 percent. But off network is growing up in the 30 percent level. That's what ad networks do. Here's just a quick comparison. I won't go through these, but search and display have really different characteristics, which mean that in display, it's actually more important to add some of these innovations than in search. This is highly fragmented. You sell multiple different pricing models, multiple different forms of targeting. In search, it's just an auction model, whereas in display, some advertisers want to know what kind of content they're running by, so they want guaranteed placement. So they're really different businesses, but they're coming together quickly. This just puts a little bit more math on all this. If you want to buy search, you can go to Google or Yahoo and get 90 percent of the coverage. You don't really need to go anywhere else, and Google is more than 50, actually probably 60 because I'm including off network. And Yahoo has a lot of Asia coverage as well. So it's a little higher than you might think. In display, the top 10 players are less than 25 percent. So in search, we have 20 percent of the queries that we're number two. In display, we have 8 percent in number one. So display is highly, highly fragmented. So it's a huge advertiser problem to buy distribution across multiple providers. So what Yahoo is trying to do is aggregate, we have 15 percent of all demand now, 8 percent of inventory, 15 percent of revenue. And we're trying to get up to 30 percent by adding these very high quality publishers, which ultimately we think will drive the pricing a lot higher. There's a massive distribution in pricing. Search costs about $30 per thousand, non-premium graphical about 50 cents, my space types of ads cost about 8 cents. If we can aggregate demand and aggregate supply and better targeting to display, we think we can push that whole curve out. Again, none of this would be possible if we weren't thinking about customers. This is the sort of last slide thinking about advertisers. This is the way it's done today. These are unhappy faces. These are the advertisers. They're trying to get distribution on publishers. And it's really, really hard. It's manuals, multiple touch points, totally fragmented, very opaque pricing in systems. But Yahoo is trying to do is we're going to offer the first web-based hosted application in which an advertiser can go to one place and get distribution on any publisher in literally hours compared to what takes weeks today. We just announced this will be rolling it out in the second half of the year. So those are some of the challenges for the advertisers. It's also really hard for the users in terms of how we first started. We have all these different properties, but they're very siloed. We have 20 plus different user properties, not a lot of integration. We are very closed outside development. So we may have the best finance site. We may have the best sports site. We may have the best news site. We do have all those. But we weren't really getting the power of the integration of the user across multiple sites. So we reorganized under one liter. And we are opening up Yahoo. So what does that mean? We're basically taking Yahoo and rewiring it so that we can be open to third party developers who can innovate on Yahoo. And very similar to what Facebook did, but on a scale that's much, much, much larger. So that is great because it both is if we can make it easy for developers to develop apps that get distributed all across Yahoo, that will help pay for our development. And it makes for great experiences for users because we're not going to innovate all the best experiences based on how much of the control of that is now in the hands of users. So I'm going to give you a couple of examples of how we're doing that. I guess one sort of example before I get here is when we think about open and social. Right? I don't know how many of you guys use messenger. I'm sorry, there may not be many in this audience that use messenger. But in messenger, we have a list of whether you're status, whether you're online or available or not. We are putting vitality feeds in there so that you could have a news ticker all the time to know exactly who everybody in your messenger, what they're reading all the time. And you can imagine if you can add that into context sensitive places like in sports. In sports, we have the largest fantasy sports site and we also have the leading sports site on the web. If when you're on sports, you can see what all your friends are saving, what they're reading, what they're sharing. It suddenly lights up the network in a way that we don't have right now. So we have all these different social experiences in Yahoo, across email and across messenger and groups, Flickr. But we have not made it easy to light up the whole network to make things very relevant for you. And it makes a big difference because I don't know how many people you have on your Facebook sites. But the more and more people who join, I don't know about you, I feel like I just say yes because I want to hear their feelings. And suddenly I've got hundreds of people on my Facebook account and then it becomes less and less relevant because I've got one news feed across everything they do. So the scale makes it less relevant. Well, if you can put context around that. So that you're lighting up vitality and social experiences within sites that have context, we think we can take the best of both experiences. Here's an example of how we open up search to third-party developers. We're launching this in another couple of weeks, but we've announced it. So right now when you do search, you get a bunch of blue text links, but they all look roughly the same. We're now going to allow third-party developers, whether you're looking for Hillary Clinton or Italy travel or Japanese restaurants. We're going to allow them to innovate on their listing. So you can see this listing is much richer. It has photo reviews, photos, send to a friend. It's rated. That will come up right in your search results. And we think that will make it much more relevant and people will click more, which will drive people back to the site, which ultimately will have them also click on the sponsor ads. So that's never been done. That's going to be launched very soon. That's called search monkey. Why is this indispensable? You can get things done faster. It doesn't take you as many links to get what you're looking for. For publishers, you can imagine open table if they want to innovate here and put some apps on here. It helps them target their most active users. It increases their traffic in a way that doesn't cost them as much in terms of search engine optimization. And for developers, it gives them access to the largest online community in the world. With 500 million people coming, it's a wonderful place, a great big sandbox that developers can innovate. Here's another example that's both open and social. So our homepage, Yahoo's homepage is the most valuable real estate on the web. This is several hundred million dollars of revenue a year. People come to our homepage multiple times per day. If we compare it to any newspaper or any other analog, it's extraordinarily valuable. What we didn't do in the past is open it up to third parties. We used it as a way to send people in Yahoo. You have all the links here in navigation. We send them to things in Yahoo. But some of the things we do are the best in the world, but we're not going to have them and awfully on the best idea. So what we've created are these buzz badges, and we've distributed them to our newspaper consortium. So as you're reading something really cool, you hit buzz and you rate it real time. And that gets accumulated. We just launched this a few weeks ago. And then it surfaces that content on our front page. So all the time, our today module is surfacing the things from all over the web that you guys are seeing, experiencing, pulsing that are very interesting. We have at salon.com, we got them to a million users a day for the first time ever. We are literally melting websites. Other publishers, because the traffic is so incredible by using the power of our home page. Why are we doing that? Because if this is more relevant, people are going to keep coming back, like your cup of coffee every day, multiple times to the home page, and we'll sell more ads. So theory, if you love something, let it free. It will come back to you. It's the model of search. You go to search, not because you think you're going to end there. It's the journey, not the destination. We're trying to make a lot of the Yahoo properties a part of the journey and helping people get to the right destination. This is just the voting page. Give us some more examples. This surface is the best stories on the web. There's a lot of good examples of that. So the third, the last part is what are we doing for developers? We talked about users. We talked about advertisers. Our strength is our scale. We have 650 million people coming a month, and 260 million of those log in. They spend, you know, 235 billion minutes, 183 billion page views. There's a huge, huge amount of scale in our numbers. And if we can have one platform that attracts developers so that you write one app, and it gets distributed to all of those users, that's fundamentally larger than any other site on the web. And we think that, sorry. We think that will attract a huge amount of innovation on our site. We're not set up to do that yet. We will be by the end of this year. Here's just examples as a user. You can take any third party app. You may want to see it in Yahoo Sports. You may want to see it on your phone. It will all be very seamless and is already being wired that way. So the last theme I'll talk about and then get to Q&A is, once you've defined these groups, the users, the advertisers, the publishers, and developers, how do you optimize around that? Fundamentally, if we have, it comes around insights. We know a lot about people based on the electronic fingerprints they leave on our site. We know what ads they click on. We know what search strings you do. We know where you've been before. If you're in a video site and you were just in autos, we can serve a much better ad and more commercial ad than if we don't know that. So once we have more insights, we can make more relevant experiences. That attracts more users. It also makes the users more relevant to advertisers because they know what the users care about and that creates a virtuous circle. So we're optimizing not just around any one of those, but we're trying to find the best users for a given third party developer and the best advertisers for that to develop this ecosystem and create a mode. So that is a quick run through of what we're trying to do in terms of rewiring Yahoo to be, to take advantage of our scale rather than be limited in our growth by it. I guess if there's a moral to the story, you got to develop just some of the things that just kick ass products. You have to have products that are going to change the world. But you got to start with knowing what your customers want and having a good lens of that. Sometimes the way a company starts is not the way the industry evolves and the industry in the internet evolved in a way that advertisers wanted to buy across multiple sites easily, not just across one. Users want to be able to surface the best content of the web. There's so many great ways where users can take control of their own experiences, do put up their own videos in seconds. RSS feeds are moving, servicing the best of the web on various sites. So by organizing around that ecosystem of users, publishers, and advertisers, we've been able to address a lot of those pain points. And I think there are some innovations that users don't know they want, customers don't know they want. So sometimes a product approach makes a lot of sense. But I think it always has to be integrated with a very, very strong way to signal and pulse with customers and not get far away from that. We are very focused on this. We have the half a billion users coming every month, but we're very focused on the fact that they can move to a new address overnight and that we have to earn their respect and make sure that we promulgate great experiences for them. So I'm going to stop there and happy to take questions on that or anything else at Yahoo. Thank you. Yes. As a daily user of Yahoo, I've got a problem with some of the email. And yet there's no feedback to be able to send to somebody of Yahoo. The suggestions on how they might improve their interface with the corporate website. Give me your name on the way out. No, we do have online help, but that is customer care is one of the areas that we're really focusing on. In that priority number one, get the basics right. I talked about getting ads up faster and taking steps out of the process. We also have a number of other priorities there and customer care is one of those. We actually had our highest customer care ranks in the history of the company in Q1, but we have a long way to go. And I'm happy to take your card and get you some help. But it's an issue that we need to focus on. Yes. So obviously the last few weeks have been very exciting at Yahoo. Can you give us a little bit of a back story of the discussions and what's gone on? Well, I don't know that I can tell you anything that's not been in the paper because our company leaks like a sieve. People are everywhere. As does Microsoft and everyone else involved. But it really just came down to price. I mean, it was fundamental. We're a public company and our board ran a process. We weren't planning to sell the company, but Microsoft came knocking. It's not the first time. They made it clear they wanted to buy the company. We felt our board felt that we are in the midst of this transformation. We actually published our three-year plan, which was the board approved last December, called for a relatively flat profit year this year and substantial growth in 09 and 10 because we're absorbing a lot of the development costs for some of the things I showed you today before the revenue ramps. So Microsoft's timing was really good. It was right at the low point. We had $19 a share. We had just put out our guidance for the year, which we didn't have guidance before that, but analysts have to figure out how to value stocks so they had their own numbers and they were higher than what we put out. There was a moment there where we hadn't gotten out to the street to talk to them about what we were doing. The stock was reflecting a lack of understanding in that. In fact, if you look at the projections that people were carrying, they were straightly lining out our growth rate, which was our lowest growth rate in revenue for many years and our lowest margin. There was a big gap. If you're firing a missile and you're growing a little off target, it gets farther away as the farther you go out. Stocks are all valued based on future. The forward look, not the past, but people were using the past as a benchmark because they didn't have anything better. So our stock got out of whack with what our board felt the real value was. And Microsoft has had, they've said this publicly. They've literally lost more in 10 years in money than we've made in 10 years. They've been trying very hard to invest in becoming a leading online company. And at the top of Microsoft, they've said things even three or four years ago about how Google has proven that you can give away software for free and monetize it with advertising. So therefore, they need to become the largest ad company in the world. And they just haven't been very successful because it's not about how much money can you throw at this. It's also not an industry necessarily that reverts to monopoly, like what they're used to. So it's about marketplaces. And advertisers want choice. And in the case of search, there weren't really that many alternative choices that were as good as Google, although I think we've made a lot of progress there. So it was a moment in time. It was an opportunity. They will say they offered a big premium based on where we were trading in the past, but it definitely was not a premium to where our board thought the value was in the future. And this went on for a few months and came down to the wire on Saturday, basically. I was in Omaha at the Berkshire halfway annual meeting and sitting next to Bill Gates, who's also on the board of Berkshire. And I got there and I reached over to Whittesburg and New Zealand. I said, should I kiss you hello? I said, well, people think we're getting married. And he said, don't, he stood up stiff, stiffly and shook my hand. That was when the 30,000 people at Quest Stadium were watching us on the floor of the stadium. But later that day, Jerry and David had been authorized by our board to go up there and deliver the price that they thought, as a public company, what is it worth? There's always a price. And there was a bid and an ask of about $4. And I thought, I didn't know, I actually would have bet more even money or more that I thought former would take it and we'd be having a different discussion this week. But they made a choice that that was too much. And we went back to work on Monday. So that's really where it is. It's, you know, I've had a lot of questions, a lot of interviews that could come back. I'm not sure what their options are. I think we have a lot of options. But, you know, we have to perform. And we have to deliver the, some of the things I've talked about today, have to change the industry in the ways that I've started to articulate. Or, or will probably will be a division of another company at some point. So, but I like that kind of pressure, the performance pressure. I want to play the game if we lose the game, Ference, where that's, that's okay. But we haven't had a chance to really do it. And we're just starting to launch it based on seeds we planted last year. Yes. So Yahoo has in the last minute, several years been one of the being appointers of small companies. And so he's talking to a group of folks that are interested in entrepreneurship. Okay, and how to have a price? So, can you speak to how you see those sort of acquisitions moving forward of small, either consumer web startups or in the advertising space? Do you see it continuing for Yahoo? It's pace of acquisitions. Any advice for those that are interested in being Yahoo? Interesting. Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. So, the question is, one of the ways Yahoo has grown is by acquisition of small companies. And many of the people in the room and in the ether who are listening will be forming small companies and will we be there to help you to buy them later? I think that's what the question is. And the answer is, you know, absolutely. Depends on, I mean, I think we have made, you know, dozens of acquisitions over time. We're really very disciplined about, we don't acquire things that we don't integrate. And I say that with a heavy recognition that one, I think the signal biggest mistake the company made in the past was not integrating over too fast enough. I think if we had integrated over too faster into everything else we did, we would have seen, I mean, we actually invented the click yield algorithm that Google has, you know, is beaten in the industry. We were slowed integrate and therefore we didn't see some of the innovation. And that's the first thing I did, you know, back in when I started an operating world back in early 2007, I integrated all the pieces of it, which is hard. It was, it has helped us have a broader picture and we think we're leading in a few things now. So, anything we buy, we will integrate. It has to be a natural extension of what we're doing. So if you think about that ecosystem I was talking about, if it's anything that would help us develop better experiences for advertisers, it could be, a lot of interesting companies around analytics of how do you analyze, return on investment across multiple sites as an advertiser, as a publisher, how do I manage yield, how do I take every pixel on every single page and figure out how to maximize its value, how much should be ads, how much should be content. There's a lot of good analytics companies out there. Add networks have been one of the hot areas recently. Those are slowing down a little bit because an ad network that is not associated with the insights that Yahoo and other companies have, does it ultimately have a lot of value besides brokering an ad? If you have a, if they have the insights they can develop algorithms that help match the very best ad with the very best user. So that area is slowed down a bit. No shortage of acquisitions. We acquired Mave in this year, which is a video platform company, Blue Lithium, which is an ad network that had a special ability to retarget a form of targeting. There will always be interesting companies out there that can move faster and may see something, and it's faster. And we'll be there with open arms and we have a few billion in cash. We're generating cash, so that's good. We're going to support open social, but I would say the approach we take will be broader than that. And we have such an enormous amount of users right on Yahoo that the apps people can develop on Yahoo will be extremely well distributed, but we're absolutely very open to others as well. And the core strategic initiatives we undertook when we started this plan about 18 months ago is opening up everything, whether it's our search platforms, whether it's the user sites that we talked about. We feel like the world has changed in a way. Early on Yahoo organized a lot of the world's information, but as the platforms have developed that allow users and anybody to be a developer, we'd like to tap the innovation of the wisdom of the crowds. So, yes. A couple of questions. First is you make your money on advertising, which is sort of the end of the web of what people consider discretionary in a downturn in the economy. And I consider myself that the downturn is coming. But your technology is so far ahead of what has been in the advertising world, you're chipping away, and a huge, even bigger bubble in a very successful way. So it's a little bit more of a obvious trying. My question really is, do you look at the economic environment either fearfully or does it affect what you do about major investments as you go forward and manage your business? Yes. So, the question is about the macroeconomic environment, the fact that advertising is cyclical has been in the past. And how does that affect our thinking about future investment? Certainly right now, with a lot of questions in the economy, with the dislocations in the financial sector, et cetera. So, we do, of course, look at that. And let me go backwards. So the point being raised is a great one, which is, let's start with advertising as whole. Advertising is a $500 billion business globally. I showed you it on the internet. It's about $40 billion now. This is closing in on 10% of the total, up from zero, you know, when it started 12 years ago, 15 years ago, as a commercial business. But most companies, when they think about how much money they're going to spend on advertising or marketing, they do a plan. And they think about how much their sales are going to be. And their advertising is one expense, their people are another expense, and you go on down the line. And then you come up with a profit number that you're targeting. And when things slow down, if your sales number goes from here to here, the quickest thing you can change is advertising. Because that's a lot easier than laying off a lot of people in the short term, and it can have in that quarter effect. So over the history of advertising, in kind of a slight lagging way, advertising has been somewhat cyclical with the economy. And that's true, and that's happening in traditional advertising. Now I think the secular forces on the internet are overwhelming the cyclical ones. That doesn't mean that we won't grow slower, but we're going from, you know, 25% to 15, not from 7 to 0, which is what a lot of the traditional media companies are experiencing. And in some ways, the internet is more measurable. You can calculate a cost to acquire a customer through a search or a display add very, very analytically. So you can kind of measure the economic equation better than you can in a tradition in a broadcast ad. For example, the whole famous quote from back in the 70s where, you know, marketer said, I know 50% of my advertisers wasted. I just don't know which app, so I'm sorry to find figured out. Well, on the internet, you can figure it out and, you know, how to manage that toggle. So I would say we are definitely seeing slower. I've said this publicly. If slower advertising in financial travel, retail, you know, if you think you drop the pebble in the pond of the housing sector and all the ripples are starting to affect other industries, we're starting to see some weakness in some of those categories. But we have had offsetting strength elsewhere. So we're pretty much, we had a good first quarter. It was a little better than what we expected. And we had reflected what we saw economically in our guidance back in January. And I would say it hasn't gotten worse. I mean, it seems like it came off a little bit and it's moving along a pace. I don't know what will happen in the future. But in the little petri dish of the internet, it's not moving in exactly the same direction as the broader economy. Maybe a little slower but not dramatic like what we've seen elsewhere. That's today. Ask me three months from now. I could change. Yes. A couple of years ago, netscape.com changed their homepage to user voting systems similar to what you were showing on your presentation. And as a result, the top stories at the top tended to be skewed towards Paris Hilton and Hollywood gossip and things like that. So are you concerned about alienating users who may not have the time or care to vote for what they want to see? But interesting question. I think that one thing that's important to notice, we are not automating our homepage. So when the buzz badges all day long are taking the pulse of what people like to read, we are not automatically moving that to our today module. We are also looking at what people are doing on our site and have other algorithms that factor into that. And then we have editors that ultimately choose because that's such an important piece of real estate that we don't want to have. If popularity might come at a quality discount, we don't want to do that. So we are trying to figure out scalable ways to surface the very best of the web and then overlay that with an editorial process that can make sure that we are monitoring that. So I don't know. I can tell you that since we used to be that our homepage, so the way this could move is today, the first step of it is what I described is we used to have one set of stories on the today module and we might change them once or twice a day. We started manually doing that to 10 or 12 times a day in the fall and our homepage traffic went up by 25%. And now that we just launched this buzz, it's in limited beta now and it's already been hugely successful. We're refreshing many times more a day. But if we ever saw that that were counterproductive, we would certainly pull back. The other thing that I didn't talk about that is more of an 09010 priority is we talked a lot about how the ads that are served are dynamically worked out by the algorithms based on what you know about user intent from their search string or what you know about them from which sites they've been in or demographics. Today, content experiences are static. So you go to the homepage and if you're interested in the Raiders and pro sports and someone else who's interested in the American Idol, you get the same result served. But as we know more about people, we're actually going to fundamentally, dynamically serve content based on what we know people are interested in. Same question could apply, but I think if we're really smart about using our insights well and also give users the ability to open or close that and voice what the choices they would like, we think that will make everything more relevant as opposed to less relevant or low quality. Yes? So there's not a lot of talk recently about the app sourcing part of it, search advertising time and goal. Can you talk about the app sourcing time and time and time and time? Yeah, so there's not a lot I can say on that. So after we got the Microsoft offer, it was incumbent upon our board to look at alternatives. So one alternative is standalone and generate the plan that we had talked with them and shared with them, talked with them about three months earlier. Another alternative might be to have someone else monetize our search. Another alternative, some of these are not mutually exclusive, might be to buy a AOL. Another one might be to buy a Myspace. So all these things have been talked about in the press. I'm not hopefully saying anything you haven't read, not confirming it or denying any of them, but there's a process of alternatives that were looked at. As a part of those alternatives, we conducted a limited test with Google results. On 3% of our search queries for two weeks, we used Google monetization to understand the gap. And we published the gap publicly that what we thought it was before the test and we thought it was about 100% difference before the test. That made me before we launched Panama, which is our search platform, and that we closed that by 30% last year, so it was roughly 70% left. And I would just say what I've said publicly is it confirmed roughly what we thought. Now, what does this mean? I don't know how closely everybody follows this, but I think of, there's two forms of search. There's the algorithmic results that you get back when the things you're really looking for when you use search. And then there's the sponsored results that you get back, which if you're searching something that's commercial, that might be a highly relevant result. Every time you click on a commercial result, Google gets paid or we get paid if you do it on our site. So the amount of queries a company generates across both algorithmic and search is what I think of as the golden goose. That's your inventory. That's the asset value. The size of the eggs she lays is how well you monetize them. How much do you generate for every single query? Every time you type in a search string for a new car, how much are we getting from an advertiser from that versus Google? Yahoo has very publicly said a few years ago that we did not monetize as well, that we were not getting as much revenue per query as Google. So there's a gap there. And we did not have a scalable search platform. We bought it from Overcher, which was like a sales and marketing company. I mentioned earlier that we didn't integrate fast enough. We have great engineering talent, but we didn't do that soon enough. So we were late with it. It's been out for more than a year. It's closed the gap by a third. The question upon our board and upon our management team is do we want to move quicker to close it, which is easy to do by using Google? Or do we want to continue to be a principal in search because it's a part of that broader advertising vision that I talked about earlier? And I would say we're very much aligned with that latter view. We actually think that because we are the only company with real scale in both display inventory and search inventory, we can create the same RPM advantage that they've done in RPS. So if we were to do anything with them, it would recognize that longer term that's our objective and we'd be balancing short term with long term. And beyond that, we've made no decisions. And we've been talking to them. I say set on Zarek Schmidt, set on his conference call. Yeah, we've been working with those Yahoo people. They're very nice. So we tried to say I was waiting for the moment on our conference call to say, yeah, those Google people are really nice, but the moment didn't come up. Yes. I was reading Valleywag. What are you reading now? So it had this article and it says that Jerry Yang rejected the book as a offer. He was out of a bad day. He's like, now he's in the repeat. Is there any else in the tree? I don't know. I remember that's an I had a bad day. No, there's no tree to that. Jerry and David were sent up as messengers to Steve on Saturday. And why? They're two, the largest shareholders of the company. But it's our board's decision and the board deliberated for three months. Steve Balmer put a three week deadline on it, which expired more than a week ago. And came back and there were some conversations. And our board decided what price they would sell the company. And then Jerry and David went up and told Steve the price and Steve said, no. That's the end of the story. That's what makes markets. Steve felt like in his words, 33 was the right price. Our boards walk away with 37. And usually deals don't fall apart for that reason, but this one did. So they didn't have anything to do with Jerry or David or anything else. But they're very much of the mind of you have to maximize value. There's a couple of companies which you have to do. Yes. You mentioned your acquisition of the EU platform. And that's now in addition to a number of other video products that you have jump caught in flicker video now. And I'm wondering, it would all suggest that you think that video advertising is going to start to be a real revenue generating business. Even more so than right now. And I'm wondering if it went, do you expect that to start? I think I've repeated part of these. Sorry if I've missed some. But the question is on video advertising and content. And what do we think about it? We have a number of video initiatives. Jump cut is a editing tool flicker video we just launched. And Maven is an advertising platform and content distribution. But I guess, yes. We think there's going to be a day where people don't talk about video versus text versus display. It's going to be like the air that you breathe. It's just a part of the experience. You don't think about it in a tangible way. But today, it's still because of broadband still getting to the point where the experience is really strong. And because it's a more complicated, both content and advertising sale because of the rights owners and their integrated sales forces today like a Viacom. So on the one hand, we are trying to consolidate our video experiences from a consumer standpoint. Back to, you know, being a product driven company, if we go to focus on the user experience, we should have a very integrated set of video products, not 25 of them. So we're really focusing on actually, by the end of this year, we will have dramatically narrowed down into one video platform, a lot of content experiences and players. Maven is really more about the advertising side and making an easy way to buy that. Sometimes they're linked, you know, and you could have in a YouTube video you could actually have before or after or in it a video ad experience or you could have a video ad experience on a static content page. We have a lot of those. So that, I really think of the content as kind of separate from the advertising in terms of how it's developing. But the advertising is about maybe a $500 million business, not quite even a billion. So out of the $40 billion business video is relatively small. There's a lot of reasons for that part of that is there's not a lot of inventory yet to run the ads in that are this video. So we're focusing on trying to take friction out of the system. We absolutely think that video will be integrated into every experience, every site, a longer term, and we're trying to position ourselves for that. We do have actually a really cool innovation. We have not announced them yet, but we're trying within the players. We're trying to come up with ways to make it as unobtrusive as possible. If you run your cursor over parts of the player, it will give you different signals. So we're working on that. Yes. It's wondering on the last slide about the image, but there's a really low switching cost for the end users. That's something that needs to be addressed. Google and Microsoft both have in their back pocket an office suite or an office type suite. I was wondering how the strategy you outlined that had trouble sort of understanding how that would affect raising the switching costs for the end consumer. Yeah, it's, we are not focused on necessarily any kind of app suite. We did by Zembra recently, which has fantastic email, sort of an Indian email, so people who can use your email from education all the way through you leave school and migrate onto a Yahoo mail. And it's hosted app. It's fantastic. But beyond, we're not trying to get into account, you know, business use of calendar or anything like that. I think the way we hope to become very sticky is by having, if we use our insights well on the content side, and you are finding what you're looking for because we know more about you and your preferences than in the other side given our scale and the breadth of what we do and igniting this vitality network throughout Yahoo. We think that the relevance will keep people coming back. And if you input information on, you know, if we have customized pages like my where you have all your stock prices or sports scores or as you commit yourself to a network, it becomes, it's not impossible to switch, but it's harder to switch because your experience is so good. So if we can get to the point where we can have the most relevant experiences on Yahoo, we think people will stay and at least come back. One of the things I didn't talk about is early on, we were focused on literally hundreds of different properties. We're really trying to refocus on what we call starting points and those starting points are search, mail, mobile, what am I missing, homepage, and maybe in something so, a social experience. These are the things people come to multiple times per day. That's where the best insights are. So we're 70% of the web revenue goes to those four or five properties. So literally, rather than dilute our focus over hundreds, we'd rather become really, really good at a few and then surface the destinations of all over the web and be a conduit to get to them. I think if there are very few companies with that scale that can help surface the best of the web at any given point and if we can succeed in that, we think people will keep coming back. So you have a whole bunch of acquisitions for lots of people. Do you think acquiring and being in companies that are slowing down the algorithm from the bottom of the market? The question is about acquisitions and whether they slow the company down. I think they do both. I think they speed you up in certain areas because the time to market is a lot faster if you acquire a company that's already up. But to get the value of it, you really do need to integrate it. And that does take some time. I think net net, we evaluate that every time we look at acquisitions. And when we make an acquisition, we think it will speed us up in a key area that we feel like we need to supplement. I think if you don't integrate, in the end, you don't get the power of the scale of Yahoo. And that's the asset we bring. Yes. So here, Charter, I was written advertising in a similar way currently in mobile advertisements. Not many, but by 2010, you created a few like a student in all their industries or something like that. What are, like, do you think advertising on mobile is actually viable in the third? That's a great question on mobile advertising and size scale viability. Those are not our numbers. Those are third party numbers. Personally, I'm not sure. I, as I said to Marco, Boris, who runs our mobile business. We're a leader in mobile by a good measure. It's fantastic products. We have footprint. Now that it hits 500, 600 million people in the world, they don't all use it, but they can from business development deals. And I can talk more about that in another time, but I am not sure yet whether mobile is a service or a business. And what I mean by that is we have to have unbelievable mobile products because people's lives are moving to mobile. In many markets around the world, countries, people start with a mobile experience. And people feel very affectionate and personal about their mobile devices. Something like half of the people that have them sleep with them at night. And most people do have them don't share them with their partner. So it is, you know, the stats on mobile are really fascinating. And you have to, because the form factor is so small, you have to find what you really care about on mobile. You can't have a lot of extraneous stuff. So for that reason, both the content you serve and the advertising, there's a much higher bar. If we don't have great mobile experiences, people may leave our PC experiences where we generate a lot of advertising because they want an integrated experience. They may want a different visual experience, but they want to be able to access that stuff. So we are hard at work making great mobile experiences, but I don't know how big the advertising market is going to be. And I think it will develop, but I think it's going to be slow. Any last questions? Two more minutes? I think there's any last questions otherwise? Yes. Do you see room for any subscription model service such as the Wall Street Journal, or do you think we're going to move towards exclusively advertising based records? So question is the models subscription versus paid? I don't think there's going to be one answer. I think, you know, you look at traditional media, newspapers are 80% advertising, 20% circulation, magazines are 50, 50% broadcasts, it's almost all advertising cable is a mix. I think, you know, people will pay for great, very specialized content that matters to them. And I think there'll be a market for that. I think the bigger market will be advertising, but I think there very well will be markets for subscriptions or pay for the song, pay for the content. So I don't have a clear vision about what the mix will be, but I think both will be out there. Yahoo's primary focus is on advertising. All right. Thank you.
