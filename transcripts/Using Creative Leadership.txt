 I want to introduce our wonderful guest who came all the way from Memphis to be here. I mean, that's really a long way and we really appreciate it. We have Frank Ricks with us. He is the founder and the Managing Principal at, I want to make sure I get it right, at Looney Rick's Kiss. I love the name of that firm. And the company was founded in 1983 and it has grown into a remarkable architectural firm with seven offices around the country. And the most interesting thing I think in talking to Frank beforehand is that his background isn't formally just an architecture. It's an architecture in engineering and in design. And I think that you all will find this very interesting. He's got his wonderful pictures of a lot of his projects and we'll share a lot of his insights with you. So without further ado, Frank Ricks. Thank you. Good afternoon. Delighted to be here. It was a long plane ride but Mike has been showing me around the campus. It's a great place which I've always wanted to see the campus. I've been in this area of the country before but never been able to visit the campus. And it is a great place and that's what we do or that's what we attempt to do anyway in our business is create great places for things like this to happen and for people to interact and technology to interface with. Sort of the, I call it the bowls of life. The architecture, the spaces that we create in the places, the spaces in between the buildings. That's where the human activity takes place and that's what drives us. It's not about the buildings. It's about what happens in and around the buildings. So that's where hopefully I can make some of those connections for you that might be wondering why the world is an architect here talking to me this afternoon. So Mike tried to give me a little bit of guidance on how to do this. I'm going to ramble here for a few minutes. And I did bring some images because it's hard as a designer and an architect to talk without something to point to in terms of an image. So we'll do that in a minute. So just bear with me while we run through some background issues that have to do with leadership and entrepreneurship and just sort of how we got started and what we did and how we're still learning and every day with something is new and different. And I think that's part of what makes life and business fun. I'm a small town kid from the south if you can't tell by the accent. Country boy and that sort of gave me a self-sufficiency as a kid. My dad was a machinist and he could make just about anything. So I grew up with this attitude that if you don't have it you just make it. And I think that influenced me ultimately about going into business as far as else is that you just do it. Interesting little, at about eight years old I think about entrepreneurism. My dad had a big garden, huge garden we lived on about five acres and he had this really big garden and I helped him every year plant it. And eventually one day he said you want that piece of dirt over there for what? Plant in your own garden. Why would I do that? What's the most important thing that you can do when you plant years? Well you might be able to grow your own vegetables that be yours and then you could harvest vegetables, put them in your wagon, take them up the street about a mile up the highway to the new subdivision where all the new houses were and I bet some of those folks would want those vegetables and maybe you could sell them, make some money. So I thought okay, so I did it. Plant it, you know, nurture the garden, harvest the vegetables, put them in the wagon and I was amazed. I'd pull the wagon up to the door, ring the doorbell and I was scared to death. First lady opened the door and she said what do you want? You know thought I was selling something and I was. But then I said I got, and all of them did was show it to her. She said oh great. And so I started telling vegetables that eight years old making money. And I had lots of jobs and that experience with my dad did sort of set me probably the wheels turning that I'll do this again somewhere down the road. As Tina said, went to the University of Memphis which it does not have an accredited school of architecture yet. We're still working on it. We've been working on it for 30 years and I think we're really close and understand you guys are starting something here. That's great. Because again architecture affects a lot of things in a lot of ways, all of us in some way. And so I think it's really important. But beyond that just design and so when I went to school at U of M it was actually in the engineering college and it was architectural engineering and technology. And so there's a strong connection to in my education to the engineering disciplines and the collaboration of all of that trying to put all these things together. That had a big influence on us. Both of my partners are graduates of the same program. So in some ways we like to say we're not traditional architects because we didn't go through the normal pipeline. And in fact a lot of people thought we wouldn't make it because of that because we weren't. We didn't have the appropriate pedigree at the time. What we did have was a passion for what we do and we actually thought it was beneficial that we had the background that we had in terms of this multidisciplinary exposure to the world and problem solving not just pure architectural design theory. So to us it's not does it look great as a piece of architecture in fact that's kind of somewhere down from the list. It's does it work does it some of the purpose does it add value to people's lives does it add value from a business perspective and that's how we began our careers. Carson looney and I met at school and just sort of kicking around the ideas and I'm sure some of you are having the same conversations. It'd be kind of cool to have a start of business wouldn't it yeah. Eat some more pizza drinks some more beer have the same conversation over and over again for months after months not really serious in some ways partner. You know in the back of your mind serious but not really because you didn't know how you were going to get there. We had those conversations long enough and frequently enough that we began to believe it. And so as an architect you have to be registered to practice it's one of the you know what five professors professions where you have to be registered by the state each state licensed architect. So you can't just go out and do architecture without going through an internship and then getting your license and being approved to practice. So we had to get through that her also time went by and we work together and we started getting closer to this idea. And we began to say well if we pass the exam maybe we start the firm and so we got within a year and we decided we'll take the exam this is like six years out of school and we'll start the firm. It's just that simple and then we thought what if we don't pass then why and then we thought do we really know enough to do this. Well we don't know we haven't done it before. So I was working in a firm and met a guy there that I like working with a lot Richard kiss and Richard seven years older than Carson and I. And so we thought we could use the experience the technical knowledge and he already had his license so that was our backup plan. If we didn't pass the test we could still open the firm so we got our test results back in September of 83. And fortunately Carson and I both passed and we started the firm December or sorry December third 1983 so we'll be 22 years old in about three weeks. So we started out as three and the game plan was really to just see if we can last for a year. We said if we can last for a year. We'll probably make it if we don't we'll go get a job somewhere else. It was really that simple we were talking like we were talking earlier and I said you know it was I'd like to say there was some bigger grand plan but it was very it was just believing in what we knew how to do and that we really wanted to do it. And also part of it was the firms that we worked for didn't really have a clear path to allow us to do to quickly put ourselves in leadership positions and ownership positions. And I speculate sometimes that if the firms we work for had that sort of avenue that we may not have started the firm I don't know. It's hard to say but I know that had a lot to do with us deciding we were going to try it and if we if we failed we'd we'd start over somewhere else doing something else. So we mortgaged Carson I actually had a house that we had renovated together and we sold the house split the profits and and and we use that to live on for the next six months. We didn't take a salary for six months and made a whole lot less money that first year than than we had the previous years and Richard was married in his wife took a second mortgage and that's how we started the firm and it was just that simple and we had diverse backgrounds in project types. Carson had focused a lot on single family housing and small commercial restaurant banks that kind of thing Richard had a lot of institutional hotel big project experience. I'd done a lot of healthcare work hotels office buildings and I had traveled a lot in my work previously and had contacts in other places besides Memphis and so we thought surely the goodness between the three of us we could scratch out a living for a year. And that was the game plan so we started really as as general practice architects and this was a made a little note here. Let me back up but so we started planning we really got serious about nine months maybe twelve months max before December so it would be 82. And we started meeting and talking and doing the business plan kind of just really scribbles on paper nothing exotic although we did go to a Saturday morning small business administration seminar on how to how to start your business but we bought a. We showed out our own cash and bought in advance of opening the firm a Texas instrument 888 processor with a five mag hard drive PC. And like no one else had we were like on the cutting edge of the architectural firms in Memphis because no one had this we were still doing this was long time ago. And a dot matrix printer and we started learning all it was it was you know we were we were doing the technology thing early on and that was that was a we were real proud of our ability to be able to pull that off with this little toy that you know had had less power than my watch does. The other thing is we did several years after we started the firm and we were successful somebody said I can't believe you guys started the firm right at the end of a recession. Was there a recession we didn't know there was a recession there was a recession in 82 and 83 the firms we work for had plenty of work we didn't know there was a recession but now I've read so that was one of the you know it's pretty significant recession in the scheme of history since the depression we didn't know we just started we had work we thought we could get work we just started and we. The first project that we had we actually made happen we knew a land owner and we knew a property owner that own some land and an old warehouse right on the bluff in Memphis and we knew a developer that wanted to do a downtown project and we put them together. And we may and so to in my mind even though I'm not the developer we're practicing we started creating this spirit of entrepreneurism in the firm early on about how do we make things happen how do we make deals for everybody so it's a win-win situation and so we put them together in a matter of a month we had our first large project there was a 12 unit kind of project right on the bluff looking over the Mississippi great project. So we started in December and I think it was in January the developer called and said he was putting the project on hold we thought it was over we thought we thought we were looking for jobs already but we were able to keep going with the little bit of work that we had in these different market places and and it survived and we began to build the firm and build a staff and grow it and so our game plan besides lasting a year was and we did this is one thing we talked about a lot. Over the pizza beer. We said if it works we've got to have a strong team build a really strong team and very thoughtfully build the team because we knew that made the difference from the places we had worked in the past when the team was not strong and not composed properly it created problems and weaknesses and that we thought would undermine our success. We wanted to share responsibility not just between the three of us but that was part of it but with anyone that was in the firm we wanted to push down. And to let people grow up we said we want to share information a lot of firms. In a lot of firms still do this particularly in architectural business they don't share with the staff financial information contractual information they just sort of give them pieces of work and they do it and they give it back and we we never thought that was a good thing. And we said we're not going to do it so basically we share everything there is to know except for personal salaries and bonuses if anybody can see anything we put reports out there every bit of our business is open to the entire staff. We also said we're going to share profit. We said if we're going to expect these things out of the people that work with us the team that we're building we have to share the reward because we felt like that would sustain the firm because again that was part of the reason we were leaving the places that we had been employed we knew we were making things happen there but we weren't we didn't see the return on it. We wanted to share ownership not just share the profit but literally have people invested and say they're owner they own stock in the firm because I believe owners act differently than non owners in particularly in a service business we don't make anything all we have all we have as designers to offer because we don't produce contractors build buildings we don't architects design them so all we've got is what's between the ears of everybody in our firm. And so we wanted that ownership level because we think that makes a difference and we're not you know that's all we're selling is that intellectual capital and I believe owners respond differently to situations. And then the last one which is actually perhaps most important but these others are fundamental underneath our operation of our firm but we really we wanted to do really good work if we couldn't find the right kind of work and we couldn't build the right kind of team then we didn't want to be in business it was important to us not to just have a business and make money. It was to do really good work and to continually to advance the work that we did and essence make better places and we again we started out as a general practice architectural firm it was all about the buildings and not so much about what happened in them or between them and the places created it was just about the object. And I'll talk to you more about how we have evolved and sort of I say matured into the different kind of designer that's more about the people. So just some real quick statistics about we started in 84th in of 84 we had about seven people just from a growth standpoint in 85 we hired a guy named Darrell Russell he became the fourth principal and so we tested this. I had the idea of sharing ownership Darrell said I can't stand doing these buildings I got to leave I'm leaving the firm but we knew Darrell was extremely talented he'd been with us about two years and we had him doing roof details and wall sections of the building shell I said well Darrell we don't want you to go what do you want to do. He said I really like doing interiors we were doing an incorporate corporate interiors project he said I love working on that corporate project the interiors I said okay so why can't you do interiors here he said well we don't really do that and I said but we didn't do that. We could when you look at me like how does that happen and so you know the conversation goes and finally I said Darrell what do you need to start he said just do it you build interiors and he said well I'll need some stuff I said what kind of stuff. He said well first thing I need are some shelves for what to put the binders of carpet and wall covering and all you know all the stuff that interior designers have to have so we I proved not very formally three three foot shells that we hung on the wall that was beginning of our interiors practice Darrell grew that practice to the largest interior design group in the middle mid south we call it around Memphis three state region in the mid south it became most profitable group in the firm he became principal in the firm and owns. He's the third largest stockholder in the firm right now and so we made it work and which then set this you know that was our test we now have eleven principals we have several senior associates and up until last year about anywhere from 40 to 50% of our firm own stock in the firm now everyone own stock because we started an e-shop and we still make additional offers to key people that so they have a higher level of ownership we think that's absolutely at the bottom of our six hundred percent of the stock stock is a big success because they they have a very vested interest in it so that stock still happened in eighty eight at the end of ninety three we were thirty three people that was our first really big significant job in terms of a corporate headquarters that sort of launched us and from there over the next five years we grew to about 160 people which I know here on the west coast you guys have heard some of the stock stock that we have in the business and we have some really wild stories about rapid growth and we don't have anything to compare to some of the dot com companies but going from thirty three to a hundred plus people in a short period of time was just absolutely exciting and gut wrenching and scary and worse out and just it was crazy I mean we were hiring people as fast as we could find them and occasionally we made mistakes because we thought we had to have people more than we had to have the right team that was a mistake it's better to turn the work down in our opinion until we get the right people to do the job if we're if our focus is on quality so we learn lessons through all of that it was it was a big it was a very short when we chart the ride it was very it was a steep growth curve and we landed a lot of big jobs something you might find interesting since you guys are focused on technology a lot is we ended in ninety five we get the world technology center for FedEx which is based in Memphis and that was that was absolutely fascinating we actually did it in collaboration with Gensler who's based here in San Francisco we work with their Houston office but basically did a million square feet over about three year period and it was a culture change for FedEx they had typically not had the kind of spaces that we were seeing with sun and HP and a lot of the tech companies out here so we came and visited and we looked at what was motive and there their issue FedEx had this issue of attraction and retention in the delta in Memphis how do you get how do you compete with the brain power here or Boston and so part of our job was to how do we help FedEx change their culture to allow this new building and facility totally different from anything they'd ever done that sort of broke all of their rules in fact a lot of people internally were saying it would never happen and I think part of it had obviously the client part of the client anyway wanted to do it part of it was putting together this multidisciplinary team that was focused on helping them change their culture not on just how do we build a building I'm telling you that story because we went from building buildings designing buildings I should say getting them built to helping our clients solve problems and connect the dots because bringing this we bring in a team of different disciplines of designers and they're asking questions from all different angles and out of that come it's very much I should acknowledge I do I mean it's we use the I do tape how many people seem to I do a night line tape we use that internally to that when we saw the we said that's our training tape I mean that's what we try to do that whole idea of bringing everybody to the table stakeholders facilitating that process and out of that usually some magic comes and it's not the magic about you know what's the wall made of and that's all part of it but it's really how do you what's the purpose of the building what are the people doing in it and what sustains it long term and you know you talk about those kinds of things forever but it was that was sort of a pivotal project creative force as well and went on to do a variety of things what happened and I'm going to switch over to this we along the way so we've added partners along the way we started do we open office the first all second office in Nashville and then Princeton Princeton was actually a planning office we grew from just doing buildings to this idea of connecting the dots on a different plane and we found ourselves needing to do plan actually planning the sights and we'll make sure that I am it. sites and the places before we worry about buildings going in them because if we get the plan wrong, it doesn't really matter if the architecture is good or not, we're not going to end up with a good place. So we merged with a small firm in Princeton and they lead our planning and urban design group and then our other offices became established because of clients and also attraction and retention of staff. It's not about geographical conquests. Really every office we have outside of Memphis is about attracting and retaining people because we have the right people, we actually find that the clients will come. It's about the strength of the team for us. Because again we're not selling anything, we're not creating it and then we're putting something out for people to buy off the shelves, we're actually selling it. Every project we do we're starting over with that whole process. So we find ourselves now in this place of what we call place making which is kind of a buzzword for these things, these days the work we're doing in terms of having, composing the places in the buildings in a way that creates some intrinsic value, much like the campus, there are places on this campus that are much stronger. The whole campus is great but as we were walking around today some places feel pretty good. You turn the corner and it feels absolutely fantastic. There's this intrinsic difference in about how that space is composed. It's sort of the same thing with an iPod. That thing feels good in your hand, it looks good. I mean it's designed, that you can hold it, touch it, lots of technology devices, you know the IDOs and all that. It's a tactile thing and it's something you can hold, architecture and urban designs. You can't put your arms around it but people know it when they're there. If I ask you all to think about where's a really good place you like to have a dinner, a sidewalk cafe, where do you like to vacation, where do you, you know, give those images in your head that are just favorite places that involve built space. Sometimes it's hard to put your hand, your finger on exactly what it is. You just know that it's good and it stimulates you in some way. That's really hard to write a formula for. There's nothing in a textbook that tells you exactly how to do it. There's no business plan for it. It just takes getting the right people in the right place with the right client and it all clicks. So it's hard. Every time we start a project we're having to sort of reassemble all of that. So these, so here's just running through real quickly. Ten minutes here and we'll hit questions. Our work now ranges from like on the left, that's a hundred city blocks of urban redevelopment and restoration. Two projects like on the right that are hundreds and thousands of acres of rural landscape, greenfield kind of development. How do we do that in a responsible way? How do we create that quality of place? How do we put the quality back into the urban redevelopment? We work on projects that range in scale and from traditional and residential to contemporary and modern and corporate. From private sector to public sector and institutional, entertainment venues, civic and educational knowledge based venues, we help restore historical assets, build places that people are motivated to improve their lives through their physical wellbeing and spiritual wellbeing. This on the left is for people that are down on their luck and need a good place to stay and deserve a good place to stay to places like on the right where people are up on their luck and have are living a good life in the Neopath Star ski resort to stay in. So it's a range, you know, it's in, you go from one extreme to the next. The issues are still the same. People are people and the delivery process has similarities but you have to get there in a different path. Every time we're doing this, it, we're starting over. Which for me is the entrepreneurial spirit that drives us. It's like we're starting over and creating, we're not creating company but we're creating this solution for our clients that is unique. And so for that reason we evolved, this evolution, we started out as architects, I'd say we've evolved into planners and interior designers and we've really matured into urban designers. So our company, I could chart and show you how we've made these phases. It affects the projects we select because not every project, not every owner, every client will let us do this. But we're trying to find ways to do these kinds of things at all price points because we don't think good designing good places should be limited to just those that are extremely well off. We think there's a good, we can do this and create good environments everywhere. These are places that are focused on technology and places that are focused on individuals and human beings. And so we find ourselves now in this place where we're mixing all these different project types that we sort of grew up on knowing whether it's an office building, it's a hospital, it's a hotel, it's a single family house. And we're putting them together because the, well a lot of cities now are mandating that rather than segregating uses, you put them together in mixed use environments. You know where you have ground floor, retail, restaurant, people living above all that, you have a lot of that here in California. It's not so prevalent around other places in the country, East Coast, West Coast. So it's being mandated and something like thousands of acres we're trying to, this on the left is actually scripts, research institutes relocating or starting center in South Florida and this is 4,700 acres basically creating a new city around that will support a track and retain the people that work and support that scripts institute. And what makes a good place to create impromptu interaction that's going to help spark the next thought that solves the next biotech dilemma that they're dealing with to urban renewal projects. I dug this out and dusted it off because we don't show this but we still say it. This was, you know you read the books and it says okay if you're going to start a business you got to have, you got to have the mission statement. Well it was years before we had a mission statement and we had some people internally trying to help write it and it always came across as this marketing thing and so I resisted. We don't have titles, we didn't have mission statements and we still don't really have mission statements. But this was the first thing that we ever came up with that everyone agreed, all the principles agreed, that's what we're about. We're in business to design and I think advice to you if you're thinking of starting business or helping one grow is to be real clear about what you're in business for. So the number one thing we're in business for is to design. We want to make money, it's not profit, it's not other stuff, it's about we want the opportunity to design and we can elaborate and say it's good, we want to do good projects and all of that but it's just simply to design, that's what drives us to create things. And certainly the second one, we want to do really good work and we built our firm on really on the issue of practicing good services and clients because they do have a choice because we're not selling products, we're selling services which is a different animal than perhaps some of the speakers you've heard from where something's created and then it's marketed and sold, we're selling service. And then we aspire to be a place where everyone in our firm can seek their potential. Not everyone's going to be a principal in the firm but we want them to go wherever they can seek their spot and we can't always have a spot for everyone but that's our goal. And then a few years ago we decided that wasn't enough so we actually decided rather than a mission statement that we'd get into values and these I won't read them, you can read them yourself and you can tell there's a connection to those first three that we did a long time ago. And this became important as far as your companies grow there's an issue of culture transfer. When there are 10 people in an office that's smaller than this auditorium you don't have to write this stuff down. Everyone hears it, they feel it, they breathe it, it's just in the room. When you grow outside of more than about 20 people in my mind you start having this issue of how do you perpetuate the culture? What are you in business for? What matters? How do I make a decision? How do you, if we're all working together, how do you make a decision that you think is in sync with me? All those things become amplified. And then when you start another office you have another location it goes up exponentially. And so right now for me as managing principal one of the toughest things that I have to do is try to figure out a way to perpetuate the culture that made it successful. Because we're pretty confident that what we figured out how to do works, our clients tell us it works. In fact we have one client, he told a reference, he told a prospective client, he said I don't know what they called, what do you think about LRK and he said they're not good, you know, you ought to hire them. He said well what is it? I don't know what it is they do, they just do something extra. There's something sort of magical that comes out of that and there are no secrets in our business. It's just look you in the face, eyeball to eyeball and do the right thing and say, you know, in work hard and create good work and deliver value above and beyond that. Now having said that, we are actually, we've in the past couple of years come up with ways to try to tap into the value. We know for example, and when we started off, we're competing with all these other architects and it's kind of commodity driven. Like somebody says I need a set of plans, well we don't think of it that way, it's a design process, but a lot of our marketplace thinks of it as just giving me a set of blueprints and we don't want to work on those kind of projects because that's just somebody is just looking for a quick answer. And so we've tried to distinguish ourselves in a lot of different ways and we've had some failures along the way that I can tell you about if you're interested in terms of where we tried some things and it didn't work. But trying to set ourselves apart, we've found that this mixed use urban design, place-making thing, there aren't too many firms that do that real well and that can do from single family to this range. So we're putting that in a package and what we're trying to do now is figure out a way to base our compensation on the value that we know we're adding because we've had our client, we've seen it and we've had our clients tell us that what we're doing, they end up, they either rents faster sales at higher price, the velocity of the sales is higher. So how can we get in on that? Well we started thinking about let's participate on the back end so to speak when their project sales, when their developer sells their product, whether it's a condo and office building, that's when they make their money. So their goal is you have to think of your clients business model. Their goal is spend as little money as I can until I can get the product out there whatever it is and then sell that for as much as I can and that's where, and that's simple business. So for us, we're front-end expense to a client. So we have to think how can we do this differently? So we sometimes don't follow normal sort of architectural, cultural, you know, professional culture, I mean, in terms of we package it, we don't try to sell them A to Z on the front end. If they only need A to B, we'll do that with price at increases but we take part of our conversation on the back when they get paid, they're glad to pay us because that's when they get paid. We're just working into the clients model. It's different from selling things retail but that's just a dynamic of any service business you have to really dig into what is your client, how does your client make money? How can you support the client? Help them be more successful at what they're doing, whether it's making money or whatever their goal, it's really understanding the client's goals. In fact, that's how we make decisions now about the clients that we're taking. What are their goals, what are their values, if they're in sync, how can we help them be successful? And we think we've figured out some things and ways to do that and first is have a lot of good talented people. Then they see the difference and they're willing to pay us. It's one of my favorite books anybody ever heard of orbiting the giant hairball? It's a great book, easy read. If you go to work in a corporation of any size or you start a business of any size, I recommend you read this book. It's written by Gordon McKenzie who used to work for hallmark, creative director of hallmark cards. It's a fabulous book and it's about the hairball real simply. The hairball is anytime you have two people together, you start to create a hairball. If you're all by yourself, who's to argue with? You've got your in control, your rules, your game. You put two people together, three, four, five, six, ten and somebody's in charge, there's something that gets created and when you build a large organization, you start having to have rules and there are federal regulations and all these things and it starts to bog down. That's what Gordon McKenzie was saying is the hairball. So the goal, particularly creative people, that's the last thing they want to do is to get sucked into the hairball. So the other big piece of my job is to try to minimize the hairball so that the creative folks are flying out around it and they're doing their thing and not get bogged down with the infrastructure. And I think that's true in a lot of creative fields. So real quickly, I just wanted to show you this building. It's not a great piece of architecture but it's an example of sort of thinking through things differently and how architects can play a different role. But this is all about technology. This is a FedEx Institute of Technology at the University of Memphis. At FedEx decided we need to grow some people like you're growing here at this institute. We need to grow them in our backyard. FedEx is based in Memphis. I didn't say that. So they made a grant to the school or a gift to the school and we had just done the World Tech Center and I really wanted to do this project. In hindsight, I still am glad I did the project, worked on the project but it was painful. We went through three deans and it was just a nightmare in a lot of ways because it was breaking all the rules. It was about, this is a state institution. They got lots of rules about facilities, about how things are taught. This was about breaking the rules and creating a new paradigm for teaching business and teaching interdisciplinary skills to students, to have business leaders come in and participate and mix private sector and education in public sector. So it was a real challenge. It's a 92,000 square foot building. It's small but we had to just bang our heads against the wall to sort of get this done in a way that was conducive to that sort of private sector thought process. It's being successful. FedEx just put some more money up. They're bringing in lots of great speakers and lots of research is going into it now and we're hopeful that this kind of thing will spin off and create. Let's tell them Mike, we sort of got a brain drain in Memphis. A lot of people go off to places like Stanford and then stay here or wherever because we're a second, third tier city so we're having to keep people there. We got involved in this and actually helped make it happen because we believe it's important. The title and I'm going to end the title that I put from my talk was created leadership partly because I couldn't think of anything in a short amount of time other than that. We're in the creative business and I knew this was about leadership but this is an example where we helped and a lot that you can do this in any venue where it's not just about the job. It's about where you live and what's going on and how does it fit into the bigger hole and what's good 10 years down the road and 20 years down the road. So there's civic leadership that comes out of this that I think all of you can play in the future and we promote that in our firm and have helped try to make a lot of projects happen and just go into extra mile to get things to happen. The ball parts, another one in downtown Memphis where that was a catalyst for lots of things that happened around there that just wouldn't have happened without a lot of people stepping up outside the boundaries of their business over into the civic realm and just making it happen. And then it pays back in lots of ways that you don't even know later on. Thank you. Wail on Web at Mrs. I'm just being, you said you're selling the LHP Apple, but the three of you, you know, two of you guys seem to have a bunch of experience at all. How do you convince companies to really think part of you and give you a project? Does it mean I imagine you to build a track for the success to get to the big part? And a second question, which is kind of a part of the, I just wondering when you felt the architecture might be able to do more of these, I'm sorry, say the last part? Yeah, just, you're able to do one of the door links of rebuilding. Do you plan on getting involved in that and using architecture to do a lot of stuff to rebuild that? Sure, okay. Should I try to summarize the question? Question generally is, how do you go about attracting clients in the early days of a firm when you're trying to compete and you don't necessarily have the full résumé as a firm to do so? And then the second part was the role that architects and architecture can play in New Orleans and the impact of Katrina along the Gulf Coast. The first one is, I'll just tell you what we did. We didn't even know really how to price what we did when we started the firm because the firms we worked for kept everything behind closed doors. So we just had to ask around and do the best we could. And I know we were lower than everybody else because our overhead was lower and that's all we needed. So that's the way a lot of entrepreneurs start their business. They're diving in low and they work hard and that's what we did. And then you have to sell yourself. And I think part of it had to do with our passion for what we do. And we had a decent, even though we were young and Richard was a little bit older, we had a decent track record in the community. People knew enough about us to take a chance on us. And we just had to go in and talk to them. And it was tough. Those first few years were tough. We actually got a lot of referrals from other architects. They were willing to, you know, things that they couldn't afford to do because they were too low. Price point was too low or they just didn't want to do it because it was a small job. They didn't think much of. And that helped us. Then we called on relationships that we had for contacts that we had from our previous employment. We didn't go attack our firm's clients, our previous firm's clients. But we just worked those communities, those networks in our business. And I think this is true in a lot of business. People hire higher people. It's a relationship driven, particularly in the service business. You got to be competent first. But then if they like you and they trust you and they know you'll stand behind your word, you'll get work. If you don't do any of those, they'll go somewhere else. So that's a big piece of it. And then on the Katrina question, New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. Actually, one of my partners is going down Friday to look at Baluxy. We were not involved in that first wave that, if you heard about the planners, all the new urbanists going down and planning that. We have all that information. We're in the loop. We'll probably be involved in the next wave. And there was a short fuse everybody had to show up. But we're some of our clients are going down and looking at it as well. So we'll be involved. And it is a great opportunity to set a new standard for building good places. Because we've done a good job at building a lot of really bad stuff. Yes. So first of all, are there any particular places on campus that you were particularly inspired from the architectural standpoint? And second question, do you frequently turn away from it? Because they have a different vision than you. Yes. Should I repeat? Okay. Tina asked if there are places on campus that I was particularly inspired by. And then the second part was, do we ever turn down clients? Because they don't have the same vision. On the first one, I don't know, I'd have to get the map out and walk around. So I don't know the names of the buildings. But certainly the church. Yeah. Memorial church. I mean, that's fantastic as an old building and as an architect. It's great to see those old buildings still there. The tower, the Hoover Tower as an icon is fantastic. And I like just the textures, the colors, the care that's obviously put into this place and taken care of is impressive. And then just some of the spaces, the quadrangle and some of the, I turn the corner near this tight little space and the landscaping is great. All of those different varied spaces make it appealing. We went and looked at the Clark Center, the new building. Really, if I just had a blank sheet of paper and no client, I would probably design modern work. But we do everything from extremely traditional to modern and we like it all. It's not about style. It's a good design. And I think the styles and the good design as it changes over time that represents history. And so it's what's great. What I see here is you can, you see that spectrum, you know, that evolution of the campus, which is, I think, is fantastic. And I like the new building. I was trying to think how would that work in other climates like Memphis. And you know, you guys can do things here with architecture and outdoor spaces that we can't do in other places of country. I can't do some of that in Memphis. I'm going to Detroit Friday night. Certainly can't do it up there. You know, it's just, so you have an advantage here to do some great architecture because of the climate that you live in. Second question was, oh yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Some clients want to do things that we consider inappropriate for current day. You know, design because we know it's not sustainable. You know, building more suburban models that have proven in places to not hold up over time. You know, the life cycle is very slow that we'll walk away from those. If the client won't pay us adequately so that we can pay our staff and our consultants. Obviously we can't do that. So we're pretty rigid about certain criteria. But at the same time, where some firms will say, and this is a much easier business model, I think for any business, if we only did office buildings, for example. It's much easier to get everybody on the team up to speed, top speed on doing office buildings. The production of our design process and delivery of documents is all much easier. What we do, and the reason we accept all those different project types, is we like that diversity. It keeps us motivated and stimulated. And it creates different disciplines. So we'll take or turn down projects based on that mix. You know, we like having, it's great to have a museum project going. We haven't done that many, but it's great to have one of those in the office. And it's great to have a single family house. And it's great to have this high rise modern condo going. It just creates a diversity of thought in the firm. And I think that some clients come to us and they see that and recognize it. And that's what they want. And those are the people we want to work for. There was a time when we started the firm, we said we can do anything for anyone. Because we were hungry and we needed to work. And we really thought we could. But we can't. Sometimes we're, so there are some things we're not qualified to do. We can't do everything. You can't be great at everything. We don't do cute care hospitals anymore. We did, but we really don't have the staff that has a passion for that. We don't do prisons. We don't do industrial facilities. There are things we don't do that sort of live work, play facilities and project types. We do those. And it's a composition that we try to put together. Who's first? Go. Go ahead. You mentioned that you were doing this new crisis scheme when you sort of get compensated based on the value that you have added to your clients. I just want to wonder how well received that was with some of the clients you maybe tested that out with. And also today's standup, which you've actually engaged in any international projects. I know that the actual style and some of the values of some of the clients maybe overseas might be different. And actually participate in that. Right. Okay, first question. You'll remind me of the second one. Now you got to do the first one again. You'll ask me with it. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. So the question is on the value added pricing compensation formula that we've worked up and we're still refining it. We have, I'll say moderate success. It's hard to take a client that we've been working with for 10 years and just be giving them fixed fees to do fixed practice now say, okay, we're going to we're going to work this way from now on. So obviously it's a little easier if we're particularly for exporting. We may be going into a new city. I mean, we're doing work from Toronto to South Florida, Colorado, mostly sort of the eastern 2 thirds of the US. It's a whole lot easier to if we get the phone call from someplace we've never been and they describe it and they say we want you guys doing this and we say, and we just say, here's how we work. We have base fees. We have success fees as well. Sometimes what we're doing is getting entitlements, you know, getting the zoning help well as soon as the entitlements are in place, the value of that property just went up tremendously. And we know we're pretty good at helping sell that effectively and do the right thing. So we oftentimes now we're putting it. We see base fees. We got to cover our cash flow and make money success fees for getting that value bumped up. And if they don't make it, they don't pass that. And then at the tail end when they develop the property, there's a there's a higher value there. And it's if it's a residential base, for example, it might be a few hundred dollars per unit. But if there's 2000 units, it's all those, you know, it's just, it's not huge, but it adds up and it makes a difference for us. Plus it changes the psychology of the marketplace. About us and about what we do. Now, you know, the interesting thing though, the hardest part right now is to get the staff in our firm to be able to say those words. You know, to be able to say, here's how we work and we have value added fees at the end because it's so different than we've ever done. And I don't know of any other architects doing it. I'm sure there are other architects that have different mechanisms for value added, but in that particular formula. And so they're uncomfortable asking for that kind of compensation. Generally designers are uncomfortable asking for money, periods. We would all work for free if we could because we just want to design, you know, back that statement. We just wanted, we just want to do what we do. And unfortunately we have to have money to eat and pay rent and all that stuff. Now you had a second part, what was that? Whether you work on an international project or consider it a work on any national projects. We, um, question is if we do international work and we. We have worked in Mexico, Puerto Rico, not international to Canada. We're working in. We have. We've been, we've had question or inquiries about a little bit in Europe and even China and New Zealand. These are just a few here and there, but we actually have zero interest because of lifestyle choice. There's no one. If someone, this is a great, here's our entrepreneurial spirit in our firm. If someone with the right talent showed up and said, I want to work for you guys and I want to open a market in Europe. I mean, I'd ask a lot of questions. It wouldn't be an easy decision, but we would consider the reason we're not doing it now is there's no one at a principal level in our firm that wants to be on a plane that much. So it's all, it's about being at home with your family and or whatever, you know, whatever your personal choices are about how you spend the time. You're not working and we work a lot and the one wants to do it. Obviously, if the market dried up here, we would do it, but we do what we have to do. But right now she's not an interest. Yes sir. It's in terms of building a sense of ownership and increasing value in your company that you're all kind of stuck to the designers of the architects working with your firm. I'm curious about how that has kind of played out with regards to the value of that stock. They can solve that kind of thing and what that stock makes to me is then other than having ownership of the company and how the firm actually relates to the greater values of the world in general, how perhaps we interpretation another sustainable design issues have played into LRK. The first question has to do with just how we value stock and what that means to people that own stock. Before we did the ESOP, which means you know everybody participates, employee stock ownership plan is what that means and everybody when you set that up everybody participates, it's not that's the way the laws are written. So we put in essence the firm puts money into everyone's account so to speak in terms of owning stock and that's it's formula driven and so you know if we the better we do each year than the more we're able to buy stock on behalf of everyone if that makes any sense. And so if you leave there's a vesting period and again this higher consultants to help do this but in general terms if you if you there's a vesting period so say it's five years I think that's what it is if you stay there if you're with us for the full five years when you leave you take the value of that stock with you if you leave after one year. I think maybe you get 10% of it or something like that so part of it's to encourage people to stay and build value in the firm that way that's the ESOP. The original stock ownership transfer had to do with it was about leadership and being an entrepreneur internal entrepreneur and all those things and driving and so people that really made a difference got a stock off now that might have been 10 shares at one time might be 50 but we went from three founding partners at home a third each to Carson and now own less than 25% and the balance is owned by the rest of staff their loans about 8% the value of the stock has gone up tremendously we did have a dip the recession that was one of the tough times that we could talk about the recession 9-11 hit us really hard and we went from 160 to 110 people in about a year. That was the dark days we called that was tough and and the stock did the same just like I mean it works it's a valuation formula and it works just like any other stock I mean you have different valuation formulas but it has to do with you know retained earnings and book value and then as we grew and became more profitable and new we were going to make it we actually there's a slight increase in the value or just book value and then that gets you know it's a per share basis. This year for example the stock is going up about 45% so it's not bad it's been it's been a really good investment for people that that bought in and they see it and so when they leave they take it with them we can't we pay them out and we have the ability to pay them out over time you had one other piece that I think the short answer. Oh yeah it leads yeah are we doing things on sustainable design we we have several people lead certified we're actually participating in the review and writing of the leads manual on neighborhood design because we're doing so much with the planning we feel like well that's where we should focus let's get the plan right and then we can focus on the buildings so we're we're very much involved in hope but we want to accelerate that and actually do more. Before doing the dinner apple I'd like on behalf of bases and STB I'd like to thank thanks for joining us today.
