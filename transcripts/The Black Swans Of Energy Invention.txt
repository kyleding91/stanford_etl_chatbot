 You were listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at edcorner.stanford.edu. So let me say a couple of words about Vinod, although this might be one speaker I don't even have to say anything about. How many of you have ever heard of Vinod Kosole before? Okay, that sort of settles it. For the Elon television, everybody raised their hand. And so you have the bio, and of course those watching have the bio online, but a couple of things I'd like to point out, he did grow up in India. This is a global sort of afternoon, so we're celebrating that. But he came to the United States and went to Carnegie Mellon and eventually here at Stanford University. He started son, was a member of Kleiner Perkins, but now has his own venture firm with he and his partners, they call it Kosole Ventures. It's interesting that on this very stage, less than 24 hours ago, if you saw the daily today, it's a candidate's energy policies debated. There was a hot debate in here, maybe some of you were here. So this topic is, there it goes. This topic is not only important to those of us who care about entrepreneurship, but it's obviously important to people who care about policy and all sorts of things. And it's evidenced by the turnout today. So without further ado, let's welcome Vinocos Lop. Thanks. Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good, we got everybody engaged. Okay. I didn't know what to talk about. So I decided to talk about a wide number of things. Go through a lot of different topics. And give you a smattering in a field for how I think about both entrepreneurship, which is about half of you and renewable energy, which hopefully the other half of you or all of you are interested in. I start with a philosophy. You can't be reasonable and do unreasonable times. In most change, people believe is unreasonable. So people assume things will be the way they are. And I'll come back to this. This is one of my favorite things. It's also true that anything out of the ordinary that you tell people you want to do, and I'll give you some examples. People immediately say it's not possible. If you're in a big company, no matter how innovative, you almost don't want to say it because if you succeed, okay, but if you fail, you're fired, that's not an even trade. But my personal view is try and fail, but don't fail to try. It's the single most important lesson I can give all of you here today, no matter what you're doing. And there's lots of great things on there, but I won't take the time to go through it. I want to give you some examples of how ridiculous people can be in retrospect. I'll come back to this issue of retrospective viewing. I thought that the wireless music box, of course, was the radio. That there was no practical use for it. This was when messages were sent through teletax and other ways to people in particular, not to people in general. In fact, Henry Warner, I can't even imagine why you would say that, but he's one of the most modern and more innovative guys. I mean, I can go on. This was fairly recent, 1977 deck, one of our competitors at Sun. No wonder they're not around anymore. This was the head of the President of the Royal Society. In fact, I want to tell you that almost anything you can imagine you can do. You just have to try hard enough. So let me move on to renewable energy and talk about what's important. Most of what you've heard about renewable energy, I find relatively uninteresting, wrong, immaterial, hybrids are the important, not really. Wind is an important, not really. Is solar, photovoltaics important, not really? Maybe I'll try and explain to you why. Because these three things, what matter? When people talk about photovoltaics, when they say, well, it can grow 30% a year for 10, 15, 20 years, become 5% of worldwide in electricity. I believe that. What about the other 95? It's relevant scale that matters. And none of these technologies can get to relevant scale till they're at relevant cost. And there's only one relevant cost. And that's cheaper than their fossil competitors. Nothing else matters, nothing else scales, nothing else solved the climate change problem. And adoption is important and maybe I'll come back and talk about this. So I call this the Chindia test. If a technology doesn't meet the Chindia price, the price at which it will be adopted in India and China. And remember, there's no subsidies for any of this stuff in most of the world. They have to be cheaper than coal or cheaper than oil. Otherwise, it doesn't work. You also can't brute force this technologies. They have to grow up in an exponential distributed fashion the way they're internet did. That's a great model of how these things scale. And I'm going through this very quickly because there's lots of different things I want to cover. And finally, adoption risk matters. There's some things consumer. There's lots of great technologies that were never adopted. Hydrogen is an example of things we keep hearing about that I don't think will ever be adopted not in the next 20 years. So whether it's by the financial community, by the consumer, or the market, adoption's important. So what becomes important to something that works, that actually solves the climate change problem, it has to have a cost. I actually didn't know I had this slide in this deck, so somebody changed my deck on me. Cost, carbon reduction, and carbon scaling trajectory. What do I mean by that? Teeboon pickens recently proposed we switch to natural gas. You can get an immediate reduction of 20% in carbon emissions per mile driven. But then it's a dead end. How do you go from 20% to 40% to 60% to 80%. We switch our infrastructure to natural gas, which is much cleaner. But then we are in the dead end. The trajectory is absolutely key. Means it should not only get my mic isn't working. So somebody in audio video, I'll try and speak loudly. And maybe somebody else can help with that. Is the broadcast going okay? Somebody tell me? Okay. So I'll speak loudly here. So maybe that mic is locked here. No? Yeah. So just a minute. Okay. Well, that means I have to stand here. So maybe you can point out that. Okay. Projectory is important. You can't pick things in many people in the environment, community, are picking solutions that get to 10% or 20%. Now we all hear efficiencies important and efficiencies important. But it isn't the big factor that solves our problem because we can save 10% or 20% of our energy or 50%. We need 10 times more energy if 9 billion people on this planet by 2050 are going to live at the steam standard of living that we are used to. And nothing else is relevant. So what is relevant? There's only two or three things that matter. This is not a complex question. You know, I love to hear Cheryl Crow talk about use only one sheet of toilet paper. Sorry, you can all switch to one sheet of toilet paper. It's not going to make a difference to climate change. There's all these books about David Bach wrote a book about it. The 100 things you can do to help the environment. 99 of the 100 make no difference at all. So we got to separate what really matters, what's material from what really is just feel good stuff. And there's a lot of feel good environmentalism that actually gets in the way of tackling real problems. We need to replace oil. Oil and coal between them are 65% to 70% of total global emissions. If we solve that problem, replace coal, replace oil, we're done. Materials are important. And steel are the next biggest emitters of carbon dioxide. If we make those four things low carbon, we will have solved the carbon problem. If we don't solve those four problems, no matter what else we do, how many rolls of toilet paper we say, we're not going to solve the problem. So we should focus on the real issue. Of course, it's important only in that it reduces the need for oil and coal and helps us replace it. But let's keep that in mind. So face the facts, how many people own a Prius here? Few hands. Cost you about $5,000 extra to buy a Prius. You can save much more and it saves you about one ton of carbon per year. You can save 10 tons of carbon by just painting a 10 by 10 foot or a small area of your roof white. You'll save more carbon than by buying a Prius. I wrote a blog called Prius More Green Wash Than Green. Now that it's a bad car, I own a hybrid. I drive a hybrid. Everybody in our family drives a hybrid. But it's not a solution. Because it doesn't scale, it doesn't the right cost and it doesn't save enough carbon. It saves about a ton a year. Wind and photovolve takes. How about saying to somebody, will ship you power when the wind's blowing or the sun shining? Rest at the time. Forget your homework, if you're in your dorm or forget your favorite NFL game or TV show. That's the problem with wind and photovoltaics. That has not to say it's hopeless. But if you're going to have wind and photovoltaics scale, we need to have storage of electricity. So the thing to work on to enable wind and photovoltaics is to work on storage of electricity not on wind and photovoltaics. It's important to understand what makes things possible. The big thing the world is counting on is CCS, carbon capture and storage. Take the carbon dioxide, separate it from the air and then pipe it under high pressure underground. Sorry, this doesn't work. It works. It costs so much. Nobody's going to use it. And if that's our only solution, we are toast. So let me go to the more hopeful part of this. Most people in this world take past history and they build sophisticated models and extrapolate and predict the past and predict the future. I like to say, and I first came up with this, I spoke at the UN right after the head of the International Energy Administration and the head of McKinsey Global Institute. They made all these forecasts and models and I said, when I came up, I said, everything you heard just now is entirely wrong. And it was wrong because it was based on a set of assumptions on the past. They had no way to include in their future forecasts what technology would do. Alan Kay, who was a computer scientist at Applewood one time, very famous around here and at Zerox Park, said, the best way to predict the future is to invent it. And I firmly believe it's the only way to predict the future. So there's different classes of people. People say people like Exxon. Exxon was said 99% of the world will be dependent on oil and I'm only going to worry about that 99% let everybody else worry about the 1%. Then there's the environmentalists, many of my friends who want to do everything. And that's wrong too because it's race resources and we don't have infinite resources. So when people say, well, let's put solar panels in same Francisco, I said, that's a bad idea, it's a foggy city. You know, let's not do everything, let's do the cost effective stuff. And then I like to say I'm a pragmentalist. I want to do, I share the same goals as the environmentalists in where we want to get to, but we need to be pragmatic to be realistic. This is my great hope and I'll give you some examples of this. People really experience the art of the possible. In 1996, I told some senior executives in the telephone companies that long distance calls would be free. For 18p that was 80% of their revenue and I said, you know, 10 years, this will all be free. People said that's unimaginable. It's unimaginable that a top 4, 2, and 10 company would go under. 10 years later, they were sold for a song because long distance calls are free. How many of you care whether you're calling in area or out of the area? That wasn't the case 10 years ago. The world can change. All because technology expands the art of the possible. And this art of the possible and this is why entrepreneurship is so important. It's the power of ideas driven by entrepreneurial energy. It's the only thing we need. My general approach, this is my view to solving any problem, almost anything. Take a big problem, add the best minds, add the power of ideas, the fuel of entrepreneurial energy and a touch of capitalist greed. All those are essential components to solving problems. And people often ask me how I got into this environmental movement. And I've worried about the environment for a long time. And in the 90s, I started taking my kids to the Amazon rainforest and diving in Palau into those looking at rail sharks and things like that. And I worked closely, I did trips with the Nature Conservancy and Conservation International and all these groups. And I realized that they were all really well-intentioned, all doing important things in terms of preserving the forests, of preserving the corals. But nothing they were doing was going to change the course of industry. And that was the root problem. They were working on the fringes trying to save some corals. It's a really important, I love diving. But it wasn't going to solve the problem by worrying about the corals. We had to worry about our energy infrastructure. We had to worry about material things. So some unconventional thing, most people believe oil is not replaceable. It is not only easily replaceable, we won't even debate this 10 years from now. And we will replace it with something that's a lot cheaper than oil, so everybody will use it. Same thing with coal, and I'll talk about some clever ideas. There was a great book. How many people have heard the book Black Swan? Oh, good. Mostly only two or three hands go up. I believe there are positive Black Swan's, negative Black Swan's. The word came from the fact that everybody in the Western world believed swans were white, because there are no white, anything other than white blacks swans in the Western world till people went to Australia, saw a Black Swan, and that one thing changed their view of what a swan is. Their extreme impact events, their rare events, and most importantly, their retrospectively predictable. It's easy to explain today why long distance calls should be free. It's easy to explain today why we got into this debt crisis, all this bad debt. A month ago, nobody could explain it. Nobody even believed it was possible. That's a negative Black Swan. I believe we have plenty of technology Black swans on the positive side. And what we need is more actbacks, more shots and gold, because you can predict which of these things will come true. And if more of you go work on these problems, most of you may fail, but the few who succeed will save the world. And that's what we need. So what are Black swans? People don't like cold. So what if more cold plants meant cleaning up the air, cleaner air? Hard to imagine. What people say driving causes a lot of emissions. What if driving more reduced the carbon on this planet? I won't go through all of that. But I will tell you we're working on all of those, ridiculous as they sound. So let me talk quickly about energy and how I view this. This is what people think of clean tech or renewable energy. I actually think it's sort of irrelevant to the equation. I hope I've given you a sense of that. The new green is about not about clean tech, but it's about main tech. It's about the infrastructure of society. Because unless we change every part of our daily life, we are not going to get to the level of carbon reduction this planet needs. And that's 80% reduction. It's about engines, enlightening, appliances, batteries, gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. It's about everything we do. Now some people think that's a problem. I think it's an opportunity. Because without a big problem, nobody pays you to solve it. You can't get paid for solving a problem that doesn't exist. So this clean tech stuff is the fringe. It's 5, 10, 20% of certain markets. I think we need to solve the 80%. And that's where the big opportunity comes from. So I'm going to give you a very quick sense of how we look at these four areas and what our portfolio looks like and walk you through some examples of blacks ones. To replace coal, you can do all this. And I won't go through all this. I want to get to a few areas. Efficiency is important, both electrical and mechanical. That's lighting in batteries and motors. Engine homes, engines, appliances, oil. And all this is on my website at CoastLoventures.com. So you don't have to. And there's lots of papers there if you want to read about them. But just about everything we do in our daily lives. And we have lots of companies who walk you through some examples of how they're changing our lives. So instead of looking through the portfolio, I'll walk you through how I view the world. This is one of my favorites. Calera is building a new cement. What if cement instead of being carbon positive, emitting lots of carbon dioxide was carbon negative, actually absorbed carbon dioxide? Then every time you build something, you sequester carbon. And this company came up with a great idea. Cold plants cement lots of carbon and so do oil plants and all kinds of industrial processes. All kinds of nasty stuff coming out of some stacks. They sort of, boy, that isn't very clear. They came up, and this is a Stainford professor. They came up very clever chemistry to take this nasty stuff and turn it into cement. So he takes all the nasty stuff coming out of coal, carbon dioxide, sulfur, socks, knots, even mercury, puts them into a cement as carbonates. In those of you who know little chemistry, carbon dioxide can go into carbonates. I can go into more detail if we have time for questions. So cement could completely change our view of the world. In fact, it's the only way I see solving the carbon sequestration problem among the stuff that's visible to me today. Traditional approaches to carbon sequestration will not work. Living homes said, we build our homes this way. How about building them prefab? Now, most people think of prefab as ugly. Well, they don't have to be. This home costs the same as a regular home. Is prefab in its first leads platinum home in the United States? Doesn't cost anymore because it's built in a factory and prefab. It can be a lot more effective. Solar Dime is doing class that can switch colors. Go from dark to light so you can save energy or allow more heat into your house. Electrochromic glass. Now, I'll find to stay non-technical. These are all the companies we have that are doing fuels of one sort or another for your car. But I want to give you one example of a black one that's sort of my favorite. Most oil comes from oil wells goes into, as crude oil into refineries and then into your gas pump. This company said, what if you could take biomass and turn it into crude oil? Then we wouldn't have to worry about any adaption risk. Remember I said that? Okay. Now, you have biomass. We know that over millions of years you can convert into crude oil. That's how all the crude oil on this plant comes from. Well, they said, well, what if instead of taking millions of years we took a few minutes? I won't go into the details, but that's what they're working on. And they think they're pretty close. That's a black swan. And this is pure chemistry. This clever chemistry, clever catalysis. With companies working on electrical efficiency and mechanical efficiency, eco-modeers doing better engines for your cars, how many people in mechanical engineering here? Quite a few hands. So I'll maybe do an example. Transonic is an interesting company. Most people think there's only two types of engines. Spark ignition engines where you have a spark plug that ignites the fuel. And auto ignition. Well, this company invented a third type. People still say it's not possible, but they think that they can double the efficiency of an engine. It's clever. They do a new fuel injector and the ignition happens. Pre-ignition happens in the fuel injector. I won't go into the technical details, but something that everybody thought was impossible that there were only two types of engines because we'd only seen two types for last 100 years. We invented a different type. Now one little breakthrough like that, if you can double the efficiency of engines, cuts worldwide oil consumption in half and completely changes the politics of the whole planet. It changes every assumption we have about how the world needs to work. Sorry. Topanga is working on outdoor lighting. Medium lighting, street lighting, different kind of lighting. These companies are generating electricity. Clean electricity and I gave you one example, Calera, that's trying to make cold cleaner. These are companies that are trying to do 100% renewable electricity. Makepoint energy is trying to produce clean natural gas because natural gas is a fossil fuel. These companies are trying to do LED lighting. This is a classic example. They think they can be 10 times more efficient than the regular incandescent lamp, maybe 20 times. What does that do to electricity consumption and how much we need? All those traditional models that the International Energy Administration and others want to talk about. To be fair to the International Energy Administration, after I gave my talk on why everything they told you was wrong, the director came up to me and said he really appreciated my reasons for it, invited me to talk to their board about my views. They gave him credit. NanoH2Os doing water desalination, water is probably as big a problem as oil. Kai is doing lasers for your TVs, do a whole new kind of TV. Sigeris is doing all sorts of chemicals and bioplastics. And the other approach is very simple. This is old Egyptian language, letters made into syllables and words into poems. That we can do the same thing starting with some platform chemistries. We can create a whole family of bioplastics. And so they're sort of doing all kinds of things and they're not talking about what they're doing so I'm being a little bit way. Gratz said nylon is a big product. All the carpet here is nylon. We can just make a renewable nylon that's made from copper lactin. It's renewable nylon, backs doing better air conditioners, huge sorts of lactin. So I hope I've given you a sense how almost everything we do can and probably will be changed. People say well it hasn't happened. I have to tell you that three, four years ago nobody was working on the problem. How many PhD candidates here? Three, a few hands. So in 2004 I asked the director of engineering at the dean of the engineering school at UC Berkeley. How many of your professors interested in energy? He did an informal survey and the answer was close to zero. That's why we don't have solution. It was the last area in the world a smart PhD student would go into. He informally did the same survey in 2006 before he passed away unfortunately because of cancer. In 50% of the professors in the engineering school were interested in energy and I recently asked the president of MIT and she said energy is now the first choice for all their bright new graduate students to do a PhD. That's the crux of solving the problem. Remember I said it's the power of ideas. The ideas come from the smartest people and the smartest people have not been going into energy for 30 or 40 years maybe longer. And that's why I'm so optimistic that five years now when we have all these new PhDs in bright new minds we will solve the problem. The other side of this people sort of say hey what about stock bubbles and all this. I want to give you an important message. This was the dot com bubble in 2000. This is what Morgan Stanley high technology index. But again I want to tell you stock prices and bubbles are irrelevant. Why do I say they were irrelevant in the dot com world? Because what's not stock prices in Wall Street are this artificial thing people trade on. They're not important. Please stop paying attention to them. Here's what what happened. Oh this is dark. You see this line which is hard to see. That's internet traffic. That was the actual usage I was wondering where that line disappeared. That's the actual usage of the internet. There was no bubble. It didn't slow down. Why does this sort of fluctuation in stock prices matter? What really matters of what people are doing day to day? And that's internet traffic. It never slowed down. There was no bubble. Stock price bubbles happened the whole time. The first one happened in 1930s. When you could get permission to build a railroad between two cities in England you could offer scripts on the market or modern day equivalent of going public. And of course there was a stock price bubble. You see that right there. And then stock prices collapsed. But through this period rail building didn't stop. And we didn't stop using railways. We saw bubbles and broadcasting. We saw them in the internet. We'll see it in every area. What's important is that we look at the reality behind it, not at artificial things like stock prices. That's why personally I never pay attention to stock prices. If you do the right thing, build the right business, something that people want to use. The rest will take care of itself. I'm going to take a few more minutes to talk about innovation. I have some recommended reading. For those of you who want to change the world with positive black swans, I highly recommend this book even though it's hard to read. To think differently, this is a fun read, the purple cow. And for those of you who want to apply the same entrepreneurial energy to social causes, how to change the world is about social entrepreneurship. A wonderful book, lots of great stories. And entirely in the nonprofit world, one of my personal heroes is banker to the poor. And this is a great example. I first visited Professor Eunice in Bangladesh. I think it was in the late 90s. And looked at the model. And then we funded this small operation in India that I thought would be a great nonprofit. This little nonprofit has now grown to the point where it is adding 300,000 new families a month to their, it's a microfinance organization, to their base. That's what they added in September with all the credit crisis. 300,000 families, that's about a million and a half people a month. They're profitable, making money and expanding their reach. They'll recently, they were adding 60 new bank branches or village branches a month. And they were applying every good personnel training technique at a McDonald's in Starbucks in making sure their loan officers could scale that rapidly. So no matter which area you're looking at, entrepreneurship in the power of ideas works. I sort of want to take five minutes before I open it up to questions on the subject of innovation and how innovation works. I'm going to take you through the world of biofuels. And talk about eight or nine companies that we deal with in how, this is not about the specific companies, but how people build on each other's ideas. This is an essential component of making progress. So Mescoma as a company started by Professor Lee Land at Dartmouth. He'd been working on say, Losec Athena or technologies for 15, 20 years. They take all kinds of waste, paper mill waste, converted, fermented into, into, into Athena. And that's the traditional way to produce say, Losec Athena. This company came along and said, well, they're doing it wrong. Say, Losec material, right starting place. But I don't want to pick a particular say Losec material and build an enzyme to work on that, then convert it into Athena or just gasify it. And their justification was when Hitler ran out of oil during the Second World War, he gasified coal and converted into diesel. We can do the same thing with biomass. This is a plant they built and they're building this plant. Well, this next company came along and so what they, let me give you one more detail. What they do is convert the biomass gasified into something called sin gas, which is 50% carbon monoxide and 50% hydrogen. Then they use a catalyst to convert it into Athena. This company came along and said, well, range got that part right that we should gasify all this biomass wood chips in this case. But they got the back end right. They shouldn't use the chemical catalyst. Chemistry is all wrong. We'll use bugs. We'll ferment the sin gas. They built on top of range's idea. They did that. Well, then this little company came along from New Zealand and they said, people are right that you should sort of use sin gas. But half of sin gas carbon monoxide, there are lots of places. They start working at a steel mill and said, we'll design bugs that generate their own hydrogen so we don't need sin gas. We'll just take carbon monoxide. And so they designed a new bug. This is all simple genetic engineering that actually through the pyrovate pathway generates its own makeup hydrogen. If it has hydrogen that uses it, if it's not there, it makes it. And so they produce ethanol and butaneol. Of course, if you have biomass, you make sin gas. Their bugs use it. If they don't, if you have steel mill gas, they'll use steel mill waste gases to convert it. See this notion of building on top of each other. This is not one of my favorite examples came out of Berkeley. This company, Amriss, had a $42 million grant from the Gates Foundation. So in Africa, need malaria resistant drugs. Automation is the drug that's sort of the best drug for this. Very expensive, produced in microgram quantities from plant in China. Bad way to make a drug. So if a person is visiting Africa, they can afford it. But nobody in Africa can afford automation. So they took the genes from this plant and put it into a bug. Now, to make an anti-malarial drug this way. Now, we came along and said, what about, you sort of built a chemical factory inside this? How about a different set of genes? And can you produce diesel the same way you produce automation? Took them less than six months of genetic engineering and sort of some fancy synthetic biology work. And that's what they're doing now. LS9 looked at what they were doing, sort of went further. All these pretty pictures. Each of these is a metabolic pathway inside a cell. For those of you who don't know, say, a machinery goes on inside every cell or most cells in our body. They're focused in on the particular pathway. It looks just like an integrated circuit for those of your electrical engineers. To me, it's all the same. They're the same model. They sort of looked at that part of the circuit, optimized it. And then they cut off all the other things the cell does, all the other stuff. So all the energy is channeled into producing the thing they want to produce. Happens to be in biology, but it could be an electrical circuit too. Or a mechanical circuit for that matter. I won't go through all this, given you this example. I want to leave time for questions. I think that's the last thing I want to talk about. I've talked about this. That hopefully gives you a sense of how entrepreneurial ideas build on each other. People find out do each other. Take the best of their ideas. And let me stop there and open it up to questions. And if there's questions, I've said some controversial things. I'll try and answer them. People don't like me saying maybe pre-assisting the right solution. It's a good solution. I drive one. The cost-effective is never going to be a big part of the next billion cars we ship on this planet. So questions come up to maybe the mics and feel free to ask me anything. So I've got a question about cost-effectiveness in particular. It seems that a lot of these renewable or cleaner alternatives are competing with what are essentially commodity goods, whether that's oil or nylon or materials. How can we forge profitable companies while competing with basement prices on so many of these? Well, they're not basement prices. They're the prices that are the prices. In most of these cases, people haven't developed technologies to compete with them because they didn't think it was possible. They failed to try. They didn't fail trying. That's why I started there. It is very, very clear. I gave you the example of KioR which is trying to turn biomass into crude oil. They think they'll be at $25 a barrel. I don't know how oil competes with them. Same thing with coal. If I take an old coal power plant and turn its exhaust into cement, I produce cheaper coal power and cheaper cement. Those industries would be history without this new technology. It is entirely possible. Grats producing copper lacta in nylon six or nylon six six. They're doing it cheaper than oil-based copper lacta. Yes? I have actually short two questions. One last thought. I mean, I urge all of you. Look at conventional wisdom limit you're thinking. The biggest problem is what people think is possible, not what's possible. So I really, you know, I see this all the time. People say it's not possible. In fact, I like to make some outrageous statements because once in a while somebody will come up and say, you said that can't be done. I know how to do it. That's the best answer. Sorry. I love the line of the same question. What are the, I mean, you said the energy is being developed right now. Could be cheaper than oil and could be possibly used in many different industries. They could be their competitive advantage. Right now, it seems like a lot of small companies, especially companies that we haven't heard of. What they're doing, they can't really spread their good stuff with that government help or because, so my question is, will government need to intervene in this environmental crisis or can it be done purely just by companies and entrepreneurs? In some sense, the government has intervened and said, we're not going to charge you for carbon emissions. You know, a hundred years ago, we didn't charge people for dumping wastewater into the river or dumping garbage in the garbage dump. We had all kinds of waste that we didn't charge for when we ran into limits. We started charging for it. If we charge for carbon and said, here's the maximum amount of carbon, we wouldn't have this issue. So in fact, the lack of action, the lack of, you know, we have the tragedy of the comments. You dump, those are few economic students. You allow people to dump stuff in the air, they will because it lowers their cost. You charge them for that dumping to the fair value of removing that dumped material. Of course, that their comparative advantage will disappear. So coal-based power is not comparative with a different kind of solar power, solar thermal power. And tomorrow morning, we'll be opening a pilot plant in Bakersfield early morning in Governor Schwarzenegger's going to sort of announce this tomorrow morning. It's because carbon has been priced at coal as cheaper. Coal would be more expensive than solar thermal power if that wasn't the case. So we do need policy. We need, so policy is going to be very, very important. Without policy, this is not going to work. Fortunately, both Arcane Ditch for President are very inclined to limit carbon. So I think we'll solve the problem. I don't believe we need lots of subsidies and things. It can help accelerate the programs, but I don't believe they are essential. And more importantly, I don't believe they should last very long. For example, I believe the wind subsidy has lasted a long time and we should discontinue it. It's too expensive today. And we could use that money for research and universities and use it better. Yes. It's actually kind of a follow-up question what you're talking about. How do you see the future of carbon emission trading working, particularly in the US? That's a very general question. I think it's hard to predict today. By December of next year, there's a large meeting in Copenhagen by which time we should have a successor to the Kyoto Treaty. So that answer is probably a year away from now. If we don't come to agreement in Copenhagen next December, then we will have a major crisis. Then each person will be left to fend on their own. Half of Florida could be underwater. I don't have those charts here. It's sort of fun to say. The World Trade Center, we wouldn't have to worry because it'd be underwater. And so I'm hopeful, and most people are hopeful, we will come to a treaty, and that will then define the nature of the carbon cap and trade regime. Are emissions trading as being pretty crucial to work with all these technologies? Yes. Thank you. Yes. Hi. First, I apologize for my voice. I'm getting over a cold. So I'm sorry, but I sound so awful. You've shared with us some things that we do in our normal lives that are really kind of a waste of time. I'm wondering how your views are on recycling. Is that something that's worth our time and effort or not really? So the question is recycling what the effort. I do believe it is, in general, but you can't say that 100% of the time. There are plenty of examples of recycling that take more energy than it would just dump the material. So again, don't accept conventional wisdom blindly. And that's sort of hopefully you got that. You know, I'm not saying a Prius doesn't reduce carbon, but it is a relatively ineffective way to reduce carbon. In fact, let me see if they shut that off. Okay. Oh, maybe they didn't. So McKinsey did this study and they said of all these different technologies in the details don't matter. What is the cost to reduce a ton of carbon? Hybridization of cars was right here. The most expensive technology. Yet it's so fashionable with environmentalists. Why? And by the way, if I go back to what's the actual carbon reduction for mild driven with various technologies? The numbers don't look very good. I won't go through these details. The papers and details are on my website. But they don't look very good for what is likely to be the US electric grade or the India electric grade or the China electric grade. So analysis is important and cost is important. Instead of spending $5,000 in a Prius to reduce a ton of carbon dioxide, you could spend two or three hundred dollars on changing the lamps in your house and save as much carbon. Lamps are lighting is somewhere in here if you use CFL lamps. It actually saves you money. Anything below the line saves you money. Anything above the line costs you money. You can't say efficiency is cost effective or not depends on for what. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. My question isn't so much on energy. It's more on the process of innovation. Just now you're mentioning that one of the generic solutions you had was to bring together the best minds. I'm wondering if you are a startup and not an established company like Sun Microsystems. How do you bring the best people together and once you do, how do you keep them engaged so that they can build on each other's ideas? You know, today it may be an established company in 1982, it was 425 year olds. What did you do? You believed in your vision, you had a religious belief and this is key of entrepreneurship. Every time, in this and why people who get into entrepreneurship, you make money, generally are not as successful as the people who get into entrepreneurship because they believe in their mission. It's the missionaries, not the mercenaries who are really successful. That's why I say ignore stock prices. If you believe in what you're doing, you'll sell your heart out. You'll convince people to join you. You can use to all kinds of people to join us from sheer sort of global advantage, if I might call it that. It was really religious belief. What happens in this kind of an environment? So let's start a ridiculous idea like replacing IBM and DEC in the computer business. People thought that was crazy. When you run into a problem and there is no entrepreneurial effort that doesn't run into problems. If you're interested in making money, you say, boy, this is hard. Let me go do something else. If you believe in your mission, it doesn't matter if it's a rock wall. You just bang your head against it till you get past it. And that's the key to entrepreneurship. It's sort of keep banging at it till you succeed and nothing gets in your way. And that's an essential quality. Yes. Thanks. So I'm actually from New Zealand. But I've never heard of the company lands a take. And so my question is really a case of, do the small startup companies doing innovative, exciting stuff need to become as big as some of the larger, for example, oil companies or energy companies as they like to call themselves now in order to have the economies of scale to really make a big positive impact on the world? Or can there just be a thousand little garage efforts which then together sort of lead to success? Then really, unless you're big, you don't have impact. And having global impact means you're big in some way. You don't have to become a big company. You could invent your technology and license it out. But by and large, you know, and this is something people don't understand. Unless it pervades everything. Which means necessarily that you're a big business. You really not having impact. There's no point solving 10% of the problem, especially a big problem like climate change. If you're addressing 90% of the problem, then you're going to be a big company. And you may not heard of lands attack, but I like to say lands attack is not a zero million dollar company because they have no revenue. But they are a zero billion dollar company. And the difference is they're attitude. The difference between zero million and zero billion is all in the attitude. How you think of yourself, what kind of people you hire, how you portray yourself, and how you build your own goals. So yes, you have to be big. Hi. What about the transition? I mean, economical transition. For instance, in the 1930s, the US had this great depression. However, now we're facing a global AI economy that is basically a very big portion of it. It's based on oil products and it's derivatives. How do you think we're going to be able to survive this transition between regular oil and now this new oil? The world doesn't work from the top down. This is what economists do. I sort of, another version of my slide deck is, you know, don't believe the economists in the econometrics. It's top down views. The world works from the bottom up. One car at a time switching to something else. There are disruptions. How did 183, how did we go to free phone calls when everybody in the world relied on most of their revenue coming from long distance? It happened. There was force to change. They adapted. Some did. Some did. They failed. That same thing will happen here. You know, somebody will build a plant in Alabama. Somebody in Georgia will build three of those. And then they'll be copied in California and Washington and Beijing and everywhere else. That's how the world works. So I don't believe those sort of top down models. You know, you get all these statements by the pundits about how many trillions of dollars of energy infrastructure we have. That's all nonsense. It doesn't need to be. In the end, they'll count it back up in 2050 and say, yes, we spent trillions. But it will have had, happened, ten million dollars at a time. Each little decision, this is what I called about scaling in an exponential distributed way. Lots of different. It's like vacuum oil. And if Exxon's trying to kill him, they'll be backing molds all day long. And you one will keep popping up because better technology exists. So you've alluded to the importance of energy storage in your presentation. And I think anybody who wants to actually get off oil is acknowledged that. But your portfolio of companies, or at least what you publish online, actually has relatively few energy storage companies, is this because you're having difficulty actually finding startups that you think are, you know, meritorious in terms of funding or? Yes. Energy storage is a massive problem. There's not enough effort. I gave the hotel lecture, which is a name lecture at the MIT Chemical Engineering Department about three weeks ago. And I asked people, let me ask the question here. How many people have heard of flow cells? A few hands. More than when up at MIT, so that's good. Most people haven't even heard the term. I suspect energy storage for wind will probably be a flow cell. I could be something different. I'd like to be surprised with something better. But nobody's working on it. I don't know one serious research effort on flow cells that sort of has 50 researchers working on it. It's big enough problem where we share. I know it's 5.30. Those of you who need to leave all take a few more minutes and take questions, but those are few. That's a great idea. And so he's agreed to do bonus time, which is pretty cool, but can we do a grapple for the bonus? Sure. And then we'll continue. So let me introduce the speakers to students. So on behalf of the base of the S.E.V.P., thank you for coming. Oh, thank you.
