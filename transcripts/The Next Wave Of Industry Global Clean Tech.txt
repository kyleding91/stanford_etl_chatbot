 You were listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at edcorner.stanford.edu. So it's a real pleasure to get underway now with our guest today. Eric Strasser is a partner at more at more David Al Ventures and he leads, he created their Clean Tech practice and he leads that practice for them. In addition to his work there, he's actually been an advocate or an evangelist for Clean Tech investing across Silicon Valley and in the venture community in general. So it's a real pleasure. It's a very timely set of issues around Clean Tech investing. I don't know how many saw the New York Times magazine piece this weekend covering a lot of what's going on in this space is being very exciting. A whole new sector of the economy that's opening up. Eric is actually an alum of Stanford. Thankfully he earned his PhD at Stanford as well as his masters. Did his undergraduate at Harvey Mudd College but probably more important than anything else he was one of the founding principles behind the Entrepreneurial Thought Leadership series back in the day. We won't talk about years but he helped found this effort and it's a pleasure really almost like coming home for you isn't it to be here today. So let's dive right in and see what he has to say for himself but please help me welcome Eric to ETL. Thank you. So maybe we could just start at a high level and maybe you could tell the students about your work in Clean Tech investing. Sure. I've been at Mord Avedao a little over 10 years now. Some days it feels like forever especially in today's environment sometimes. Back in 2002 in the kind of lower days of the decline of the tech boom. I started thinking about what was going to be the next area in which technology could really shape a new set of industries. And what I started to look and come across time and time again was that there was a transition that was about to happen and the transition was probably going to be the most profound in my lifetime. And the transition very simply is the next 40 percent of people on this planet are going to achieve an American or American middle class standard of living in the next 25 or 50 years. And if you just did the kind of pencil math on that. If you took the 20th century and you took out the world wars and called that 75 years and called the six industrialized countries about 20 percent of people on the planet, you're going to do it. You're going to basically move them from where the next 40 percent of people from where they are today low on a GDP curve up to basically call it a 1970s or 1980s American standard of living. But you're going to try to do that in one third the time. You're going to try to basically do it in the first half of this century. And when you think about what that means, the infrastructure that's required, the materials, the energy, all the products and services, the movement of materials around the planet, the movement of capital around the planet, I became to understand that this would be probably the driving force behind the rest of my career. And more importantly, I should say in addition to that, the byproduct of all that activity would probably be what we've come to understand is global warming because all these things need to move around and we need to move basic materials into products and products need to move around the world. And many of the 40 percent of people were talking about industrializing don't have vehicles today. They don't have houses that embody a bunch of energy. They don't have vehicles today. They don't have the personal mobility that we enjoy here in America. And so that became the basis for exploring in 2003 inside our firm, really my taking an entrepreneurial role at that time we practiced life sciences and IT. And I said, I'd like to be an entrepreneur inside of our firm. And our firm has a long history. Michael mentioned that we've been around 25 years. But I said, I'd like to go start exploring these clean tech areas and understanding where could technology in the classic sense of venture capital intersect these markets? And what were the problems that technology specifically could solve? And what I started to do in 2003 and early 2004, as I started seeing entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs that were in our IT area before. And entrepreneurs that were in the life science area. They started showing up at our doorstep, not looking for the next IT opportunity or the next biotech opportunity. But looking to either to learn more or showing up with a fledgling small entrepreneurial business saying, I'm going to start a solar company. I'm going to start a biofuels company. I'm going to address making coal clean. And really starting, we started to see the avalanche of the valley's best talent in the 2004 timeframe. What to move to these areas? Well, my job is to catalyze entrepreneurs to provide them with the capital to help them realize their dreams. And in that context, it became apparent to us in the late 2004 timeframe that we should start investing in this area. And so I led a set of investments in the 2004, 2005, 2006 timeframe. We can talk about some of them later on if we get into it. And what we've done is really state how to leadership position in the clean tech investing area. We've done about 15 investments to date across a variety of areas. And we've built an entire segment of our practice around it. So it's become something that we are committed to. It's not something we dabble in. My livelihood is made or broken on whether we make clean tech work inside of our firm. We have two of our eight general partners practicing it today. And we do essentially what we do in our other areas. We invest behind Stanford students and professors that are spinning out with interesting technology that they go over to O.T.E.L. and get licensed. We are investing behind repeat entrepreneurs that are coming from another area. We are seeding corporate spinouts of research that is inside a major corporation but is not consistent with where that corporation wants to go. And so that intellectual property and some of those people are available to spin out. And we're trying to do it all in the context of a venture capital fund. Now since 2005 this has become a very interesting and exciting area for venture capital broadly. And I think if you looked over the last three years which you'd find in 2005 some people were practicing clean tech. In 2006 it was many people. In 2007 it's most people. And I think today as we leave 2008. I think the people that aren't practicing clean tech in venture is actually a fairly small number now. I mean you can almost name them on your hand here in San Diego Road. And so in that context we've been actively investing in this area across a number of companies. It's very exciting. It's where the best talent sits for us to build entrepreneurial ventures. What are some of the investments you guys have made that you feel particularly excited about? I think the one that's probably farthest along is Nano Solar. And one of the reasons I bring that up is it has a lot of Stanford students in it and it has a lot of Stanford intellectual property in it. The basic premise behind the company as well as the founder is a Stanford PhD grad. He and Larry and Sergey and I all went to graduate school at about the same time. The premise of the company is solar is just too expensive. And if we found a way to make photovoltaic cells the same way that the nightly newspaper is printed. Think about the New York Times and the machine that generates the New York Times every day by the hundreds of thousands if not millions of copies in one day. How can we bring those printing technologies to the photovoltaic business which to date has been bootstrapped off of the semiconductor business. So in semiconductors you make money by making things increasingly smaller and packing more value into it. And so you're trying to create square kilometers of things per minute. And so the collision of those economic forces really was forcing the silicon technologies not to be able to be effective as a photovoltaic technology. So the idea was basically can we move the economics of photovoltaics to the economics of printing. And today the company is effectively in production here in South San Jose. There must be 50 to 75 Stanford people inside the company at this point. And going quite well I might say it's actually an interesting one to work with. Now when you were looking at nano solar as a business planner as a PowerPoint presentation probably with a small prototype or something like it. How did you evaluate the opportunity given that the solar business is not exactly, it's neither high growth today nor is it profitable. How did you evaluate the opportunity? Yeah so and we looked at the opportunity in late 2004. And what you saw, I think you had to have a couple observations. One, the photovoltaic market was not a domestic market. The market is driven at that time and still is today out of Japan and Germany. And so you had to know that in order to find that opportunity interesting at all. Because you would walk in and say, well come on this isn't a domestic market where we're going to sell this. No one wants to blah, blah, blah. The second thing I think you had to understand is the market was at that time about 2 billion in product sales but out of over 40% growth rate. So 40% of 2 billion has another billion and you just kind of keep compounding the 40% along and you realize, whoa this is going to be, there's lots of product being sold into this business. And as price comes down the amount grows very inelastically meaning a small price drop causes a dramatic increase in desired volume. So we worked on the market thesis and actually had that pretty well cooked before the company, we met the company. So we were actively looking for this and I think that's one of the thesis areas here in CleanTech. The opportunity specifically was, do you want to work with this entrepreneur and do you think this is the technology and the manufacturing strategy that can get it done? And so the manufacturing strategy is around creating a nanoparticulate ink that's where the nanow comes from and using printing technology to create solar cells that's where the solar comes from. The entrepreneur is actually a really interesting character, Martin Rashisen was one of the founders of trading dynamics which sold to Arriba or very early on and was also one of the founders and CEO of e-groups which sold to Yahoo and is effectively today Yahoo groups. So you had a repeat entrepreneur but the entrepreneur was not experienced in this industry. So the risk was can this entrepreneur learn a new area but the entrepreneur already demonstrated the ability to build great management teams, access capital, do a bunch of the things that are requisite in order to put a start together. And how did you decide how much to capitalize the business with? I mean it's obviously something that you could scale up pretty rapidly or start small with the seed kind of investment. How did you guys approach that problem? You know I think that's one of the challenges here in the CleanTech segment is understanding the amount of capital it takes and managing the businesses in a way so that you put enough money to get the next milestone done and most of the time when we invest the next milestone is a technical milestone. And so it really came down to a market milestone. Yeah, certain level of sales or. Get the $10 million in sales or get the product released for example. And it really comes down to sitting down with the company going through its operating plan and understanding how many people months and how much innovation is required and how much can we plan on innovation happening on Tuesday versus Wednesday. And it really understands from a bottoms up how do you put the company together. And I think that's one of the real skills you need to have in our profession is understanding how do you from a bottoms up perspective put capital and people in a plan together to make it work. And if fair to say I think that CleanTech concepts generally take significantly more capital to get to market than say a software or internet driven business fair to say. Yeah, I think in general that's going to be true. I think if you look at them in the context of the Valley back in 1980 let's say the early 80s. Most of the semiconductor companies at that time had captive manufacturing and most of them had a proprietary process technology to allow them to make some special computer widget could have been a chip could have been a computer board. And then as the industry matured other industries were grown that disaggregated all of that capital intensity. So we had foundries that we had contract manufacturers so that basically startups could focus on design, sales and marketing and there were other people to take that capital intensity. Not sure whether that will happen here. I think the capital intensity that we deal with comes in two forms. One is does the company need to build proprietary manufacturing. And the second one is the nature of the technology such that the rational format for the technology is a project, right? I.e. we're going to build a coal gasification plant. I.e. we're going to build a solar utility plant. If that's the case then it might require a significant amount of capital and the question is how much can we get the technology proven before that capital will participate. So the question of capital comes down at the end to who's capital. Sandhill Road in the venture community is going to run out of capital at a certain point. And we need to have the companies far enough along so the other forms of capital will come in and help us build them. And where do you see those sort of later stage sources of capital? Are they as excited about this as the Sandhill Road community seems to be? Well, they might have been until last week or the week before. It's something that happened. Well, for those of you that will watch this later, the company and I think more representatively, the world is in a serious financial crisis. And it's a credit crisis. And most of the monies that are used to build out the project bases of these companies and many of the investors that would participate in the late clean tech rounds are also the same kind of investors that are private equity firms, hedge funds, investment banks, some of the people that are in significant financial strates today. So I think it's unclear on a going forward basis how much if any pullback that will be. I suspect there will be some like most things, nothing's as bad as it is when you hear the worst news and it's not as great as it was when you heard the best news. So do you take any specials and I don't, you know, if I don't mean to say on a specific company, to share anything proprietary, but as you look at your portfolio or you're doing anything to respond to the current conditions that maybe say extend the runway for the venture money that they do have. Yeah, I think that's a really good point. I mean, whether you're a single person, a small family, a small business, venture backstarts or a large corporation, there's a giant pullback sound you hear today. I was speaking with a former CEO of a large automotive company who said, you know, people with 700 credit score, which is a high credit score. There's a 50% chance you won't get financing if you try to go buy a car today. That's a phenomenal thing to say that the credit is just not available in a whole bunch of different dimensions. And so what it tells us as basically managers of about a hundred startup, you know, portfolio, is this incumbent upon us to reach out to our CEOs and tell them, you know, the cost of capital is changing. We need to be thoughtful about what resources we're adding. We need to be thoughtful about what equipment we're buying. And we need to make sure we increase the likelihood with as much cash as possible of hitting our milestones. I don't think we're about to see something that we saw in part of 2002 where more or less the startup market just dried up. That's the only time in my career in 11 years in the venture business where I've seen actually good companies die. And that was a really difficult time because, you know, capital was just not available in any form. I think it's going to be tougher for good companies, but I think good companies are still going to get financed. How did you get to the point where you cared a lot about something as macro as the explosion of middle-class lifestyles on the planet earth? I mean, that's not exactly like something that occurred to me, you know, when I was deciding what to do with my life. What is it about your background or your personal passions that got you to stop and care about that problem? Yeah. One of the things that I try to be a student of the game when I was a student here, I wanted to really learn about the different students I was interacting with. I had friends that were in the medical school, I had friends who were in law school, I had friends in the business school. And one of the things I came to understand and learning about the history of Silicon Valley is that the valley is built on a set of successive waves. And one of the waves was the PC wave. So one of my core messages for the group, we'll probably get to it a little bit later, is if you did nothing, I know most of you are here for master's programs, there might be some undergraduates in the audience also. As you're thinking about what you want to do when you leave this room, the number one thing I would advise you that would be smart to do is to figure out how to find a long wave. Some immutable trend that is going to permeate most of the 10 year of your career, the next 15 to 30 years. If you sat down and said, what are the big long waves that are going to happen during my lifetime? Jumping on one of them as a professional will probably be one of the smartest moves you ever do. Because if you did nothing, but jumping into the computer business in the late 70s, early 80s, even maybe all the way up to the Microsoft IPO, you had a phenomenal run, a phenomenal run, 20 something years, maybe 25 years where you had a very high chance, much higher chance in the average person of achieving a higher position, perhaps more material income, and just being in a better place. Then if you'd chosen, for example, Detroit. And so I think you got to think about what wave you're on and how do you get on the wave that makes sense for you both from an interest perspective, a geography perspective, what you want to do with your life. I decided that this was going to be a very long wave. This would probably be the most impactful wave. You can imagine what the other ones are. It's easiest to see them right here on campus. Because if you go read the last, I read just this last week, the last statement that comes out from Dean Plummer from the School of Engineering, he tells you what the school's focused on. The school's focused in three big areas. Information technology, which it has been for a long time, that's kind of the most mature of the three areas that's really pursuing. Bioengineering and moving biology to a quantitative science and energy and the environment. Those are the three thrusts inside the School of Engineering right now. Guess what? Five to ten years from now? Those are the students and professors and technologies that spin out and do startups. Why is the school oriented there? Because those are where the big challenges are. That's where they can recruit faculty to. That's where they can find research grants from. And so what you're seeing, research universities are the start of the waves. So you're here at Ground Zero on it. You just have to look around and see what they are. Understand what research is going on on campus. So I don't know whether you know, clean techs the one for you. But I would tell you the number one thing you can do is figure out what wave are you writing. And make sure you're not on a wave that's going down. Let's assume that some students at least a few in the audience would feel that clean tech is a long wave they want to ride. You talked before about your thesis based in investment. You've got some beliefs about where the best places are to invest. Can you share some of those with the students so they can narrow it down a bit? Because I think there's some fundamental forks in the road for the students when they think about the difference between something like nano solar or a company like Amorous, which was a guest in this class last year, which for those that don't know is using synthetic biology to convince yeast cells to eat sugar and excrete diesel fuel, which actually works when you put it into a diesel engine. Those are very different paths on the clean tech kind of wave. How should the students think about the various alternatives within that long wave? Sure. So I think there's a couple macro trends inside of it. The easiest way to deconstruct this is to think about the specific problem you're solving. So today we use far too much carbon in a variety of areas. So in general low carbon solutions are going to be preferred over high carbon solutions going forward. Most leaders in the world today and most captains of industry believe by 2012 we're going to have per ton of CO2 emission taxes. They could be cap and trade. There's a whole bunch of market mechanisms we could go live all day in the economics school and try to figure this out. The reality being is that carbon is going to become the third currency on this planet. There's the cost of capital. There's the cost of a barrel of oil. And the next one's going to be cost of a ton of CO2. And technologies that are going to allow the world's big industries to move to lower carbon solutions are going to be attractive ones. Those are going to be places where tons of existing investment are going to need to be sloshed over into new solutions. And careers are made when typewriters are left in the dust and people buy computers. And then they put one on that, that desk and then that other desk and this one. And that takes up a very long time. And when you move something as gigantic as the energy infrastructure on this planet through these new technologies, it is going to be a very long wave because the average life span of a power plant is about 50 years. And so you've got 50 years of replacement just to replace what's there today. The second one I would say relates to the relative advantage of different countries. So we are oil poor. We are coal rich. So solutions that are going to carry the day in America are going to be solutions that help our low oil position, i.e. agriculture based renewables for transportation fuel. Which amers is one of the variety of companies pursuing that. Or things that allow us to consume the resource we already have, i.e. coal in a smart and thoughtful way such as we don't add to a high carbon problem. And so I think if you, that's the second one. The third one is we need to be more energy efficient. We consume far too much. Another way to think about my thesis of the middle classes, how many more Americans are we generating on this planet? If you think about the average American as a consumption unit, you know there's X many hundred million Americans. Well, every year we're adding a couple hundred million more because there's more Americans from a consumption perspective being generated. And so how do we reduce that overall average such that we're more energy efficient resource efficient. Why do we sling plastic, you know, plastic bottles of water all over the planet? It's kind of a silly thing to think about. Yeah, there's a variety of things that we do that you would not do if you were starting today. You just would not do them. They don't make sense. So I think it's about figuring out what problem, what's the high level problems being solved and then finding the solutions that sit within those. Those will be the specific companies and industries that get created. When you first started caring about the sector and even today, how do you keep up with the current state of research? What do you read? What do you look at? Who do you talk to to stay up to date on what's happening? This is a big challenge. Basically, one of the challenges to being an investor in clean tech is knowing what you want to invest in. If you're an early-stage investor like us, you need to know what you're looking for because you can't sit there and wait till things come in your door. If you do, you're going to be purely reactive and you'll always be behind the curve. So I would argue if you looked at the better venture capitalists, what you'll find is they're most of them are thesis driven. They have some point of view. They're able to articulate it. They're able to attract the right entrepreneurs through their description and marketing of that message. The challenge is to stay relevant in the places where research can be harnessed and extracted. There's a common perception, and if you read Tom Freeman's work, you'll see one of his favorite metaphors is the world is flat. Actually, in innovation, it's exactly the opposite. The most interesting research in this world happens basically on 10 to 12 campuses, and this is one of them. It's not uniformly spread over the United States. It's just not true. It may be true for shipping goods around the planet, but it's certainly not true for extracting innovation and making innovation happen. So the challenge for a clean tech investor is mining those areas where research is happening. Who are the top three professors at Stanford, MIT, Caltech, Georgia Tech, CMU, that are doing the specific areas that match up with one of your thesis areas we talked about earlier. And that's I think the way you can better hone and find out what's going on with different research means. What are the other long waves that you pay attention to? Obviously, you're not solely spending 24 by 7 and just the clean tech area. I think one of the advantages of having a diversified venture firm where we practice across information technology, life science, and clean tech. It's we're able to harness the intersections of those. So if you think about biofuels or bioengineering, that has applications in clean tech, but it's also has applications in life sciences. And so where appropriate, we interact. Solar looks a lot like semiconductors, early semiconductors. So lessons and competency in semiconductors often bleeds over into the solar and manufacturing aspects of photovoltaics. The other long wave I think that we have here before us is along with making hundreds of millions of more middle class consumers, we basically have we've basically set ourselves up to have a set of lifestyle diseases. And I think if you look around and you look at the amount of obesity and the amount of lifestyle problems that people have, one of the most interesting things I did a couple of years ago. I came down here to campus and I looked at some of the newspapers that were at the turn of the last century. And one of the big concerns about a hundred years ago is we were not going to be able to feed people on this planet. There simply was not enough high quality farmland to produce crops and therefore food for all the people that lived in the cities. And so we were going to face significant problems coming into the 20th century. Well with the advent of fertilizer, that problem just went away. Technology came to the rescue and solved the problem. It solved it so profoundly that we now have a global obesity epidemic. I mean it crushed that problem, right? The same way that 25 years of venture investment crushed all of the telecom and networking problems, not all of them. But the amount of bandwidth you get sitting here in this room compared to even when I was sitting in this chair 14 years ago is tremendous. In fact, it's free as insulting. Somebody's got to make money somewhere, right? The challenge I think for us is to better manage lifestyle conditions and to better understand how our bodies work as a quantitative science. And today we're at the very earliest of stages. We still don't know why we give cancer treatment A or B to a person. We still don't understand some of the basic mechanisms of how our bodies work. And because of that, we do things that in retrospect from today just look silly. I mean I think I'll give you an example. About 30% of cancer treatments don't work and they don't find out that they would not have worked until the cancer becomes more developed. That's because there's no diagnostics today to tell the doctor whether they should give you treatment A or treatment B. So they basically make an educated guess. But in the meantime, your cancer's developed two or three months farther. That's just a lack of technology that can't tell the doctor or provide any diagnostic at the molecular level about who you are specifically separate from the person that's sitting next to you. And because of that, we apply these very broad brushes in medicine today that make no sense if you actually understood people's genetic makeup. So if you look at a lot of what's happening here on campus and happening at some of the best research universities, it's how do we take biology, which if you think about your biology courses, we're always kind of separate from the rest of your engineering and kind of hardcore sciences. Because it was much more of a liberal art as a scientific area. There was a lot to be learned and it was basically memorization. Here's how we think it works. And you think about your hard sciences were much more experimental driven. Because there's actually the laws of physics or understood, the laws of chemistry for the most part understood. Inorganic chemistry is a fairly well-defined field. Biology is very much not. And so I think the other long way that sits right before you is how are we going to deal with and provide solutions for basically our lifestyle diseases, which are going to dominate I think the next 20 to 50 years. Because think about it. 150 years ago people didn't have subway and quiz nose and everything sitting right outside their door. I mean people actually had to work to find food today. Today it's just everywhere around you. Calories are just taken for granted. And I think figuring out how to fix that and better manage that will be a huge business. In several of the long waves you're mentioning, not just clean tech but also health care and biotech, there's a big public policy component that I'd love to get your thought. We don't know yet who's going to be president. But what advice would you have for either candidate with respect to public policy that needs to support the kind of growth that you're talking about? I think it's a great point. And I think more so today than ever before. Venture is more policy influence than it has been. There's kind of two sides of it. One is I think for the first time with the passage of the significant legislation that came through on Monday I believe. We now have at least in solar and a couple other of the renewable areas for the first time ever policy that has a time horizon of eight years, which gives enough of a signal to Silicon Valley and to research universities and entrepreneurs that you can orient this way. And you can practice your business knowing what the business environment and framework will be around it versus historically in renewables here in the United States. We've had an incentive one year then we turn it off then we turn it on then we turn off then a new center comes in we turn it back on. And the message to businesses we don't know what we're doing so don't trust anything here right I mean this is all just this is not a serious issue and we just waffle back and forth. I think now with the current passage of the extension of the investment tax credit and others. I think for the first time you're starting to see people be serious about these areas as a growth business. And also for securing jobs and manufacturing capacity in the United States. The second part of it is to realize that most of these industries are not dominated by the United States. And so I think more so in clean tech than in our other practice areas the markets for these companies are not domestic the biggest markets are international. And the question is how do you service those markets from Palo Alto or Houston or New York City that's a challenge that other areas around the world that have startups have dealt with more so than Silicon Valley. But I think we're learning how to do it. Policy is an increasing part of the landscape and one that the value I think is learning how to do. Now one maybe radical perspective on policy might say that one of the biggest problems we face in the United States is the gas isn't expensive enough. And that it would be somewhere around 10 to 12 dollars a gallon before people would consumer markets would actually be willing to make the conversions necessary in their consumption patterns to really make a difference. Is anything like that required here or do you see that the natural tendency of consumers will gravitate them towards these greener technologies just by good conscience? You know I think there's two points of view I think if you look at Europeans broadly speaking their nature is to try to get into government to do the right thing and be very prescriptive and the nature of most American businesses those guys are messed up in Washington and I just need stability whatever it is and I'll figure out how to work around it. And it's a very different point of view and I think you're going to see both of them practice and I think certain states may lead over the federal government in these areas. Whether they're strong supporters or not will just shift the relative market share these technologies around I don't think it will dramatically affect the market sizes. I think we should expect the federal government to be last because they typically are in these areas. California and some other states tend to lead and then policy gets adopted the national level later on. Before I turn the floor over to Sruti who has our first question today I want to just ask you are one of the founding principles behind the creation of this class. What year was that 1996? Tell the students why you started or how this came to be. Oh sure. So back in 1995 the guys in Yahoo Jerry and David were a couple trailers away from you down here next to the CS building and when I came to realize was many of the people that were graduate students at the time were just disappearing. Meaning they go to their research group meaning and they would be gone and they were being sucked up into many of the big IT technology companies that you know today see them when you drive up and down 101 Cisco Waricle a whole bunch of other places and the tech boom was really taking off. And myself and a couple other people on campus basically decided I don't know whether this is the economically better decision or not but we decided at the time that we weren't going to give up our PhD programs and we're going to start basically orchestrating student entrepreneurship here on campus. That basically became the basis organization. One of the programs that we were running was kind of start up CEO come in and talk for an afternoon and we'll provide some pizza and some soft drinks and wouldn't that be great. Well because the early instanciations of that were not regular meaning like every week at a certain time it was really hard to build audience. So one of the things we decided to do with the help of Tom Cosnik and Tom Bires and Tom Bires was just recently recently on campus is we decided to basically integrate that into a class so we could have partially a captive audience be able to upgrade that should be really honest. Be able to upgrade the speakers by being able to market a larger audience to them and the thing took off like wildfire. And so it became a class I believe in 1996 as one unit like it is today. No obviously over the internet you know watch it on a flash player that didn't exist. So you actually had to show up or you could be at a Fortune 500 that's a subscriber to the Stanford Professional Development Organization. I think they sent you a VHS tape just to let you know how how dinosaurs that was. Do you know what that is? Yeah. Box looking things. And it took off like wildfire and we would fill terminatorium with about whatever is 400 people and there was basically no one during that time we couldn't get to campus and the pitch was very simple I did many of the much of the recruiting for some of the speakers and my pitch was really simple. There's 500 people going to be in this auditorium about a third of them from the Stanford Business School about two thirds from the school of engineering a smattering of people from law and law and the medical school and others and they're either going to work for you or they're going to be your competitors do you want to show up. The answer to that question almost always was I got to come and it was very effective so it worked phenomenally and so ETL was kind of born out of that. Excellent. Are you ready? Sruti came to me before class began and asked if she could please that. No I'm teasing I cold-cultored but I did it at the beginning of class so she's ready now. Yeah. How do you decide if there's a difference between which company to invest in? Basically you're driving at the moral fiber of partnerships and so partnerships come in every flavor some of them are command and control meaning I decide and you do and some of them are much more flat. R is tends to be on the flat side if you looked at our discussions when coming to Monday for us to make investment decisions there's a document that gets made by the advocate the person supporting the investment. And then the other people from that investment team basically are able to add their opinions into that document so that the rest of my partners think about my partners from life science or information technology they get to read something that looks somewhat like our supreme court kind of brief or the leading opinion is being. You know said but there's the dissenting positions are in there I think the coming can do this well we're not quite sure I think this is a bigger risk than Eric thinks it is and so that document then provides a basis for discussion at the end of it we basically decide whether we think the risks are manageable and there's some risk that we control and someone's we don't things we control how much money gets spent how much money goes into the company whether we want to invest or not. Do we like this management team who needs to be added in what order and can we influence it things we don't control are whether the market develops if it's a it's a new market not so much an issue clean tech with a huge issue and information technology people walk in on a Monday and it's someone you know 23 years old and says. You got to take a look at this technology because in two years 100 million people are going to be doing this on their mobile phone. Your ideas your opinion on that is as good as the next guys so then it comes down to a whole bunch of you know how do you manage the risk in the in the capital intensity and what gives you the conviction around doing something I think it in partnerships understanding how to work the work the risk and be able to be transparent is really difficult your questions are very good one. Yes. Talk about categorizing your opinion in terms of what all we are trying to solve and the also the importance of making investment thesis. How do you think about the trade off between possibly mutually exclusive solutions like say electric cars and battery technology versus biofuels especially given that these are really big bets and you make them over really long term. Yeah that's an excellent question. There's two answers there's two answers you can either come bottoms up or tops down the top down answer is it's unlikely that any one technology dominates all applications. I think it's a lot easier to see how someone that lives in downtown San Francisco that drives from the Marina to the financial district for example could do that on electric vehicle. The person who drives an interstate truck you know through the Mojave desert or the person that drives a tractor both of those vehicles have four wheels and an internal combustion engine today. But I think what ends up happening is the technology becomes very application specific. And so the question is does the technology does the investment you're making have a large enough market in the time frame of interest and the time frame review being an adventure investor in it. Such that it's reasonable that you could get the rate of return that you that you need. I think at some point you know if battery technology was perfect you know you could imagine that dominating a big chunk of the miles driven total miles driven. I think you're going to end up in applications though where you're going to have a transportation for very long period of time. The average US car is on the road meeting registered to drive about 11 or 12 years. So even if you had the perfect battery technology today and all the grid infrastructure to do it it would take you approximately 11 years to turn over the vehicle fleet. So you end up in these things where I think there's going to be a number of solutions in this in this medium period. And the question is is the steady state solution a hybrid or is the state state solution complete electrification and I think technology is going to technology and marketing are going to be the battleground there not always the best technology wins. Sometimes the best marketing wins. In the back. You could comment on what you've observed in clean coal. Sure. His question was could I comment on what we've seen in clean coal. There's a variety of ways to approach the problem. One is you could figure out how to upgrade the coal before it's combusted. You know coal is basically our most fundamental energy technology a little bit over 50% of all the electricity produced in the country. So that's from coal. What we do is very simple. We dig it up like a birthday cake. Stick it in a boiler. Burn it. Make steam and use the steam to generate electricity. That's the entire degree of sophistication. Now particularly sophisticated. Huge amount of CO2 and other things come up with coal. Mercury, sulfur, a whole bunch of things that are not good for the environment. You could either upgrade the coal before it is combusted. You could figure out how to clean the coal after it's burned. Basically some type of exhaust or emissions cleanup technology. You could figure out how to use the coal closer to where it is so that the effects of it remain in situ. I.e. you don't drag the coal on a rail car across the country to use it. And I think the last one is you figure out how to sequester the bad stuff. And you can use CO2 and some of the byproducts of coal for enhanced oil recovery. So enhanced oil recovery is just pumping CO2 into the ground to try to get the next barrel of oil to come out of an oil field. That's actually a very attractive thing to do when oil prices are this high. So there's actually a shortage if you could believe it of CO2 pipeline CO2 today in America. If you had some, we would all be on our way to being very happy. I think the long term goal is to figure out how do you take the byproducts of coal and turn them into other economically valuable products. So things you could make that have very large markets that you could make with the output of CO2. You could make other fuels, i.e. carbon and oxygen or the building blocks along with hydrogen, to make any fossil fuel or any plastic. So if you could have, you CO2 as a feedstock to start to build something else. The problem is that when you think about how much coal we consume, you start to run out of markets that could absorb the amount of CO2 that's produced. So some of the things you could make, and there's companies that are doing this today, you could make building materials out of it. You could make fuels, transportation fuels out of it. You could make some very broad-based plastics and chemical precursors out of it. But after that you start to run out. I did a calculation once. It was something like some small fraction of the US coal fleet would generate the entire amount of antifreeze. I think every car drives around with a couple gallons of antifreeze in it. The entire supply of antifreeze in like four hours. So you have to find something that has a really, really big market. And you end up in building materials and fuels and kind of basic chemicals. If you could find a way to close the loop on CO2 there, then I think you'd have a way to more responsibly burn coal. You need to find somewhere to put the carbon dioxide. Yes. I've read some press in the past year that some high-profile people have said that in clean tech, it's one way I think clean tech on things, specifically energy. A lot of the major innovations are going to come from established companies, say like a general electric, a chef even a chevron or something like that. What's your perspective on that outlook? Biosed. If you look at where innovation stems from today, if we were to rewind 30 years, you had places like Xerox Park that were spitting out some of the foundational IT technologies, you had the Bell Labs, you had a variety of corporate research universities that were funded in an era where Wall Street wasn't so focused on companies quarter to quarter operating profit. This R&D was viewed as a beneficial thing that was feeding the product pipeline. Somewhere in the last 20 years that got lost. So large corporations shed those entities. There are still significant R&D that goes on in corporations, but it's by far lower than what they do themselves. Example of that is look at who funded the $500 million grant for the Berkeley Energy Bioconversion Institute. It's BP. They could have done the $500 million in house. They're not short on change these days. Look who funds the G-SET project here at Stanford. It's Toyota. It's chevron. It's a variety of others. Honda. These are people that are looking for innovation and they know they can't keep the nation's best and brightest on their balance sheet. And so universities are really the place that have inherited most of the R&D in America these days. They're going to be able to move around the world but certainly here in America that's the case. And the world's not flat. The top 10 research universities produce a dominant share of things that go on to be breakthrough technology. So it really becomes an issue of how do you catalyze that technology out of here? I think when you get to the scale of some things that are in energy and materials. You may know that commercializes that may be a very large company. But there may have been a startup that got acquired along the way or a startup that really is the deliver of that core technology. And the branding and the marketing and the public face of it may be a very large company. Wind was that way for example. Now most people think a wind they think GE. Well GE bought their way into the wind business. They didn't just conjure it up internally. And so startups, whether they're standalone companies like some of which you know, or they're acquired through M&A. I think pretty fundamental to the innovation engine of America. Yes sir. You mentioned this a little bit about the political policies of type startups. Let's say if you're not interested in going into dealing something to do with carbon costs and all that stuff. Right now there's no policy. This is going to go carbon taxes. It's going to go carbon debt and trade. How do you remain agile in a really politically sensitive type topic? And if you want to be honest with me, what is that type of? How do you remain agile in such a broad or at least prepared? So I did everybody hear that question. In light of the uncertainty around what's going to happen with, I'm going to paraphrase with respect to carbon reduction. Whether that might be a tax based regime or a cap and trade marketplace driven regime. How do you as an entrepreneur remain flexible and preserve your options for growing a new business in such an uncertain environment? I think that's a great question. The thing I would think about is like in most areas in clean tech, the United States is a laggard. It's really hard for people that grew up on these shores to understand but we are in many areas a laggard. Asia and Europe are far ahead of us in this. And so I would look for the places where this is being practiced today and the relative merits and market share of those mechanisms. The United States will likely, I think if it's going to be a good citizen, I think the next regime, next administration will be a better corporate global citizen than this current one. And in that regard, I think it will adopt market mechanisms that appear to be working elsewhere. And so I would look for what's the dominant market mechanism in Europe and Asia. Yes, sir. I was told one of these solar technologies being worked on is panels that are painted onto your car or painted onto the ceiling of a building. So there's nothing about that. Solar panels that are painted onto surfaces. Let me recharge. You know, it was biopinated. It was simply the pain of the vehicle. That would take us to the Ray Bradbury moment of this talk. I think there's actually work being done to look at technologies like that. I think they're relatively still far off. So if you're a professor down at Caltech that is working on manufacturing techniques, you could use that while the pain is drawing, you could use electric fields or magnetic fields to orient the particles and be able to create vies and bus bars to get power out. But to date, I don't know of any material you can really paint on and pull power out of. I think it's a research area for the future. Yes, sir. I was just wondering, what do you see as the, what do you see are the advantages that contact the solar thermal, which is sort of matured? So our basic premise for picking photovoltaics over solar thermal is that semiconductor have a much better chance of significant cost reduction than the components that are solar thermal. So the thermal's primary constituents are cement, steel, aluminum and glass, which are the world's most basic materials. They're a lot likely, if you believe the building other middle classes around the world, they're not likely to be the materials that are going to be getting cheaper. The big advantage of solar thermal is the fact that it's probably doable today. It hasn't been done at the scale points that people are envisioning it. But the big advantage is that you have storage as part of the solution. So the problem with wind or photovoltaics is, and only works when that resource is around, and I eat the sun or the wind blowing, the idea with solar thermals to be able to store 24 hours worth of energy and be able to draw upon it when you want. So you're really using solar thermal to charge some reservoir of heat, and then you draw the heat whenever you need it. And I think that's an attractive thing for utilities, and I think it has its place in the energy landscape. Our personal investing practice was just that, you know, we think photovoltaics looks a lot more like something that could be on Moore's Law, and there's going to be a lot more cost reduction potential in that technology. Yes. Could you speak a little bit about nuclear energy, and how does it fit in? You know, it's the kind of thing that either gets included in discussion, or it doesn't, depending on the audience, that would be perfectly honest, because it has attributes of being a clean technology. The real challenge here in America is that it's not that people don't like nuclear energy. It's that we do not have an effective mechanism to dispose of nuclear waste. And so the issue is actually a waste issue, not a power issue. The challenge, I think, is overcoming public perception, and the time it takes to actually make it operational. So if you and I wanted to go start a nuclear power plant, it'd take us about 10 to 12 years from today before we generate the first kilowatt electricity. And because of that, it has a longer time horizon. It should be probably something that's feathered in all the time, meaning you should probably be building capacity all the time, in my opinion. But it's not something you can dial up or dial down quickly, like a coal plants or natural gas plants. So it's something you have to kind of have a long term perspective on. The reality is, I think, a big chunk of the future generation is going to have to be nuclear, because we're facing resource constraints in a bunch of other fossil fuels. In order to power China, there's some ridiculous statistic, like you have to turn on a power plant, and they do a lot of coal, but you have to turn on a nuclear power plant once every two weeks or something to keep powering that country. It's like, okay, with a 10-year backlog, we're already like 900 plants in the red there. It is the base load technology that makes the most sense, base load, meaning the power that runs all the time. So I want to thank you. This has been terrific. Eric's been kind enough to say he'd stick around for a few minutes, if there were some questions from you guys that you didn't get a chance to answer. I had to, I just wanted to say we're two things, sorry, the hovering makes me nervous. I'm just kidding. So a couple of things that you said are things that are sticking with me in a big way. One is that this idea of innovation being very lumpy, that it's not a smooth distribution, that there's places where it clumps together. This being one of them, I think, is a terrific insight to share with these students. The second was that there's a lot of old school ideas, and things, I heard you talk about things like the economies of scale and experience in production of photovoltaic production. These are old school ideas that are being applied to new, whole new categories of products, and it's reassuring to me because I grew up thinking about economies of scale and mass old school production. It's nice to see that they still apply here. The third thing that I'll remember very clearly is you talking about milestone and thesis based investing. It's probably one of the most interesting angles to clean tech because I don't know your name, but I believe you talked about it was a brilliant point. Long time horizons and uncertain paybacks and large capital commitments, the best way to mitigate those in this sort of new sector is to think about, is to think about your funding to the next scientific milestone or your funding to the next meaningful milestone, and your funding only those things that fit your thesis. I think those very powerful concepts. Probably the thing though that I would just repeat for the students is this idea of long waves. There is no substitute for having the wind at your back not blowing in your face. You can work just as hard into completely unrelated industries, and when the wind is at your back you'll have a lot more fun, you'll have a lot more opportunity, and you'll probably be a lot more successful than if it's barreling in your face. So I thought that was a terrific one, and thank you very much for coming today.
