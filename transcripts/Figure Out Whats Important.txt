 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. My honor and privilege to introduce both Catherine Goals and Mike Malone to you today. So let me start with Catherine. Catherine has an amazing bio. She was the founder of VC firm Foundation Capital in 1995, a firm well known for consumer investments such as Netflix and Lending Club, where she focused on V2B technology companies. She was selected for the Midas list based on her investments in companies like Grand Junction Networks, Documentum and Interwoven. Her lifetime IRR in the VC business is 90%. Let me tell you that is an astounding number. And her average investment returned 8x. That is also an astounding number. Foundation Capital has several billion under management starting from a first fund of 75 million. Before foundation, Catherine was a general partner in another firm and was the original marketing VP at Oracle in the early 1980s. Since retiring from Foundation Capital in 2006, she's helped three micro VC firms raise money and get started. From firms I think they're familiar to many of you in the room. Floodgate, Pedgeman Mar and most recently engineering capital. She continues to coach and invest time and money in these firms. In 2009, she started Battle Mountain Vineyard, where she and her husband make premium Cabernet wine. She enjoys flying airplanes, plane air painting and continues her lifelong devotion to playing the violin. She also enjoys advising her son Alex as he develops his engineering consulting business. She earned an MBA at the University of Chicago where she is on the board of trustees and was selected as a distinguished alum in 2006. She spoke at the University of Chicago Boost School of Business commencement last June. And her BS is in physics from the University of Toronto. If that weren't enough. Joining her on stage is Michael Malone, an author, journalist and television host. After earning two degrees from Santa Clara University, he joined the San Jose Mercury News as the world's first daily high tech reporter. There he was nominated twice for Pulitzer Prizes in Invest Ticketive Reporting. Malone has been a columnist for the New York Times, ABC News and Forbes. At Forbes, he was editor in chief of the nation's largest circulation high tech business magazine, Forbes ASAP. He's the author or co-author of nearly 20 books of business, history and biography, including several bestsellers. The host of four PBS interviews series, he was co-producer and writer of the Emmy nominated PBS Primetime mini series, The New Heroes. And is a regular op-ed contributor to the Wall Street Journal. And has recently published a book that you just told me hit the best, what was the award? You just... I just wrote a book of 2014. Yeah, that. So congratulations on that. So without further ado, let me leave you to Katherine and Michael. Great. Good to see you again. So how did you get into venture capital? Do you say you had a crazy path to Silicon Valley? Give me a little history. Yeah, okay. You guys got to hear this. The years of my life was pretty random and my business life. And so if any of you undergrads think you might kind of suck at career planning or don't have a career plan, listen to this. If I can do it, you can do it. So... Where were you born? I was born in LA, but went to school at University of Toronto because I'm retarded about weather. So... Anyway, so... Yeah, so I'll just run through this real quick because it's so crazy. So raised in LA and this violin playing thing has been a lifelong thing with me. So I studied music at USC starting before I was in college. And so then I wanted to study to major in physics. Like I didn't think to change. So I went to USC briefly. And Caltech didn't take women back in the late 60s. So I would love to have gone to Caltech, but that didn't work out. So... Anyway, but I had a boyfriend at Caltech. So I got to use their computers. So I bootleg time on their CDC 6600 and I literally learned to program Fortran out of the trash can there. I pick up listings, study them, and that's how I learned Fortran. Anyway, but then I went to University of Toronto and majored in physics at a real science engineering school and that was good. And I also wrote a bunch of Fortran programs there for their IBM 360. It was writing curve fitting routines back then. Anyway, so BS in physics and then I just... I thought I wanted to go on for a PhD in physics, but I had an opportunity to be an intern at Argonne Lab in Chicago. And so I took that and got more free programming time on mini computers and wrote a bunch of simulations for quantum mechanical processes and stuff like that. But more importantly, I figured out after a year doing that that I didn't want to be a physicist. So I went and got an engineering job in Chicago. So I started in engineering at a big company Chicago Bell and Hal, which is no longer in existence. And then I realized that I didn't know anything about accounting and all that business jazz. So I went off to University of Chicago and got an MBA. Then I went to another big company in Chicago. So finally, so like... And I love computers this whole time and I was really thinking, what am I doing here? I really should be in the computer business. But I'm glad I didn't jump too early because if I had, I would have ended up in Boston at a mini computer company and that's not where I wanted to be. So when the micropossessor got invented, that's when I got really anxious and finally came out here. So it was the... It was the 8,000-8 that convinced you to move to Silicon Valley? I have to say, there's more like the Z80. Oh, okay. Still Federico. Yeah. Really. So when personal computers started happening, that's when I said, okay, they can't do this without me. I got to be out there. So I left and by then, of course, I'd have kind of a big job there. So my CEO at the large company I left was like, you can't leave. You're the highest ranking woman in the company. I was a division marketing manager. So anyway, so it was a little bit hard to leave, but not that hard. So I came out here and joined my first startup. Well, I didn't know what I was doing. So I interviewed at tandem and Apple and Intel. Those were the kind of big companies back then. But I said, heck, I really want to do a startup. So I'm not going to join one of those. So I ended up with this weird logic of joining the smallest company that made me an offer. I just said, that's what I was going to do. And so I joined this company called Data Systems Design. I don't know if you know this. They're long gone. They're long gone. Yeah. And they made PDP 11 peripherals back in the day. This is like 1980. And one of the cool things is that one of our customers was Larry Ellison, who was writing Oracle and PDP 11 assembler and a little suite up at Sand Hill Road. And so I went to meet Larry and somewhere along the line. And I was like, oh, I've got to be at Oracle. And here's where chance favors have prepared mine. Just one of my favorite things. Because all those years that I wasted at big companies, I did develop a perspective of what big companies needed. And when I saw this product, I was like, this is going to change the world, the big company data world. And I got to be there. Well, you know, that's always been a debate, whether you should go work for a big company for a while and get perspective or go start in a small company and escape all the damage that a big company does to you. Yeah, right. Big debate right now. Yeah. And where do you come down on it? Well, in my day, and in my career in the 40 years since then, I've always advised young people to go get a job at Intel or Oracle or Google or some good place. It's going to teach you some stuff and then go start a company. I'm not so sure that's the right advice now. The advice I still have now though is whatever you do, make sure you're learning from really, really smart people. But the big company thing, I don't know, it's changing so fast. But for me, it was great to have the perspective of what big companies need as far as software and data networking and all the stuff I made all that money in in the company. And the capital business was in part informed by the market, the end user view I had from my eight years at big companies. So your second employer in the valley was Oracle? Yes, sir. How many people were there? Like 15. But I wasn't employed number 15 because Larry had gone through a few people, so. Yeah. That's probably more like, I don't know, 25ish. Did you have any sense it was going to be Oracle? Yes, I did. Even though our sales numbers back then were 1,3 million, 5 million, 12 million. So that's not like, that's good, but it's not like off the charts. That was 81, 82834. And then after the 12 million, it doubled every year for a long time. And the reason I had a sense it was going to be Oracle was, firstly, because Larry is truly the best entrepreneur I've ever met. The man's amazing. Okay, I was going to ask you about that because I mean, he obviously has a very unique reputation. Yeah? Yeah, yeah. Now, one of them is Oracle, when it was going full-bore, was an absolute insane pressure cooker. I mean, the joke always was, the first year you're there, you think you've landed the best job in the world. The second year you're there, you begin to wonder what's wrong with you. And the third year you're in intensive therapy. Was it like that when you were there? I don't think quite that Larry was still getting his style organized. And so I remember a side of Larry that I don't think he lets show very often nowadays. But he loved to laugh. He had a huge sense of humor. We spent, if we weren't yelling at each other, we were laughing. And so it was a very funny but intense time. And there was also some, I mean, the term spitting mad, I actually have seen that. And so, but the important thing about Oracle as a business was, which is a little dinky thing in this little tiny, sweet and sand-hill. And the phone was ringing all the time. People were really interested in what we had. And they were like, we couldn't wait to get the product. And of course, you know, there was a lot of bugs to fix. And it was like not an easy product to build. So what did you learn about working for a company growing that fast? I mean, there's really not much that gets taught about being in a, you know, a comment like startup where it's doubling in size every six months or three months. Right. And none of us had ever done it before either. There was nobody to go ask. Yeah. Well, there was, there was Don Lucas upstairs from us who actually invested like 50K or something, I don't know. And so he was kind of some great here around there. But it was just breathless. And all that mattered to Larry rightly so, I think that then was engineering and sales, like marketing, what I didn't matter, which is why I had a sales quota. So I did the OEM sales and that was fine. And that's why I really learned to sell. Very important. So all you engineers out there, if you're going to do startups, make sure you learn how to sell really important. And I know my sons and engineers, so I know that engineers are like, what? I don't want to sell. I don't like salesmen. Get over that. Now, there's another aspect of Larry's reputation that I wanted to bring up. You and I had lunch one day with Pat House, who was just a counterpart of yours at Oracle. And I asked both of you and she went on, of course, to be CEO of Sebel Systems and all that. I don't understand how two strong women like two of you could work at a place for Larry Ellison. And you guys took great umberage at that. You almost yelled at me over the table. Why? I mean, he does have a certain reputation. I still can't remember what I said there. But you said because he's a damn good, he's the world's greatest expert on database management. Yeah. And a great entrepreneur. Larry's an amazing guy. And he is he is agnostic as far as I can tell about women. I mean, look at Safricats nowadays. And so he doesn't care who you are, what you are as long as you're great at what you do. And so, you know, I'm a defender of Larry on. So how long you'd Oracle? I was only there for three years. And that was your last real job. It was. It was the last time you ever worked for anybody. It was. That you have like some epiphany. You know that you're walking alongside the bay underneath the emerald towers. And you just said, I don't want to work for anybody anymore? Sort of. But my epiphany was that I got fired. Oh, a little bit. Larry used to express extreme displeasure by firing people. And he would, I think I'd probably been fired a couple of times before, but it was just bullshit and I didn't pay attention to it. But this time, he really fired me. And like, I didn't get hired back until after lunch. And so he really meant it. And I thought, shit, that sucks. I'm not doing that anymore. So I think the term nowadays is you incorporated. I decided, oh, sorry. I wasn't going to do that anymore. And so I quit. I stayed there for a few more months, but I was just grumpy and I quit. And that's what happened. But then I was like, geez, I don't want to work for a startup that's not as good as Oracle and believe me, there wasn't another company as good as Oracle at the time. So I was like, ooh, I got to think something up. And so let me ask you one quick question. I don't think this ever gets addressed either. What do you do on the morning after you quit a place like Oracle where you have no job prospects yet? You don't know exactly what you're going to do. Well, no, it wasn't that bad. We're going to do it. Yeah. I had lots of job prospects. People were calling me about startups that sucked. I mean, by then this was 1984. So there was some venture capital. There was a few companies starting. So wasn't there? Other than Apple, though, it was kind of an ugly startup era. I, you know, and Bill Cross IIIcom was talking about the marketing VP of 3com. That would have been legit, right? But I didn't want to do that. So anyway, so I got kind of, so this is another like crazy career move. I thought, well, heck, I'll just be an executive recruiter because I was getting called by all these recruiters. I'm thinking there have been more fun than I'm having. So I started an executive search firm, which seems really crazy. But my plan was that it was going to be a temporary thing. It'd be like a cool way to look for another startup. And I thought I'd maybe do it for a year. But it turned out I did it for five years. I really loved it, although five years was enough. So I started recruiting people like me, other marketing VP's. But then I branched into sales VPs and engineering VP's. And then pretty soon I started getting called to do searches for CEOs for venture capital firms. And so I did all that stuff. And had a baby? True. For you ladies, it was on my mind when I did this was also, oh, I could have that baby, which is like getting kind of late in the day for me. So I did that. And I to the state don't know how you can have a baby and do a real startup, no clue. So I couldn't. So I did it that way. And it was great. So I got my baby. It was now 27 years old. Yeah. And doing what? And he's a mechanical engineer. I have a great time. Anyway. So yeah, so the recruiting thing turned out to be a really interesting career move. I'm not recommending it, but I'm just saying do interesting stuff. So how did you become a VC? Yeah, so most people that want to be a VC find it really hard to get into the business. But most people, even very successful people, go in and fail. We've seen a lot of well-known Silicon Valley figures over the last 30 years become VCs and just doesn't work for them. Why did it work for you? Yeah, good question. Well, I think part of it was actually over the five years that I was a recruiter, I literally worked with 80 different companies. And I was a retrained recruiter. So I had to like, I've like, strap my body to these companies. And if it sucked and didn't work, I couldn't like get somebody to join them. So I had learned to be very careful about who I took on as a client, which meant I had to understand the market. They had to have a market opportunity that made sense where I could recruit a superstar to join them. And so I learned a lot about what kind of market opportunity makes sense. I watched these companies in various stages of success or disarray. And like, you know, anytime you're recruiting a CEO, there's probably something going on. So I learned a fair amount about what can go right, what can go wrong. And in five years, I saw 80 companies, a venture capitalist doesn't get to do that. VC might invest in, I don't know, two, three, four companies a year. So it takes a lot of years before they can see all that stuff up close. So you weren't just filling job slots. You were actually studying business plans and doing due diligence. I kind of was because I didn't take, I had more business coming at me than I could handle. So I would like try to figure out which was the best one. And what I only worked on three searches at a time. And so, yeah. So part of the reason I was successful was that I had all that perspective. And I guess, I don't know what, I think you have an attitude for it? Maybe. Yeah. Personality makes you a good VC. Good question. I really like digging into people. And I got pretty good at it. And so I like to understand what makes people take and what makes them motivated. And so there's that, the whole side of it. The other side of it is like physics is a dangerous major because you know a little bit about everything. And nobody's too sure what you don't know. And so, I was able to always like figure out if the technology made some kind of sense if it was like doable by human beings and all that kind of stuff. And also I think really good venture capital is a craftsmanship job. And I'm a musician and a painter and that's kind of craftsmanship matters to me. Well we get to the other great question then. The debate has always been, do you invest in the team? Are you a John Doerr school of investing in the team or do you invest in the product? I am hardcore market opportunity investor. So even though I love people and I had a lot of that experience with the recruiting stuff, if you have a great market opportunity you can get great people. And if you have a sucky market opportunity you can't. And so the popular term is pivot these days. I think that's way easier said than done. So thinking y'all well if this doesn't work I can pivot I think is a little bit wacky. So definitely a market opportunity investor. And so of all the companies I did in my venture capital career, I only broke that rule a couple of times. And I should say I only had two failures. We'll come back to that. But one of them interestingly enough was Steve Blank and Rocket Science Games. Those of you who know Steve know this story. And I know Steve's in London right now so I can see this. So Steve used to ask me who's going like so we're fucking up aren't you going to fire me? And I'm like, Steve believe me, I would if I thought it would make any difference. But this market sucks and nothing we can do about it. And you're still friends with him all these years later. Oh God we've known each other for 35 years we were counting it up the other day. So anyway. Well that's kind of unusual. Let's have something about you as well. And about Steve. Yeah well a lot about Steve. We're both so live. Yeah I can't even hold any grudges. Oh no, it was a learning experience for both of us. But anyway, I am a market. Tell me about some of those early companies you invest in. And if you have any anecdotes about that. Yeah. Or I could talk for hours about these. We probably don't want to get too carried away. But like the list is, you may not know all these companies but document them which I invested in the early 90s which is to this day a very much a living product although went public and then got acquired. Interwoven, grand junction networks, applied digital access, primary access to telecom companies. So I did a lot of telecom networking and enterprise software. That was the kind of stuff that was good in my era. And but your ratio was astounding. And I think you attributed to the fact that you never accepted that standard VC ratio of two winners out of ten and four struggle along. It really dare to me when VC say oh yeah, well it's going to be out of ten deals, it's going to be one winner, two or three also ran and the rest are right off. I never played that game, never even thought about it. My idea was that everyone had to be a winner. And so this market opportunity thing, I only went into it if I was convinced that it was going to be a winner. I didn't get it right all the time but and if a company was starting to fail I worked my butt off to not let that happen. Even if I ended up with like two or three times my money, there's a pride thing for me and a life thing for the entrepreneurs whose life was on the line for a few years there. So I just, I'm sure a lot of investors don't think about the lives of the people they're investing in. Well yes, I don't take failure kindly. I could tell one more story if we're not. Yeah, a near death experience. Yeah, a bunch of my companies that turn out very successful had near death experiences. So if you start it people get ready for this, it's like not so easy. So I'll just tell a grand structure network story. So this company made the first 100 megabit ethernet switch back in the early 90s and they were a bunch of guys from three come, incredibly talented guys. And for me the scariest part of any startup is, okay, you're done with the engineering and you just put the product out on the market and they don't be at a path to your doors. Like nobody does anything and it's horrible, which is why Steve Blank does his thing. But we'll come back to that. Anyway, so so we introduced our product, nobody bought it and these guys were three come guys so they were used to indirect distribution channels. So they signed up a bunch of distributors and dealers and stuff like that. So they, those kind of channels can't deal with a completely new technology. This has to be sold direct. And I couldn't convince them of that because they were three come guys. And so I said, okay, here's the deal. We'll do it your way. I can't remember where that was. I said for six months or until we only have 500K in cash left. But I said, I said an endpoint because I knew it wasn't going to work. But I knew this product was going to work in the market. So so they kind of ran out of time. Nobody had bought hardly anything. But in the back when I was recruiting a direct sales force, a bunch of sales reps, there were some good ones available at the time. So when they hit my day, I said, okay, here we go. I've got these five guys. We're going to go sell direct now. They go, okay, but we don't think it'll work. And then it just completely took off. And like quadruple in sales every month and then it got to be like doubling in sales every month until the numbers got huge. And then we had an interesting debate whether to go public or sell to Cisco for a pretty nice price. And that by the way, grand junction networks as well as document and we're both standing for business school cases. I don't know if you guys still study that stuff. So it was the sale to Cisco versus go public that's the case. But the more interesting case to me is what happened in the distribution channels. Anyway, so that company's now worth billions of dollars. And the seed of the whole Ethernet switching business at Cisco came from these guys. And I just saw them. We just had a 20 year reunion and got together out in Colorado and reminisced about all this jazz. And six out of the seven people around the table were pilots, which that's pretty cool. Plus you. Yeah. Yeah. Now you were a pioneer of micro venture capital firms. You coined the records floodgate, Pejomon Mar, engineering capital. Want to tell me about them? Yeah. Are they alike? Are they different? They're pretty different. So yes, I helped Mike Maple start floodgate back in. We dreamed it up in 2007, but I think we raised the money in 2008. And at the time, the whole idea of the craftsmanship in early stage, it was partly the economics that it was now possible to start a company with a lot less money than before. So you didn't need to go raise 10 million bucks right out of the shoot. But the other side was there's a good deal of craftsmanship involved in this. And Mike has that skill set. So we started floodgate in 2008. And he's on his, I think, his fifth fund now. And I'm investor in all his funds. And I still coach those guys pretty often. And then Pejomon Mar, I worked with those guys to get started and help them bring in some investors. And I coached them now and then, and then engineering capital. We just closed today. Ashmeet Sagan is the founder. And they do, Ashmeet's going to do enterprise infrastructure software. So whereas Pejomon Mar does, and floodgate both do a fair amount of consumer stuff as well as enterprise, so kind of a mix. And interestingly enough, both floodgate and Pejomon Mar have, there she is, a woman, each of them has a woman, a partner who is also a PhD in some hard stuff at Stanford, which is amazing. So anyway. Now, was there a moment when I think in every party's career, if they're pursuing a particular direction, there's a moment when they realize they're good at this. That this is what you were destined to do. Did you have that moment? Yeah, I think kind of by, like, I had been in the business maybe three or four years when I started, and my companies were just cooking. Yeah, I was starting to think this is going to work out. And but I knew that, like, a couple of years before the outside world knew that. But then it all happened. Because you know, I mean, once you get the market opportunity right and the execution is right, you can't hardly stop it. Okay, you've said it's not the calls you take, it's the calls you make in life too. Is that your life motto? Well, it's really was. And what does it mean? First of all, it certainly wasn't the venture business. This is my little saying that I love. I don't know if people even make calls anymore. Don't you guys like, tweet stuff like that. But anyway, and what it means is this, when you're out in the real world, both in startup and venture capital, but for sure venture capital, so much stuff is coming out to you. You're just like overwhelmed. You can stay very insanely busy just responding to the stuff that comes to you. And what that saying means to me is don't do that. Make sure that you keep in your mind your agenda, your goals, what matters to you and what kind of moves the state of the art forward and make sure that every week you at least work a little bit on those things that matter to you. And rather than just like deal with all the shit that's coming your way, which is always a lot. And I think in the venture capital context, if you look at most of my really great startups, they weren't guys that called me. I called them. I found them. And that's pretty huge. Yeah, I mean, you talk about the importance of coal calls, but coal calling is like an aesthetical to the engineering personnel. I think. Yeah. And there's always been this dimension of what you talk about of having to do the ugly business side of things. It's not just designing products. It's not just chasing a market. It's actually doing the blocking and tackling of real business all the way through. All right. Yeah, designing products is really fun. And there's hardly anything we can't build in Silicon Valley these days. But like, I don't, you're getting, I don't know if you guys do coal calls, but I used to love it because it's like you get through the secretary and then you get to talk to the guy. It's usually a guy. And you got like 12 seconds to grab his attention. I found the adrenaline of that really interesting. And so, and I sort of, of course, learned that in the recruiting business, but it turns out to be really useful in life, too, you know, like when you're selling stuff. So, yeah, and I don't know. I went through a phase in my early 20s where I was a physicist and I couldn't be bothered with all that other stuff. But, you know, what? Nothing happens if you don't make it happen. So, let's talk about the venture capital industry now because you're still deeply, deeply involved. And you get down and town more often now than you were 10 years ago. That seems like. Yeah. So, how's it changed? Man, well, everything changes in the valley all the time. So, you know, at first there was this thing in the early 2000s where the normal venture firm, economics kind of didn't make so much sense because you could start a lot of really great companies on not very much money. And the angel investors were doing a lot of that. Which is why the micro VCs started. And so, there's this whole bifurcation now of the venture business between micro VCs and the larger firms. But then there's also, there are like the super VCs like Andres and Horowitz huge firms that do a lot of late stage investing and we'll come back to that. And some of the kind of middle-sized firms that were pretty much the model of venture capital in my day. But I think right now the bifurcation is micro VCs and huge firms. Yeah, they talk about the chasm between angel and series A. That for all the money you read about in these gigantic funds, there's hundreds of companies sitting out there right at the edge. They're running out of money from angels and they can't make that jump to series A because it's just hard to do and harder than ever. Well, there's a lot of money out there. You have to have a market opportunity that makes sense. So I think if you can't raise money in this environment, you probably have to ask yourself is your market really all that interesting? Yeah. You also have pointed out that IPOs seem to take a lot longer than they used to. Yeah, man. In my day, in like the 90s and kind of culminating with 2000, you could get a company. My average was kind of between four and seven years of life would be when you could expect an IPO or a liquidity event. That just doesn't happen now. Companies have to be much larger and much more sustainable. And I actually think that's really healthy because I live through the 2000 crash and in a way, individual investors got hurt in that market. At least now, there's a crash now. It's professional investors are going to get hurt. I think that's better. But what's working for the super VCs right now is that companies are required to have much more revenue and much more reality to them before they go public. So all the money that used to be raised in the public market is in fact being invested by the later stage venture capitalists. And I actually think that's a very healthy system. Well, we saw IPOs disappear basically by the end of the first decade of this century. Now they're coming back, but M&A is still awfully strong around here. I mean, I can remember 2000, every business plan had an IPO as a liquidation event. By 2006 or 2007, it was the last line was and then we'll sell to Google. And in 2012, it's then we'll sell to Facebook. How is that ratio swinging these days? Well, true. I think the bar to go public is very high now. I think in my venture capital career, I made more of my selling companies than taking in public. I think it's a great route for liquidity and a great route for the people. And let me tell you, it sucks being on the board of the public company. So there's that. So I think that's very healthy. For you entrepreneur, so I think the trick is to keep enough to tell you know a little more about what the outcome is going to be. Keep your runway clear so that you don't raise too much money that you can't sell at a modest price and be happy. So it's tempting to go raise too much money and then you get in your self into a spot where nobody's happy if you don't sell for $500 million and those kind of deals are rare. So whereas if you can sell for like 80, that could be really nice if you only raised a million bucks. So you got to think about that. And we've been talking about all the changes in venture capital. What's stayed the same? I mean, you have a long history now. You can look at different generations of venture capitalists. Yeah. Well, what's stayed the same for startup people is it's still about the market opportunity. When you raise venture capital, it's really important to get a great venture capital on your board. Somebody who will like kind of live and die the way I did about whether you succeed or not, who not just view you as a transaction, but a part of their life that they're going to make successful. Get that. It's really important for you. And there are guys out there that can do that and women. And so I would say be very particular about who your investors are and it's not always about price. I would any day recommend taking a great venture capitalist at a lower price than some person at ridiculously high price. So get your company funding set. And then later, when things are going well, you can go raise money at crazy prices and get crazy people involved. That's okay. But not until you've built your foundation. You've got a few minutes. Let's dwell down into the process of being a venture capitalist. For example, you talked about the primacy of market opportunity. What does that mean? What do you look for? And I'm going to a great market opportunity. So here's what I always say. I say I'm looking for a target customer with the compelling reason to buy. Now, that seems like a simple thing to say. But it's fraught. Like target customer, I should back up one second. I did only B2B. I didn't do consumer. And we can come back to that. But target customer means a target to bold customer. Like you have to figure out who they are, where they are, how are you going to reach them? You have to have a way to reach them. They have to have certain characteristics. And if you can figure all that out, that will tell you what your sales and marketing strategy needs to be. This is a little bit like what Steve Blink teaches. And the compelling reason to buy is the product needs to be so good or so compelling to them anyway that they'll kind of do anything to get it. Like deal with a lot of bugs, stuff that doesn't work right. Pay you some advance money to continue the development. I've had lots of crazy stories like that. But they have to be really compelling. And compelling usually means a revenue enhancer, not just a cost reduction. Cost reductions are fine. But something that gets them more revenue faster is really compelling. And what if there's a company already in that market, an incumbent company? Yeah, this is something else. Should I keep you out? Yeah. I've got my learned over all these years in the venture business. We always worry about the incumbent, whoever had like a similar product in the market, there was a large company. Man, it's very rare that a startup gets beat by a large company. Mostly they get beat by some other startup down the street who's smarter than they are. So I would spend time looking at my competitors, my startup competitors, not the big companies. They don't have the attitude we do. Looking at over your career, it seems to me you favor B to B over consumer. Why is that? Yeah. So this customer-compelling reason to buy things is it's a rational process. And so you can like go do homework, you can do steep links, lean startup thing, and go talk to a bunch of target customers. And it's fairly logical. Whereas consumer, to me, there's always been like an element of luck in it. And it's like it's great fun when it works, but you know it doesn't work all the time. And I want to do the kind of numbers I did in the venture business, not some random stuff. And so consumer doesn't work with kind of my way of thinking. I think consumer stuff is very cool, but I don't have the guts for it. So sometimes when I come to Stanford I hear people talking about all these consumer ideas and it looks easy, but it's not. So you have to also ask yourself if you're a lucky person I think. I don't think it's for everybody. So I encourage you if you're not so sure you're a lucky person, maybe think about some B to B stuff. Let's talk about the CEO now. How do you find a good CEO? What do you look for? You know, it boils down to pretty simple stuff, but hard to find. I look for a CEO who's a great leader. I was just sitting in the back right now. And also who's the best salesman in the company. If you get that CEO in front of a customer, they're going to buy this stuff. And that doesn't mean that the CEO had to come up through sales. I've had great salesmen who were engineers or marketing people. And so it doesn't kind of matter where they came from, but they have to be a great salesman. And not just to the customers, but also to recruit people into the company to get venture capital to invest. It's really crucial. You've also talked about keeping them aligned. They have a great CEO has to keep everybody going in the same way. Yeah, that's the leadership thing. Because the startups that fail often have like everybody's mad at each other and they're all going off doing in different directions and it's all crazy. It's really important that the whole team is pushing in the same direction, kind of has the same vision. Kind of knows what the plan is, knows who the competitors are. And that comes from leadership. I've also noticed a lot of really good CEOs actually know when to stop people. That startups have a tendency to just keep designing stuff. They keep having really great ideas. And if the CEO doesn't say, okay, we're going to do this one. They never do. They never do. Yeah, that's also a job of a good venture capitalist too. I mean, I say, yeah. Not to bring up Larry Ellison again. But you said he was an interesting leader because he had periods of enormous, almost superhuman intensity and then periods of abdication. What does that mean? We weren't sure what it meant. We used to talk about that. Larry would do his thing. But then every, I don't know, a couple of months. He disappeared for three or four days, maybe a week. And we didn't know where he was. A few people would get emails from him. But I think he was thinking stuff up. So Larry was that rare case of a guy who was pretty incredible on execution, but also kind of had the technology strategy in his head and the business strategy. And so he used to go away and think, I think. And we were never too sure what I was doing. But I know he would come back from these things with all these ideas. Well, the thing you were talking about. He would have like 50 ideas and then we'd all go dump on all those ideas and we'd hone him down. But often he would come back. There was a nugget in there. And so I think that's what he was doing. An interesting case. And I don't think that's sort of a normal, for us at Yale, but what for Larry? Let's talk about life and being a CEO. I'll give you an anecdote of my own. I was interviewed with Scott McNeely from my PBS series. And we got talking. And I asked the question, I said, you've got little kids at home. How do you balance having a family with running a Fortune 100 company? He got this terrified look in his eyes and he said, I can't. I just can't. And the PR person ran onto the set, grabbed him and said, Mr. McNeely has to go and took him off and ended the recording. Because you can't allow the CEO of a company that size to show human weakness, right? Not in the public eye. So you have said if you're trying to find a work life balance as a startup CEO, forget it. I'd say that's right. Yeah, people talk about this balance thing, but I never figured it out. I literally had to start my recruiting firm to have a baby. I couldn't figure it out. That's your capital's way easier than a startup. So I could sort of do that. But you can't do it. I don't think. I do a great job. You can do a social job, but a social job and a startup won't get you killed. I quit playing violin for five years while I was doing startups. That's how bad it was for me. So I think you've got to be ready to really put everything into it. And which reminds me of an anecdote because Martin bronze is sitting in the pack. So one night I used to do my best worrying at night because I didn't have time during the day. And so I was sitting there thinking, trying to sleep, thinking about some, it was some dumb pricing issue or something at interwoven. And I had it all figured out. So I call up Martin's voicemail this is back in the day, a voicemail. I thought I would leave him this big long dump because it was too long to type. So I call him up. It's like 3.30 in the morning. He answers the frickin' phone. And I'm going, what are you doing? He goes, I'm working. What are you doing? We got to talk. And you know, that's the kind of life that, well, venture capital is maybe doing how it's have to live with it, but CEOs do. So don't think too much about balance. What advice do you have for someone starting a company today? And I'll give you the first one, which is you've said, listen to Steve Blank. Yeah. Well, I presume a bunch of you guys have heard Steve Blank's stuff. But the whole thing. No, we're talking about hands. You guys almost Steve Blank, right? Good. Yes. That was a great job. So, so this thing I was saying about the back in the old days, the day you got your product all done and you put it out there in the market, it's the most scary day for me because nobody buys it and then you have to go actually figure out what the hell you're doing. So what Steve has invented is a methodology for kind of figure, get each of that spot way earlier before you spent all the money and built maybe the wrong product. And so take his lean startup thing seriously, figure out what your market is and how it works and who are the target customers and all that stuff, much of which can be done without a complete product. So that's really important. I would say the next thing is to surround yourself with incredible people and be that people in your company as I was talking earlier about your venture capital investors. And I'd encourage all you guys that are starting companies not just to get venture capital, great venture capitalists and great employees, but also to get somebody else on your board than an investor, some outside person who has wonderful industry experience and who might like to share that. I encourage all my companies to have an independent director and that's just been invaluable. So there's a couple of things. How about money? I am money. Well. Yeah. We've talked about raising money from the best venture capitalists you can in the early days and don't worry about getting the best price until later. And this whole thing of keeping your runway clear until you're sure that you're not going to have to sell for $80 million, you don't want to raise too much money. You've said that finding customers is the hardest thing to do right now. And I've seen an awful lot of really good startups on paper. They even have a good prototype of their product, but they can't break through all that noise out there. There is so much noise, especially in the consumer sphere of branding and marketing out there, it seems almost impossible to get enough customers. That's why I don't do consumer deals. Yeah. I mean, I saw Reid Hoffman a couple of months ago and he said, you know, to be frank, if we were trying to start LinkedIn right now, we would fail because we did it when there wasn't a lot of noise out there. Well, yeah. But Marhorshensson is right here in the audience and she has a bunch of consumer deals that are doing incredible. And so how do you rise above the noise? I don't know. You have Mark on my period top. I do think, I mean, of course you have to have great stuff, but that's not, you know, I think there's an element of luck, an element of style. I think it's risky business. How do you get the right, you talked about, you want to get people with experience on your board. How do you get them? I mean, if you go to a venture capital firm these days, a lot of them are so bloated with, you know, people that are younger than you. You know, I mean people, people that are just out of college and they're getting enormous responsibility and there's always that former CEO sitting there somewhere in that firm. How do you get his or her attention? How do you get that expertise, that wisdom? Well, I don't think you get it from a venture capital firm. I mean, occasionally you do, you can find a venture capitalist who had a great operating experience, but even still you want to counterbalance that. So I think you, as a founder of a company, you sort of make a list of the 20 guys you admire most in the business and cold call them or cold test time or whatever. Go make it happen, pick them out. And you know, you'd be surprised. You find somebody who's, I don't know, in their late 30s has had a successful startup, maybe they're still working at it. You'd be surprised how interesting it is for people like that to sit on a board, particularly if they're not on a board. So they don't have to be like professional board sitters. It's great advice for you and it's great counterbalance to the venture capitalists because they're not always right. So it's nice to have a guy who's like independent and good. Before we run out of time, when you look back on your career, what are you proud of stuff? Well, in the venture capital side of it, I'm really proud that I did right by my investors. My investors were all university endowments, foundations and a few pension funds. And so that 90% IARR actually are funds. All the funds I've been active in were returned six to eight times. So huge IARRs for those. So I'm really proud of that for the investors. And I got to have the fun of creating some great companies with some amazing people. And of course, now I'm my do-ditch. So a bunch of those CEOs are like my personal friends and that's a gift. Now it seems to me that you found a balance. If I had asked you 15 years ago, someone said, how's Catherine? Did she have a good life balance? I would say, I don't know if she's always in the office. But now I visualize you at the ranch walking among the grape vines, checking out the crush. And more than that, you became a philanthropist. I mean, at one point, weren't you the world's leading supporter of original class of music? I was. I'm composers. Yeah, I did that for a while. And yeah, but I'm retired now. I have great. Yeah, how many days are you in the valley per week? Seriously, I'm here like every other week, maybe. Okay. You know, I have a company. Are you watching right now? No, zero. Zero? But I'm working with the three micro VCs. Okay. So I visit them. Is that when you find the balance, you find it after your career? I think so. As far as I know. Yeah, so I have a good life on all that right now. What advice do you give to the young women in this audience? Okay, I really want you to address that. You've mentioned the term that you've said it's valuable to be oblivious. Yeah, I really want to know what that means. Okay, so for you women, we kind of skipped over the fact that I was at Merrill Pickard in an old line venture firm and then in the mid-90s started Foundation Capital. And the reason I started Foundation Capital was that I couldn't get a job. And by then, my track record, I was already well on the way to this 90% IRR, had a bunch of great companies. But Merrill Pickard blew up and Andy Rackliffe, some of you may know, and Bruce Dunley who went off to form with some other guys, Benchmark Capital. And I went off eventually to form Foundation Capital. But before I did that, I thought, maybe I'll just go join an existing firm. But I was kind of picky. There were only a large handful of firms that I would have joined. And I went and started talking to those guys, mind you, with this track record. And I spent maybe three months doing that. And it was clear that it was going to take a really long time. And so this is the only time in my career that I feel like I reached a wall because I was a woman. Because if I had been a guy, I am sure that I would have been snapped up really quickly. And so I was like, shit, I'm not going to spend a year doing this. Because I was right in the middle of this, I had all these companies and it was on all these boards, all these companies going public left and right. And I had lots of good things happening. And I didn't want to spend a year kind of looking for a job. So I decided, well, hell, I'll just start a firm. So I started my firm and hooked up with a couple of other people who were loose in the business. And we started the firm. And so I had the money raised in a few months. Now it turns out, it's kind of a sour, grape-sounding thing. But I loved it. I was so glad that I got to start my own firm and do things my way. It was great. And almost all of our investors, our original investors, were investors in my previous firm. So they knew me. And so that part wasn't hard. In fact, endowments and foundations, those kind of entities, a goodly number of the chief investment officers of those companies are women. So raising money was no problem. But there was this weird thing about venture capital and all-male firms. And if you look around the valley even now, there are very few high-level women that have gone into those all-male firms. I think Mary Meeker has done it at Kleinert. But she's amazing. And I can't have a hard time thinking of too many more. So what is oblivious? Oh, oblivious. Oh, yeah. So I sit with Steve. Like a couple of weeks ago going, Steve, I've had this whole woman thing. It's like maybe blown out of proportion because I've had absolutely no problems in my life. It's just been great, except for that one exception. And he says, no, Catherine, the problem with you is you're oblivious. I'm like, oh. And I would say being oblivious is a great strategy for women. Just forget about it. Just plow right through those walls and don't think about it. Because if you sit there and dwell on, oh, God, what you don't, I was, he not listening to me because I'm a woman or because I suck. Better to assume that it's because you suck and you've got to clean it up than to assume that you're a woman because that's just kind of a loser attitude anyway. So be oblivious. It's a good plan. Work for me. What if you discover you suck and you need to clean it up? What do you got to do? You talk of introspection. But you talked about demeanor and manner. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it is important to have, I mean, I think most of you women here get this. You have to have like the right demeanor. You don't want to be having guys flirting with you and stuff. But I really believe that if you carry yourself in the right way, that's not going to happen.
