 Who you are defines how you build. This is Thought Leaders Revisited, a special summer 2020 edition of our entrepreneurial Thought Leaders series. During this summer of uncertainty, we're inviting some of the most influential past ETL speakers to join us for a series of new conversations about innovation, leadership, and especially finding opportunities in the midst of a crisis. On this episode, we're joined by Debbie Sterling. Debbie is the founder and CEO of Goldie Blocks, a children's toy and multimedia company that's working to close the gender gap in engineering through storytelling and female characters. Welcome Debbie. Thank you so much for having me Tina. It's so great to virtually be back on campus. Well, it is such a pleasure for me. I loved, loved, loved your talk and I essentially assign it to lots of students that I work with. It was so powerful that it actually moved me to tears three times during the talk and this is very unusual. The emotion came from the way that you tapped into your entrepreneurial spirit to bring your really big ideas to life and most importantly, how you overcame obstacles along the way turning problems into really big opportunities. Now these are all things that we teach in our classes and so it just was so meaningful to me. So I'd like to start out Debbie by playing a short clip about what you thought was going to happen when you started your venture and compared to what really happened. So let's play the first clip to get sort of a snapshot of how you were feeling when you began. I came up with this plan, right? Like this is my grandmaster plan where we've got this original prototype that I know is just this breakthrough idea and one day I'm going to disrupt the pink aisle in every toy store with this idea. So there wasn't very straightforward path to that as I had thought but in my talk today what I want to share with you all is sort of this sort of circuitous path that I took from having my kind of first prototype in hand to actually getting Goldie blocks onto the shelves of toy stores around the world. In this clip you show a straight line from A to B or A to Z and that was your fantasy and then this totally circuitous random path with lots of working back on itself and tying itself in knots before you finally get to the end. If you had known that that was going to be the path, would you have done it? What would you have done differently if you would actually know? You know that's it's so I love watching that again. I love thinking back to the early days when Goldie blocks was just beginning because I look at that original grandmaster plan and knowing what I know now it's so like beautifully naive and audacious and I think there's like some real like I love the audacity of it right that like as a 27-year-old in my living room you know I so wholeheartedly believed that this idea of an engineering toy for girls should absolutely be on every toy shelf next to Barbie right that like every little girl around the world should have access to engineering toys just as much as she has fashion dolls and so I think that I would if I were to do it over again I would not have done it the same way of what I know now because now I know how difficult math retail is and then talk about COVID which has changed everything and the you know and now so much of the world is moving to e-commerce and how difficult it is to compete in math retail against major household name brands I mean there were all it it makes a ton of sense why there were so many pivots and things along the way because what we were trying to do was so incredibly hard um that um but on the other end I love that that was the goal because in many ways putting down that like really clear audacious goal from the beginning um and the naivete in which we approached it in the early days I resulted in us doing some of the most innovative groundbreaking things that we did that really put the company on the map and that story of disrupting the pink aisle which we did in Toys Arrest and Walmart and Target and and Toy stores around the world I mean we achieved that in record time and I think that that story and the ability that we had to do that really built the brand of Goldie blocks as this rebellious like little engineer that could that everybody fell in love with the brand and the story and that's what really got the company off the ground so you know in some ways I'm glad that it went that way and I'm glad that a lot of my early mentors actually didn't dissuade me from that path and I see myself now mentoring a lot of young people going into it and I I constantly struggle with how much to tell them about how hard it is because I don't want to dissuade them either um and so look I think um I think knowing what I know now um it probably the goal and in the goal now that I talk about it's less about um where the product or content that we create gets distributed you know it doesn't matter if we're selling through mass retail toy shelves or online or in a physical you know or in a mom and pop store it the goal really is to get young girls excited about STEM you know and so and so that's really the goal and when you when you make that the goal then you can think about the best way to achieve that at the stage of the company that you're at so that you're not trying to do something that's impossible but you're more kind of stepping there gradually as the company builds and grows very cool well um I think one of the most fun pieces of your talk initially when you talked about when you first started and you didn't know who you should share your ideas with you know then this is something every entrepreneur feels is that say if I show it to people too early they're going to scoot my ideas as the best idea in the world everyone else is going to steal it or if you show it to early it really doesn't capture the vision of what you're trying to accomplish and so you don't want to show it and get criticism on the other hand if you're going to wait too long then you're going to miss out on the opportunity of getting really helpful feedback and support so I want to play this clip about which I think is just a fabulous clip about how you sort of navigated that path between being private and then learning when you had to share your idea so let's play clip number two I learned that being an inventor means that you sort of hole up alone kind of working on your idea trying to come up with something that's what I've been doing for the last few months I've been kind of alone in my apartment making those sketches and prototypes and even though it was my passion it was what I knew I wanted to do with my life I was lonely we got I wasn't having a lot of fun and I was too afraid to talk to people about my idea because I was afraid that some big toy company might steal it and so I was just I was lonely the moment I went to this social entrepreneurship conference and I built up the courage to get up and share my idea without making somebody sign an NDA which by the way I'd even made my mom sign one I was so paranoid I'm the moment I actually I because I'm not even kidding I have a copy of it the moment I actually finally kind of put myself out there like everything changed all of a sudden I wasn't feeling lonely anymore I had people coming to my apartment every day evenings weekends we were working on the prototypes together they were helping me they were giving me advice they were giving me ideas just volunteering because they were passionate about it I just love that I mean it's just terrific so I wonder what advice would you give other people this is a question get asked all the time you know when do you know when to set to share your ideas with others what what sort of the insights do you have yeah it's it's so funny that was so true I have so many NDAs from my early days and and and that I made people sign because I was so worried and it's so funny nobody was going to steal that idea I mean nobody no big toy company was ever going to try what I was thinking because it was so against all the things that they had learned over the years that work for girls like no one was ever going to try it and look like I think there are tons of ideas out there every day and there's probably a lot of people who had had the idea that I'd had before and the point is like it all just comes down to who's going to put in the time and who's actually going to execute it right and I have really look like I have not yet regretted sharing any of my ideas with anybody period I mean even I've had many meetings now with big other toy companies media companies who could be competitors and I've I've shared proprietary ideas with them as well and um and you know I think worst case scenario they copy it and or they try to copy it or they do it in their way and then there's something out in the world that's beneficial to girls so in my mind that's a win I mean maybe that's a stupid business thing you know maybe that's a stupid thing to say for my business nobody's done that yet really um people have tried to knock us off after we've launched something that will happen with any business but nobody has copied just an idea before it is actually gained traction in the marketplace because everybody's too afraid so my advice is you know now I'm not saying like go and give away some like proprietary algorithm or something that you come up with that's really novel like you don't want to do something like that but if you have you know if you have a big idea or something that you're excited about like I mean I remember reading this book by like Makoski who is the founder of Tom Shoes and I loved this thing that he said where he would wear two different colored shoes like around and and because he wanted to talk about what he was doing with everybody like even a stranger on an airplane and so by wearing two different colored Tom's shoes like everybody would come talk to him about and then he could talk about his idea and it's so true like I was starting to talk about Goldie Blockser I'd have some of my prototype pieces that I'd be holding or I'd have a draft of book that I was working on and literally in in the early days I mean waiters at restaurants I would talk to about it and they would be like oh like my aunt is a writer at the Atlantic like I'll hook you up with her and I'm like really and they're like yeah like I'm not I'm not exaggerating like talking to when you're genuinely passionate about something and you start sharing that and talking to people it's amazing it's like this interesting exploration to human nature of people want to help they almost like they want to show off like who they know right and how they could be helpful to you and so I think that a lot of my early wins came from just sharing sharing the ideas around with everybody who would listen and I couldn't believe how many people would just open up their role at X's like I mean people would give me amazing connections and and I I don't think it's ever really too early to start sharing even some rough idea or a sketch on paper I really don't I have a not yet had an experience where a half baked idea of mine got stolen by somebody else who executed any better than I would have you know I couldn't agree more it is so much more likely that someone's going to help you that they're going to steal your idea and I just it's wonderful that you discovered that that's so early and we're able to really tap into your network of friends to help you really early on and in fact you did some such creative and bold things early on that allowed you to really reach escape velocity one of the most inspiring is of course as you were a small startup and you've heard that there was a way to get a super bowl ad and how you set that as your goal I'm I'm going to play this clip about how you ended up getting a super bowl ad and maybe you can add some more color commentary afterwards and tell us a little bit more about that so we'll play the third clip about your scrappy advertising even though we're this teeny tiny team only five people like how do we get the word out and we found out about a contest being run by into it where one small business had the chance to win a free super bowl commercial so I'm like okay there's our national TV advertising we got to win this and so again it sounds crazy like how could we win a super bowl commercial but we just put it on the wall and we said this is our goal and our team of five people every single day tried to get creative of how are we going to win this and so we emailed our Kickstarter backers we emailed our fans just begged every day vote for us vote for us vote for us and sure enough out of 30,000 small businesses who applied Goli blocks was the grand prize winner and so we had a commercial in the super bowl incredible I mean really really incredible so how did you design the the commercial and how did that work I mean but once you then said like okay we have an ad in the super bowl what does that add look like what did you do so it's so funny because the voting period for the super bowl commercial contest was right around the holidays of 2013 and separately from us applying to be to win this super bowl ad we had also been working on our own commercial that we were going to launch of course we couldn't afford to put it on TV so we were just going to buy commercial I mean YouTube video that we were making ourselves to try to drum up excitement about Goldie blocks over the holidays and so our team you know we really wanted to make a viral video and and we basically you know we put a ton like we didn't have a lot of resources at the time but we sort of like put all of our chips toward this viral video and the concept that we had was making a giant root goldberg machine out of stereotypical princess toys and and we kind of just put all of our focus on that to try to make like the best piece of content we possibly could that we thought would be so epic and would hopefully go viral and these things like you could never guarantee viral but I think we just made an incredible piece of content and it actually did go very viral and it actually resulted in a lawsuit with the Beastie Boys which not lawsuit and of itself went very viral all during this voting window of the super bowl campaign and so I think part of the a big part of the reason why we won was because the company was so well known and talked about because of this viral video that we did so much so and Tina I think a lot of people looking back think that that commercial that we made with the root goldberg machine was the super bowl commercial because it's what everyone remembers um but the actual super bowl commercial was now I'm gonna sound horrible for complaining about a free super bowl commercial like I can't complete like who could ever complain about it but my team was so excited we thought that we would get to make our own super bowl commercial because we had made such we had made such viral videos that I mean we've practically pulled an all-nighter brainstorming all of our ideas for our super bowl commercial and um low and behold um the into it and the ad agency that they were working with had long before had been planning of course they were going to make the super bowl commercial with our input but um they had already planned out the super bowl commercial even before we knew we had one so um the super bowl commercial that we got we worked in partnership with into its ad agency and it was cool it was cool it was like a um a bunch of girls running through the streets building a big rocket ship out of their princess toys and shipping it off into space and it was super cool and um it it um it was really unique for the super bowl because super bowl usually is like you know beer and chips commercials so it was like very standout and certainly like a rally cry for girls and girl empowerment during the super bowl which you almost never see um so it was awesome I just like I always I always wish we could have made our own super bowl commercial so now maybe someday we will maybe there's still time there's still time so I'm I'm really curious uh the you were super scrappy because you didn't have anything but once you started getting money and you had resources was it able to rewable to stay so scrappy I know that's often a challenge you know when you don't have anything you don't have another choice but when you do have resources you know there's a tendency maybe to spend more than you need how how do you think about that and how to do approach it well you know I think for us um being scrappy was never like staying scrappy was never the problem we did get a lot more resources our problem was we were trying to do too many things with too few resources so we always um in the early days we really just had a focus problem because um the vision for Goldie Blacks was so big you know it was not just I want to have toys it was like I want to have toys and a TV show and a feature film and mobile apps and I want you know uh eventually I want to have um stores and you know it was just I wanted it to be a global franchise as big as you know Barbie and Disney Princess and American Girl and um in the early days we were just trying to do so much so um what ended up happening was we had like what what we should have done which is um you know hindsight 2020 but like what we really should have done was sequence it out a little bit better so that you know we really nail one thing first and then once that sort of that part of the business is stable and up and running and profitable then we layer on the next thing and then we layer on the next thing but instead we had like five projects at a time all of which were under-resourced so we always stay we always stay and release scrappy and what's kind of amazing about it and what I've learned though through this is um you know for for example um we decided we wanted to launch a mobile app which could have been its own company in and of itself right and for us it was just sort of like an add-on we wanted to have an we wanted to get into the apps business and so um we had this tiny scrappy team and we literally had like a friend of ours um uh from Seattle who we knew could make apps and he like moved into my husband and my apartment and like lived and slept on our living room couch for two months all pulling all nighters working with a team in Poland to make the app you know was like insane and um but it ended up winning iOS iOS app of the year and I was on stage doing a keynote at WWDC so like it's like I think what I've learned here one like yes like properly resource the projects that you do and kind of sequence things out so you're not doing too much because that's like what every startup messes up on and ours was very much so um but on the other hand I have learned that keeping it scrappy can be a really good thing because I've had other examples of projects where you would think like okay well we have a bunch of resources now we have more money so you start growing the team and putting more people on it and then all of a sudden all of these people bog it down and um and I've found that and we do this now when we're working on a project like even my my toy team is very small like my internal toy team is very very so like amazingly small you wouldn't believe but we could we bring in contractors and new ideas and thinking but the in-house team is very small and that enables us to move really quickly really cool well sometimes you know things don't of even in that situation you know they end up going the wrong direction there's a story you told that was I think probably the most powerful story I have heard in all of the ETL history and I I'm not being hyperbolic it's the one that you talk about in this next clip and it's where you basically shipped all of these toys and then there was a problem and the blocks weren't fitting together the like so you got all this attention you built this market and this buzz and this audience and these customers and then the product didn't work and the way that you handled it not only was clever it was brilliant I mean you this was such an example of turning a problem into an opportunity so I'm going to play this clip and then I want I'm you to tell us about how you shifted your mindset from like oh no like this company's going out of business this is a total disaster how did you switch that to okay how do we turn this into success so let's play this clip and then get your reflections we started getting complaints in that the blocks were not fitting right a little bit too loose and I was just so upset I could barely handle it so we thought okay what would we do what would an engineer do when you have this big hairy problem let's let's break it down into simple and manageable steps right so what do we need to do so first we need to fix the block hole okay can we do that great we know how to fix it now we you know we've been able to manufacture better blocks the problem is solved but now how do we go back and tell all those people like hey everybody we fix the problem and you should trust Goldiblock's again let's try building again and so yeah I made a pretty major executive decision and we were a small startup at the time without a lot of resources but I thought there's no better way to deploy our resources than going back to all of those customers telling them that we fixed our blocks and giving them new ones and so we did a huge campaign we're reached out to everybody to tell them about our new blocks film the video myself kind of being vulnerable and talking about the mistake that we made but what we were doing to fix it and we also actually wrote a letter from Goldie to each kid which we had personalized with their name talking about how engineers don't always get it right the first time but that doesn't mean that you give up it means that you keep going you keep iterating and you make it better I love that the idea basically saying we are modeling for you that you were how to recover from a mistake I thought it was brilliant so how did you get into that mindset and how long did that take so I think you know I think a part of it I got into the mindset because it was sort of like I remember even before I started the company I mean before I quit my job and really jumped in I was weighing like the pros and cons of even doing this at all right and my biggest fear other than like oh what if I fail the company goes out of business or something and even bigger fear that I had it's like what if I launch this product and people don't think it's good and then you know and it frustrates like girls and then it makes them not want to mention hearing like what if that like that was probably my worst nightmare like that and so I was living my worst nightmare when this happened and so the headspace that I was in was okay this this is like fixing this or getting this right or recovering from this is literally our top priority and and thank God we raised a bunch of money because we can afford to go and fix this which we may not have been in that situation because we had to spend a lot of money um manufacturing over a million blocks and and doing these big outreach campaigns to try to get a hold of everybody and and ship them blocks and we went I mean just the effort that we took to even get people to submit that they wanted it and get their actual kids name so that we could personalize letters to their kids I was like I what I look back on that now I'm like oh my god I can't believe we did that um and three years later I'm like I'm really proud of it I'm really proud that we did that I don't think a lot of companies would think to go to that level of detail and care I know I certainly haven't had you know any companies kind of treat me that way and I think it was I think it came from this real genuine place of like oh my god I'm living my worst fear how how do you recover from that the only way to do it is to do it with this much thought and care really amazing I mean I I can't even believe it I think it's such a wonderful example now I want to turn to questions that we have from the students they have a lot of them first of all one of the students basically wanted to say that you have are an incredible inspiration and literally just thank you thank you thank you so you're getting thank you notes even in the Q&A there are a bunch of questions about patents and intellectual property let me read a few of them so you can maybe answer them together I've been warned about blocking patents from Fortune 500 companies did you use design patents there are other ones about were those some of the obstacles you faced and getting a patent can you talk about that did you have any intellectual property so we have you know there are a lot of people who are curious about that yeah one of the reasons why I raised a seed round before I launched my Kickstarter campaign is I wanted to initiate the patent process because once I went live on Kickstarter that was kind of open to the world and anybody could copy it so I did right away pursue patents on my construction toys because there were a bunch of novel things going on design-wise and those design patents as well as functionality patents and I do have now a few quite a few patents on those construction toys which is pretty cool because we need more women getting patents and and that process I'm not going to lie like it's expensive and you need a good well-priced patent attorney to work with and but it's important and they can really be worth a lot and and have a lot of value depending on what type of company you're building so it's important to do and and that's one of you know when you're starting a company in the early days probably a big allocation of capital is shoring that step up the other types of intellectual property that we had to pursue in the early days were around trademarks for the company name and trademarking certain things as well as I think really the big one was trademarking the name Goldie Blocks and we knew that we wanted to build a multimedia company that had toys but also clothes and apps and entertainment and we knew we wanted it to be global so that starts just adding up it's really expensive but it's also super important so I think one of the things that we did early on because initially we had like a pretty high priced law firm a corporate law firm that was handling everything but they're really expensive when it comes to like trademark and patent stuff so we were able to find the more affordable law firm for those specific things which I just highly recommend because it's just it's very very costly but there's also things that you can do if you can't afford it you know I think just making sure you're not infringing on somebody else's patent or trademark I think is good it is something you really want to do if you can't afford yet to go through all of those steps at least knowing that you're not infringing on somebody else's like we launched something once where we did like a cursory search and we did find someone else who's using the name but we were like oh this is some no nothing whatever we're not worried about it and they came back and they were like the most unreasonable party ever and we ended up like wasting a ton of legal time and money having to like navigate that so being careful about not like it's free you can go to us pto.gov and for free you can go and look and see who's covered where and what and what's existing so you don't have to pay legal bills for that and as long as you're not infringing on what somebody else already owns and you start picking whether it's the name of your company or whatever your product is if you begin demonstrating the use of that even if you can't afford the expense of legal bills yet that still is actually pretty good protection and then the last thing I'll say is like copywriting is cheap and copywriting is like pretty self-serve so so that's something that that we did as well like all of our books that we published and that sort of thing we copyrighted everything that only cost a cart like a couple hundred bucks or something to do that so it's interesting it reminds me of the discussion I had with Kevin's system about starting Instagram and he talked about the fact that running a company is only a small fraction dealing with the product there's all the other things that I have to do with keeping the company going and this is a perfect example the intellectual property strategy and implementation is really important so we've got a whole bunch of new questions here one that a bunch of people are interested in is about your kickstarter campaign you were super successful to begin and can you talk about that and how you were able to make that so successful early on well I think for Goldie Block specifically the kickstarter campaign was all about my ability to deliver a very effective video speaking to camera from the heart about what I was doing and why and really making the ask like asking everybody you know if you believe your daughter is more than just a princess then please support me you know by this toy buy it for your daughter buy it for your friend's daughter and you know and really like you know pitching the sale you know and and that is how it's hard to do that you know it's I'm now like pretty media trained and I can speak on camera back then I was you know super awkward and nervous about talking to the camera with all these lights on my in my face like trying to deliver an authentic you know what I was trying to do was how do I replicate when I go sit with someone for a cup of coffee and I tell them what I'm doing my passion just exudes out of me and by the end of the coffee they're like oh my god I'm so excited how do I get involved and that's what I was trying to do with the kickstarter and after several attempts and the funny story there is like we had our first attempt which was very staged and scripted and like it was just trash like I had to throw it out because it wasn't genuine and so we had to completely reshoot the whole thing and I had to drink almost an entire bottle of wine to get comfortable enough to give that performance but I really think that that was what did it on the kickstarter really do it was because it's not like the product prototype was that great I mean it was very beta it was a good it was fine but it was more it was the big idea and Asian you were selling the vision it was the vision that really struck a chord and kickstarter was the perfect platform to do that because it basically enables you to create an infomercial and you can't do that if you're just like a package on a shelf I mean you know so so I really I mean I don't know what would have kickstarter really did kickstart us because the story needed to be told you know if we had just made the toy and got it on some toy shelves nobody would have understood it so I'm just I'm a huge fan of it anytime any entrepreneur asks me whether or not they should do it or they're thinking about it I'm like do it you know because I think it even just crafting what that video would be whether you launch it or not it's such a useful sales tool and useful for you to really figure out how to communicate your vision in a way that would get people you know on board wanting to wanting to want to back it wanting to support it wanting to be a part of it and and the other thing I'll say about whether it's kickstarter or go fund me or any of those other sites it's really cool now I mean you have we have the ability nowadays to sort of crowd fund ideas crowd fund companies and when you have that like we had over 5,000 kickstarter backers who and they still I mean I meet people all the time I meet people whether I'm at a conference or an event that are like oh my god I back to you on kickstarter like they feel like they part own the company and that's so cool to have people like that I mean those were the people that voted for us to win the Super Bowl commercial those were the people that you know showed up when we asked when we needed help on a photo shoot and we needed kids but we didn't have any money you know so I highly recommend it it was a great experience so it's also it's just wonderful because you can do it even before you have a product to just give whether there's any interest right it's a great way to sort of test put up a trial balloon and see if people show up so there's a lot of interest in in this next question which is about you have been in inspiration in closing the gender gap in STEM and also you've done a great job with racial representation and you've really worked very hard at at all of this what can companies and organizations learn from your leadership having to do with diversity and inclusion oh that's a great question um well a couple I think a couple things so from from a uh first I'll speak to a um product perspective um very early on I think we recognized the need to have um really strong representation in our content and in our toys and how important that is for kids and um and we really made that a priority um and it immediately I mean immediately we saw the effect like we um very early on introduced Goldies best friend Ruby Rails who's an African-American coder and right away I mean like we started seeing little black girls posting pictures playing with our toys and prior to that it had been almost all little white girls I mean it was that simple um but then it's also incredibly important um to prioritize diversity for the team itself in the company and um I'll tell you like it's um it's something that has to be a priority um and you have to have the executive leadership team on board I think the biggest thing that we did um to increase diversity at the company is anytime we hire any role um we always need to have at least three final candidates for that role and um there need to be diverse candidates for every role that we hire ever and if the hiring manager can't bring diverse candidates for a role then they need to keep looking because all you know we have to have to have diverse talent um at that final level before the company makes the decision of who to hire and for me I think that's like the biggest thing that we've done a lot we've done a ton of things I mean and I don't have time right now to list all of the things um that we've done in terms of like bringing in people to come talk to the team and this and that and like you know investing in organizations but I don't want to underplay that all of that stuff is important but the most important thing is hiring people of color you know hiring hiring um men and women actually creating a very diverse team with different backgrounds I mean that's that's the way to do it and there's no like sugar coating you're talking around that and um and in order to do it you just you need to prioritize it and there's so many excuses that companies make especially tech companies talking about how you know oh well the the candidates just aren't there there's and and I just you know it's just not true it just takes longer and when you're uh it just takes longer to go find that talent and sometimes it might take a little bit of a leap of faith in bringing in somebody and and providing a little bit of mentorship or getting set they're believing that somebody has like nine out of the 10 things that you need then they can probably you know learn the the one thing that they would need to be successful so you just you have to prioritize it so um that is really inspiring and the fact that you've been thinking about this for a long time is is really really meaningful so what what is Goldie Box up to now what are you what are you doing and what's your vision for the next five years so um well we moved the company to Los Angeles which was a huge move but um we really wanted to be in the epicenter of media and entertainment because you know in addition to the great toys that we create where kids can kind of have hands-on stem learning what's just as important if not even frankly more important is that they need to see characters and role models and stem in in the media that they consume to get them interested in the first place so if you think about um you know Bob the builder handymane Bill Nye the science guy said the science kid lego man I mean the list goes on and on of all of these male engineer characters and um it's really long overdue that we see female inventor builder maker coder characters in children's media and the um the characters in children's media and the toys and the play pattern they really go hand in hand so um so now our company is based in LA um we have our own production studio where we produce our own kids content um we're pretty closely partnered now with youtube and um specifically youtube kids which you know is frankly where more kids are watching content than even traditional tv and um we're we're building out all kinds of shows and um different types of entertainment for kids on top of our toy business and then the other interesting part of our business is we partner with um companies who share our mission so there are a lot of big companies whether it's Nike or um i'm trying to think of our Sony pictures or chevron i mean you name it it's almost every major company has um a corporate social responsibility around either stem education or girl empowerment and so um we've found a really exciting opportunity to partner with those companies on mission driven marketing um as well as creating content to hit the social mission that we both have um bring revenue to gold e-blocks and just expand our reach so um the corporate our corporate partnerships business has been now maybe 18 months in the making so it's fairly new but it's been really exciting and just like one quick example of that that's pretty cool we recently partnered with Nike where we sent a young girl to their headquarters to meet all the women who designed the Nike shoe so it's just like it's pretty fun because it's like Nike gets to market their new shoe we got a great piece of content um you know everybody wins so um we're continuing to build toward that big you know audacious if the if our first goal was disrupt every toy store i would say our new goal is really um getting every you know getting every girl around the world excited about stem and um and that um is audacious enough that's going to keep me up at night for easily the next five to ten years to keep keep on building this and hopefully if we continue um and it feels like i'm at the point now where i'm eight years in and it's fun to to do this talk today looking back three years ago and just feeling like wow i've learned so much you know and i'm still learning um and as long as you just keep on learning and being really open minded about that you know you can just continue to improve and you know eventually eventually achieve what you set out to achieve or realize what you would initially set out to achieve was actually the wrong goalpost but that's okay and
