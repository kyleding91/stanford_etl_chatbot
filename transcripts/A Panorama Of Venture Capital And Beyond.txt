 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Mark Andreessen is a pioneer of a software category that is in use by more than a billion people. What is that category? Browser. How many of you started with an escape browser? Learned to love it? And those of you who didn't, it was a beautiful, beautiful thing that Mark created. In addition, he is one of the very rare individuals who have actually created two billion dollar companies in terms of market cap. Now, Sarah Lacey has written a book called, Once You're Lucky Twice You're Good that goes into a little bit of the story of Mark and a few other people who have done this, if you're curious about it, you can read about it there. But another little on fact is that this is Mark's second visit to ETL. On April 7th of 2000, Mark Andreessen was here. Well, actually, he was in term and he was happy to be reminded of that. He may or may not go into why that is important to him in terms of family matters at home. But, Mark, we're thrilled that you're back at Stanford and let's give him a warm round of applause. So, I just checked online. April 7th, 2000, I was the speaker who was closest to the exact top of the NASDAQ. And so, last time you had me, it was perfect timing of a market top. Absolutely perfect. I don't know what that means about what's happening right now. But, ten years from now, we'll look back and we'll say, aha. So anyway, I just wanted to basically, I don't have anything prepared, so I just wanted to basically launch straight into Q&A. Just a sort of background for people who might not have caught up with what I'm doing. My most recent thing is I started a new venture capital firm with several friends and colleagues last summer. Actually we have four of my friends and colleagues from the firm who are here somewhere in the crowd. Over there, there we go. There's the contingent. And so, later on, if you want to talk to any of these folks, so Ronnie runs all of our partnership and networking efforts. Fred is our new analyst. This is week number one, for Fred. And then, Dave and Ellen work on our recruiting. We actually run an in-house, essentially recruiting function for our startup companies. And so, they work on that. Sorry? Oh, okay, great. Got it. Yep. And so, we would be delighted, obviously, I'd be delighted to talk to folks afterwards, but we'd be delighted to talk to you. So we started an venture capital firm last summer. Actually, another story of timing. We raised that venture capital firm in starting in March of last year, March of 2009, which was the exact low of the economic crisis, the credit crisis. So there's something in what we do that we hit, either the highs of the lows. I don't exactly know what it is, but we raised the $300 million fund last summer opened up. We've been in business for about nine months now. We do Silicon Valley tech investing. Our biggest deal so far is Skype, although we've backed a whole series of other interesting companies. And then, boards that I'm on at the moment include Facebook, eBay, and Hewlett Packard. And then, I continue to be very involved in my company Ning, which is a social networking company here locally. And so, which is sort of that as a general background. Let me just throw it open for questions and see what people want to talk about. Yeah. Hey, Mark. Question for you on moving from being an entrepreneur to venture capital. I'm going to be doing a similar thing. I'm wondering what your perspective is in working with venture capitalists who don't have any entrepreneurial background, which unfortunately represents a large chunk. How do you deal with board conflict in advising folks in that scenario? Okay. So, the question is, as an entrepreneur, turn venture capitalists myself, how do you work with other venture capitalists who may not have entrepreneurial experience, or in some cases, operating experience? Yeah. Well, we like to observe that in California, you need a license to drive a car or buy a gun. But not to be a venture capitalist. And so, it is true that issues arise. And if you talk to a cross-section of entrepreneurs, you'll get various stories in terms of their directors who may not have a depoprational background as some of the issues that arise. So, let me just give a few general thoughts without naming names. So, first of all, I would say that if you look at the folks who are the best venture capitalists over time, some of them have very depopriting backgrounds and have been entrepreneurs themselves. And actually, some of them have not. So, some of the very best venture capitalists, as an example, might more, had a background as a journalist before he became a VC. John Doerr had a background, had worked at engineering and sales at Intel. And a Monsanto before that, actually, Monsanto had a chip business back in the early 80s. And so, he had experience in business, but had not himself started a company. Actually, interestingly, Tom Perkins had, the actual original, one of the original co-founders of Clendir Perkins, but John had not. And then, contrast, of course, the node-coast love had been himself a very successful entrepreneur as another example. And then, down by all the time, another great VC had been a very experienced operator in the chip business. So, you get this very interesting cross-section of sort of success cases. And so, one of the things I try to do is not kind of say up front, I don't think there's necessarily a predictor that just because somebody has an operating background or has been an entrepreneur, that they're going to be a good VC or conversely, that if you don't, you're not going to be a good VC. That said, part of the reason we became venture capitalists, my business partner Ben Horowitz and I became venture capitalists after starting running companies ourselves, was because we think it can be quite helpful and additive to a startup when their investors and board members have actually done it before and have actually been through the experiences. And, of course, we go on to say that this is completely irrelevant in the case where your company just instantaneously succeeds and everything is up into the right and everything is glorious. Then anybody can be a good board member. It's when the times get tough and things get difficult. It helps a lot to have been through a layoff or a restructuring or a forced sale or a recap. All the other things you restart and all the other things you end up going through is not to be an error. And so, I do think that's helpful and important. The characteristic of the venture capital industry right now is that we're on the sort of fourth or fifth generation of VCs in some of the older firms. And so, there are certainly plenty of VCs who have finance backgrounds as contrasted to operating backgrounds or as contrasted to entrepreneurial backgrounds. And so, I think there's a real opportunity for, I mean, speaking, sort of talking my own book as I say on Wall Street, I think there's a real opportunity for VCs who have an operating and entrepreneurial background to add a lot of value in these companies. And so, we spend time basically, you know, when we go into a situation with the other investors who are already in trying to understand, do they have that background? If not, how are they, you know, when they get into the thing? So I think it's helpful. The flip side of, I would say though, the danger, and we got a talking to from all of our friends, investor capital, before we became VCs, and they were very rigorous with us in this point, so I think I'll repeat it as the danger of an operator who becomes a VCs is that he continues to want to be an operator. And so, then he tries to operate the companies that he's in from the board. And of course, that's lethal, like that's just a prescription for disaster. And so, the best professional investors we've found over the years are very good at understanding what's going on and they're very good at helping, but they have a remove from the day-to-day operations because the minute they don't and the minute they get to hands-on, things start to go seriously wrong, it really is impossible to run these companies from the board. And so, we as VCs are going to try to live up to that. Yes? So, the question is on sort of the hotness right now of the application market, especially on platforms like iPhone and Android, and there's a tremendous amount of investment going into companies building applications on these new platforms like iPhone and Android. So we have maybe a little bit of a contrarian point of view on sort of the general sort of assumption behind the question, if you will. The reason I'm also asking you is that it seems like how much revenue can that actually be generated? It seems like that's a minute. So the question is how much revenue can an app actually generate? So our answer to this kind of thing is always it depends, which is my favorite answer of all time. I can always start answering it depends, and then talk for half an hour. People think I've said something. So, it really depends. So it's a little bit like the early days. To us, it looks a little bit like the early days of the PC industry where, you know, in the early days of the PC industry, you would open up a magazine like PC magazine, and there would be ads for thousands and thousands of different software applications, you know, doing all kinds of different things, games, and learning tools, and typing instructors and file your recipes and all this stuff. Most of the companies that produce those applications are long gone, because those weren't significant categories. You couldn't build a real business around them. On the other hand, you had companies like Microsoft and Lotus and Adobe and others that were building applications like Photoshop or Lotus123 or Microsoft Word that turned it to empires. So I really think on this kind of thing that the answer is it depends. And so in a nutshell, we wouldn't invest in an app company because it's an app company, but we also wouldn't avoid it because it's an app company. We would look very carefully at the specific thing of what it does. And by the way, let me generalize out and say, that's the same answer I give to almost any question involving a particular category. So people say, well, location-based services are really hot. You know, what are you doing there? Or people say, e-commerce is hot again, like with all these new group buying services. What are you going to invest there? And our answer is we are going to do absolutely nothing in the category, because the worst thing you can do is go into a category and just like try to find something to invest in, because if the good ones are already taken, then you invest in the bad one. And if you lose all your money, it's like it's a bad formula. And there are DCs who do that. And we don't recommend it. So on the other hand, if we get the opportunity to invest in a very special company with a special founding team and product idea and market position and strategy, then we'll do that in almost any category. In fact, one of our favorite things to do is actually invest in categories that other people believe to be dead. And so for example, we're very excited about investing in enterprise software. People say, well, that's ridiculous. Enterprise software is dead. But nobody can do that anymore. And it turns out, between 2002 and 2008, this sort of most recent period where these things are measured, the top performing sector in all of the venture capital is enterprise software. Precisely because everybody thought it was dead. And so the companies that got funded had practically no competition. And the people who made the investments actually could invest very cheap, because very few people wanted to fund those companies. So we're absolutely delighted to go into sectors that are people who are dead. And we're also happy to go into sectors that are brand new as long as there's a specific company with something magical happening. Yes. I'm just curious for your experience, what sort of criterion you use when you started to actually start a business and we got some of you have a lot of ideas that your someone has different ideas? And what would you, what criteria would you say, okay, this I'm going to pursue, is it those are this I'm not going to pursue? So the general criteria for a successful high tech startup, in my view, there's, you see different sort of rules of thumb from different people. But the three big things you always come back to are, is there a big market? And by the way, that comes in two parts. Is there a big existing market that you think you can go after and sort of displace incumbents or is it, or do you believe there will be a new market that will be big? So a big market. Is there a fundamental technology or economic change that causes you to basically justify having a new company? And that's really important. So you know, and the way I always think about that is, is there a 10X change happening in a technology landscape? Is something 10X faster or 10X cheaper or 10X better? And if it's not 10X, we, we, we viewers both these seasoned entrepreneurs that really have to ask ourselves, like, is it really worth doing? Because it's really hard. It's hard to start new companies, take time and macro theory. New companies generally shouldn't exist. Existing companies are usually pretty good at what they do. And so for a new company to exist, it not only has to, like, you know, come into, you know, go into business and bring a product market, but it has to bring a product market that's so much better than what already exists that it punches through this sort of status quote. And, you know, most customers in most markets are pretty happy buying from the current suppliers. And so there has to be a real kind of edge on the thing. And we look for that in either a technology change, usually technology change or an economic change, which are often the same thing. And then the third is team, is the team outstanding. And if you think about this as an entrepreneur, it becomes a question of the founding team. You know, if, you know, some companies are solo founders and they can work, but generally, you know, most of us, like myself, we're human beings, we're mortal. You know, you want to have a founding team of multi, of complimentary skill sets. And so you want to have at least one super strong technologist, quite possibly more than one. Some of the best start-ups are actually more than one founding technologist. And then it often helps to have somebody who's like a product or who's a market or sales person or has a sort of really good understanding of business on the team, certainly helps a lot. And so we sort of like a market product and team. And you know, the reality is you need all three. I would say interestingly, if you're going to compromise as an investor, if we're going to compromise on one of those, it would actually be the product. And the reason I say that is because a great market is a lot easier to make up for with the iterative product execution than a poor market. Because the problem with the poor market, a small market is even if you do a great job in the product, they're just aren't that many customers. It's hard to ever get big. People get demoralized. So, you know, we definitely focus a lot on the size of the market. And then also the team. And we actually evaluate the team in a startup based on its ability to get into a big market with a good product. And so one of the things we look for early on as VCs is we don't need the team that's going to run the company when it's 500 people and 100 million revenue. Like that's irrelevant. We need the people who can get the product to market in a big market. And if they're wrong, keep adjusting to get into the right market. So that's the general template. And that's how we always thought about it as entrepreneurs. There is however one other thing we look at that I think is really fundamental and important. And it took a while to figure this one out. And I think it's really interesting. So we sort of categorized. So given all that, then you look at companies and you say, okay, here's a high quality set of companies. And then we divide them sort of into two buckets. And we basically say there are products that become companies. And then there are companies that come up with a product. And one of the interesting things you see over the years is that many of the most successful technology franchises were products first way before they ever became companies. And so just in my own experience, Netscape was a research project. It was based on a research project at University of Illinois that we had worked on for three years prior. In fact, the team had come together at Illinois before we started Netscape. Microsoft, Bill Gates, and Paul Allen were like deep into PCs early on before they even thought there was a software business. And then Apple, you know, Jobs and Wise, me I built the first Apple sort of as hobbyists. More recently, Mark Zuckerberg had Facebook running out of his dorm room, you know, way before he ever thought of starting a company. And then my other favorite example is Twitter. Twitter was a side project at a company called Odio. And Odio wasn't working. Twitter was a couple of guys who were basically new that the Odio product, which was a podcasting product, was going to fail. And so they were frustrated and unhappy. And so they started the side project Twitter and it just started to take off. And so the product that becomes a company is a really good template because, and here's my sort of theory on that, it's because it's a demonstration that the product has to exist. Like the market needs the product so badly that somebody actually built it and deployed it and you can actually see evidence that people want it even before there was an economic motivation to do so. Like that's market demands. Like that's something magical is going on there at that point. In contrast, great entrepreneurs who kind of, you know, the sort of stereotypical, well, fuel it Packard. Packard, counter example, company event product. The original found HBR archives put on line a while ago. They put the original minutes of the first HB board meeting. And they're great minutes because it's like, you know, it's, you know, Mr. Hill at Mr. Packard. Maybe this is like in the 30s, right? So these guys are really young at the time. And it's like they're a lawyer and they're accountant, whatever. And it's like, you know, assembled and such and such and Palo Alto at 248 PM and boom, you know, first sort of business cash company has $3,000, whatever the check-in account. And it's like topic number six product. And it was, one line, I said, the product that the company will build has not yet been decided. Period. Topic number seven. Right? Like they didn't know. Like they didn't know. They had like a general idea that there was going to be something to do with electoral mechanical, something, something, something. I mean, this is before the computer, but earlier before the computer when they started this thing, right? So they didn't know what it was going to be. And they came up with many good ideas later, but they didn't know. So that's a success case of company first then product. But we see a lot of failure cases, which is smart entrepreneurs sitting around saying they really want to start a company. And now let's go try to figure out something interesting and good to do. And it's very easy in that process we found to kind of fool yourself into believing that there's a market and then there's a need. Because you want to find something. You have a very strong motivation, internal motivation to come out with an answer. It's very hard to go through that process for three months and then say, you know, what we can't come up with any good ideas. You know, let's just go back to our day jobs. So yeah, it's a big company of your choice. And so it's a very strong motivation to kind of fool yourself. And so that, we're always a little bit lary of those. And in fact, if you track those kind of through funder, like those are often the ones that aren't actually ever able to raise money. Because the VCs can kind of, you know, VCs are good at this kind of thing. They can kind of smell that kind of thing coming. So moral of the story is it has to be, it has to be, it has to be a really good idea. That often will be an idea that it's pre-existing at the time you decide to start a company. And if it isn't, be really careful because you're kind of, you know, you're walking on sharp rocks at that point with a high risk of falling off the cliff into the ocean. It's a particular dangerous scenario to be very aware of. Hi, yeah, you mentioned on the Charlie Rose show once about the New York Times that they sort of turn off all the printing press and are going to give you digital. And I know you've also made some investment recently in media companies like TPM. So I'm just wondering how you see that. Man's Day of the World, I think. Yeah, so, good, good, okay. So I was, a while back, I was on the Charlie Rose show and I talked about how, in my opinion, newspapers, it's easy to have opinions about other people's businesses and they love it when you do, by the way. It's very easy to, my opinion basically was, it's newspapers and magazines in a current form are not economically viable. It's time to shut off the printing presses and go digital. And I provoked it by saying shut off the printing presses because that's what they're all thinking but none of them will say. Because they all say, well, 80% of our revenue is still coming from the printing press, still coming from the printed edition and so, and we're not making much money from digital. And so how can we do that? And of course, my response to that is the reason you're not succeeding digitally is because you're not focused on it, right? You're not, you're playing defense, not offense. So when you go in these organizations, what you find is, you know, attention is exactly correlated to revenue. So if 80% of your revenue is coming from the old-dying business, 80% to 90% of the effort is being spent time trying to preserve the old-dying business, which dooms you to failure in the new business. And so I said, you know, it's the obvious thing to do. And by the way, if you do a margin analysis, like if you look at the cost structure, you would say a lot of the people and a lot of the overhead involved in running a printing press and physical distribution, like if you just nuke all that stuff, you could bring the cost structure to the company down a lot. And then it'd be a lot easier for you to make money digitally because you wouldn't be carrying this huge burden, you know, behind you. A given example, Newsweek Magazine just got put up on the blocks, you know, which is still both prints and online. And they've been Newsweek has been struggling for years to try to figure out how to jump to online, but they still print. And the most revealing thing in the Washington Post and in a report where they talk about Newsweek is Newsweek today. Newsweek, and you know how skinny Newsweek is today. It's like a thin little magazine, like there's not a lot in it. 127 employees. Now if you said, you know, like what would Newsweek online, like what would the true had count be for that same content if it were distributed online, the answer has to be like 30 or 40. Like, you know, you, so what are the other 400 people doing? Well, they're doing circulation and they're doing, you know, they're doing, they're literally, you know, the printing and they're doing the logistics and they're coordination with the news stands and they're doing inventory and then they're destroying all the magazines that get sent back, they don't get sold and it's just on and on and on and on. It's like a certain point. Okay. Like, that's not the future. And so the reason I sort of have even have an opinion on this is because this is exactly the kind of thing that we get faced with in the technology industry all the time. So what's ironic, right? We're actually in the tech industry, we're actually used to dealing with this exact kind of problem because what happens is the technology changes and we have to completely reorient our businesses. And this is the, you know, this is the innovator's dilemma. This is the classic Intel story that Andy Grove tells in his book, Only the Paranoid Survive where he talks about Intel used to be huge in the memory business. It was 80% of the revenue and then the Japanese came in and started systematically undercutting them. And at a certain point they had to shut down the memory business to be able to focus on the CPU business because they knew that was the future, but they knew the memory business had dragged them down. So what I always tell people in the media business is you're just not used to the technology changing like that, right? And then they say, you know, well, that's a good point. The newspaper in his current form was invented in Italy in the 1500s. And I'm like, okay, if I was in an industry where, you know, the current business, literally, the current form of the business had been invented 500 years ago and had not changed. You can see why that would be difficult to deal with. But in my view, you know, leaders of a business, and this is true of every business I've been involved in and every business I've invested in. And it's like top of mind for every time I work with any business is, you know, if there are a set of disruptive changes coming, it's incredibly important to go on offense. It's incredibly important to get set up to be able to compete vigorously. And then this is why I put in my money where I'm out there. This is why I've invested in talking points memo and I've invested in business insider, which is Henry Blot just operation out in New York. They run a whole bunch of sites including Silicon Ali insider. And there's a whole bunch of these tech crunch locally here is another one. The new media businesses are structured properly for the future. And so you go to talking points memo, and it's not a huge company yet, but right? It's also like 30 people, not 427. And it's hiring and not firing. And it's 100% digital. And there's no time and effort, you know, worrying about trying to, you know, charge for content or trying to preserve the print base. And every ounce of effort is going into growth and expansion in the model that makes sense for the future. And it's just a completely different kind of energy. And I think what's going to happen is I think there's going to be a whole new generation of companies that are just going to take over these things market by market. You know, unless more radical change happens, fairly quickly. Yeah. So here's an example. I said earlier, we're not particularly theme driven. So the question was in media reports, we talked about consumer electronics being a key area of interest for us, which causes people to have strange reactions because people think consumer electronics went to, you know, Japan and China and Korea about 20 years ago and haven't come back. So we must be out of our minds. This is an area where, you know, I said earlier, we don't tend to work by category, but of course, you know, we can't help ourselves. And so we sit around and we think that we have theories like everybody else. So one of our theories, which we sort of lend a little bit of weight to, we think there's going to be a whole new wave of consumer electronics companies in the US and particularly in Silicon Valley. And we think that the sort of center of gravity for the whole consumer electronics industry is likely to shift back to the US. And the reason fundamentally is because the technology that goes into a modern consumer electronics device product is completely different than it was when these products left the US, but completely different. And specifically, the hardware is much more commoditized today than it was 20 years ago. Excuse me. And then these products consist of a much higher percentage of software than they used to. And so what we're seeing is a whole pattern of companies in the valley. And I'll just, I'll name a whole bunch. And they're not all super successful or super successful yet, but Paul and Tivo, and of course, Apple and Slang and Flip and Jawbone. There's a whole series of these companies. There's a whole bunch of new ones coming, including some that we're backing. And basically what they all have in common is they're taking off the shelf components, and in particular off the shelf chips. In particular, these really, really powerful new off the shelf graphics chips from companies like Nvidia and TTI that do high speed 3D graphics, and they do high depth video. And it's just all on a single little chip that you can buy for a couple bucks. And they wrap it in a box. It comes in a box. But then they build software and services that integrate right in. And of course, Apple is, in many ways, the template for that these days, the way that Apple provides the device and the OS and the application stack and the store and the online services. And Google's obviously doing a lot of that as well. And so we think that's actually a really interesting model. And so we think there are a whole bunch of categories of consumer electronics that can get reinvented. And then there's a whole bunch of new categories that can get created. And so I'll just give you one example. We are angel investors in a company called Jabo that makes the sort of high-end Bluetooth headset, sort of the high-fashion Bluetooth headset. What's interesting about Jabo and Jabo is an example of this exact thing. Jabo is a real R&D company with deep R&D in Bluetooth and hardware and software. And then the new version of the Jabo and headset that just came out when you connected to your PC, it turns out it has an app store. And of course, at first people think, well, that's crazy. It's a Bluetooth headset. What kind of apps could we possibly be talking about? Well, the ability to read you turn by turn direction, literally read you in your ear turn by turn directions when you're driving around, or the ability to read your voice mails, or the ability to read you a Twitter feed or a Facebook feed, or the ability to do voice SMS. And these are just like these are just the tip of the iceberg. And basically you want to view the Bluetooth headset as a wearable computer that's going to have many different kinds of software applications running on in the future. And so basically if you can do that in Bluetooth, there's any number of categories that you can do that in. So we're extremely excited about this. And if anybody has any great ideas, we're totally game. Yeah. Yeah. This is the job on I kind of talking about in our spaces to make it comfortable with custom fit pieces. We have a big market. We have a market coming where we're spending more and more time interacting with different data. So I'm going comfort of the thing is becoming a concern. And we feel like we have found the solution. We think we've got 10 times, 100 times, 100 acts if you will. But what we don't have is the team. How would you recommend we who are stumbling around in the dark putting together a team that could take this word to this to go? Yeah. So the question is going to be a team around an idea that has traction. You know, it is probably recruiting, actually probably the two hardest parts of running these companies. Number one is recruiting. And number two is talking people out of quitting. And by the way, at first recruiting seems like the hard part. And then later you realize talking people out of quitting is the hard part. And by the way, if you ever go through this and you find yourself talking people out of quitting all the time, it's completely normal. You can't believe how often it happens at successful companies. It's like every day. So I would say the generalize, I don't have any magical answers. The basic answer is brute force. It's going to be kissing a lot of frogs. It's going to be talking to an enormous number of people, a tremendous amount of networking. In some cases, investors and advisors can be very helpful. So one of the things we always tell early stage companies to do, like for example, raising angel rounds of financing is this a good idea to actually bring in a whole bunch of angels and syndicate the deal because a lot of the angels are actually really good at recruiting and networking. That's something we try hard to help with. And then of course, later on, there are some very good local executive search firms and talent and recruiting firms that are helpful. But I mean, it is hard. It's hard for everybody, like there's no real easy answer. Yes. What thoughts went through your mind when MetScape begins to lose popularity and how did you recover that really ultimately sort of a failure in the eyes of a similar? Sure. So we did two things. We did two radical shifts. One is we took the browser to free. It was a question that as MetScape started to come under pressure and started to have issues, particularly with browser market share in the late 90s, we executed two shifts. Now one of the things about a story like MetScape is you don't often actually read the whole story because there's set of popular perceptions. When companies actually become too popular or consumer consciousness, it's hard to actually track what they do as businesses because narratives get set. But we did two things. One is we took the browser to free. And then we ultimately released it as Firefox. And so everybody who loves Firefox today and it's huge numbers today is basically using the MetScape browser essentially version 10 or something like that, version 12, if you look at the lineage. And then the other thing we did was we made a massive, we put a massive investment into a massive turn focusing on actually two things, software for businesses and then our website. And so actually interestingly, MetScape grew revenue all the way through. It's these distances in public company was profitable for virtually the entire existence. And then of course ultimately sold for a lot of money to basically a combination of AOL and Sun. But that's sort of the one of the case studies that I draw on. I mean in my own business, so in MetScape we did this sort of massive shift from browsers to server software and website services. And we're talking like at the time 600 million in revenue, which you know, just for inflation is close to a billion today. So very, very big software business behind that. And then the other shift, my second company went through a huge shift going from being a services business, log club being a services business, software business. And so we did it again there. And also let it go to a good outcome. And actually my third company is going through a version of the shift right now. And then you just went through a shift for people to watch these things from free premium, free plus paid to paid. And so my experience with these things is most of these companies, just my experience generally is most of these companies go through that kind of shift at some point. I'll give you another example. Intel I talked about before. Intel made this shift from microprocessors to memory chips to microprocessors, which was hugely traumatic back in the 80s. Microsoft before that, actually early in its life, made a fundamental dramatic shift that they were forced to basically at the risk of not being a viable company. It's in all the histories. People don't think about it much, but it was very important at the time, which was Microsoft never intended to be in the operating system business. Microsoft intended itself to be a programming tools business. And their revenue was programming tools for people to be able to build software. And they were building basic contributors and all these other kinds of programming tools, selling them to lots of companies making OSs. If you had a PC in the early 80s, no matter who it came from, it probably had Microsoft basic as the programming language. They had this amazing deal in hand to license their programming tools to IBM. But IBM was unable to get a good operating system for a variety of reasons. And so famously they tried to get the dominant PC operating system at the time, it was called CPM from a company called Digital Research. Famously the CEO of Digital Research was out flying his small private plane that day. Couldn't be bothered to meet with IBM. Sent in his wife who was a attorney who was very hard-knosed on the topic of NDAs, completely alienated the IBM team. They got up, walked out, drove back up to Seattle and I told Gates the deal to license Microsoft basic is off unless you can come up with an operating system. And so Gates to his credit said, well, I think I can probably figure that out. He went and bought. So later he went down the street, bought the rights to an OS that a guy down the street had built for $50,000 and that's DOS. Actually, that's part one of the story. Part two of the story is the shift that he tried to make that he failed at making, which turned out to be one of the best failures he ever had. In 1985, Bill wrote a famous letter to John Scully who was then the CEO of Apple, his letters on the internet begging Scully to license macOS to clone vendors. So that there would be lots of different mac clones so that the Mac, UI and OS could take off in terms of market sharing unit volume. And because at that point, Microsoft's view was most of the money is going to be in the apps. So at that point, they were building Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint. And IBM had taken DOS kind of as far as it could go and Mac looked like the next big thing. And so he tried to get a whole mac clone market created. And in fact, he went to, there's an attachment to the letter where he went to Motorola at the time, which is at the time, at the time a big, important computer company. And he had Motorola agreed to basically build mac clones if only Apple would license them macOS. And so he had, he like had the big OEM in hand, took them to, it took the Apple and of course Scully said, no, no way, no way are we ever going to license macOS, which then led to Microsoft developing Windows, which then led to Windows having 97% market share, mac having 3% market share. And so I just, it is so common. I feel like I've been through it now two, three times. The vast majority of businesses I've ever worked with have been through it. I think it's just so common to go through this kind of transition. I think once you get one of these businesses up and running, you have to go through this kind of transition. I mean, in tech it almost seems like you have to do it every five years, almost no matter what. The other classic right Silicon Valley story is son. You know, son like hit it stride in the 80s when it started building, building units workstations. And then they went through a massive structural transition in the early 90s to building servers. That like almost killed the company. It was like incredibly intense. And then of course, you know, years later there was another fundamental structural change that they went through to try to adapt to Linux and Intel servers in the early 2000s. And of course that ultimately led to, you know, some later on being sold at Oracle. That one didn't go as well. But you know, that's again a common story. And so my opinion is sort of a key skill set of actually running these companies or working with these companies is being able to make that kind of transition. And it is never fun, no matter when you go through it. But it's a necessary thing. And so I draw my own experience, you know, having done that a lot. Yeah. What you're doing to start up, I was wondering if you know any startups that are using the new cloud providers and is that a lot of a way to keep costs down when you're doing a brand new startup. And then I was also wondering about for kind of the new trend with user generated content and social networking sites. Right now a lot of sites get some of the good portion of their money from ad revenue. And I'm wondering if you ever see a point where that ad revenue can start being shared with the people generating the content and would that ever be fun? Yeah. Okay, so two questions. I don't remember both questions. So, first question was on startups using cloud services. Let me take that one first. So, virtually, what I mean by also by the question. Virtually all has been very striking. Virtually all of the startups that we see that are building some kind of internet service. Whether it's a web service or a mobile application or even consumer electronics. We saw we've seen startups recently that are building for example different kinds of fitness devices. This new consumer electronics model and it's got an online service component to it. So it's got there's a website that aggregates all the data. Virtually all of these companies are building on cloud services. So virtually all of them are building. And in particular today, interestingly most of them are building on AWS. Like AWS is like 96% or something and then Ratch cases in there and then every once in a while you'll see somebody who's on. I don't think we've seen anybody on Google. Google has a thing called App Engine. I don't think we've seen anybody building on that yet. And we haven't seen anybody building on Microsoft new thing. So Amazon right now is just doing a great job in that market. And this is another sort of factor that's changing the economics of these businesses a lot. It's a really big deal. So these companies otherwise, you know, five years ago these new services companies would have to raise a lot more money a lot quicker because they'd have to buy a lot of servers and a lot of networking gear and a lot of their own data center. And they'd have to buy a lot of storage gear. There's a lot of capital cost involved in building a web service. So back when even back when Facebook started right 2004, 2005 like Facebook today owns a very large number of servers which cost a lot of money. The folks who are running AWS are completely sidesteping that upfront capital cost. So their initial fundraise is much lower than it would otherwise have to be. And then it's much easier to scale at least for the first few years. There's a question of whether ultimately you'll have to jump onto your own servers if you get big enough, whether AWS or one of these cloud services can scale to the really huge services. But a very large number of entrepreneurs are making that that and furthermore a lot of entrepreneurs that are running older internet businesses that had to do all their own back end that didn't have AWS available at the time. A lot of them will now tell you if I were to do it over again, I would definitely not do it the way we did it. I would definitely do it all in the cloud. And so that's a huge, I mean that's just been a huge change, an absolutely fundamental. And again, this is why I get so excited about a lot of these. So I pair actually technology and economics when I talk about the kinds of changes that take place. And so to me, like the way I think about it is what I mentioned with consumer electronics where you have these chips now for a couple bucks that you can buy that do 3D graphics that you can embed it in anywhere. What those chips can do in the 10 years ago would have cost you thousands of dollars. And so there's just all of a sudden a whole new category as a product can get built. And so the cloud services to me are the exact same thing. We can now afford as an industry to experiment on a much broader range of software and services because we can develop them so much more cheaply than we used to be able to. So there's that. And then the other question, user generated content. So question was, you see all these user generated content companies, famously YouTube and blogging platforms and so forth. They all seemed at Twitter most recently and they all seemed to have the characteristic that the company that runs them ends up making a lot of money on advertising and that people who actually create all the content and don't. And so it wouldn't be a good idea to basically share the revenue out with the users. Almost every attempt I'm aware of to try that has failed. And so in practice, and there's been a whole bunch of attempts for 10 years and I bet you have never been heard of any of them because they failed so spectacularly that they just vaporized. So the successful user generated content applications and sites tend to harness people's passions much more than they 10 harness people's greed. And so just in practice, the sites and services that are super geared towards how people think and how they want to live and how they want to act independently of how they make money. But to get people a platform for expression or a platform for communication, that's really good and fun and empowering and wonderful to be on. Like those are the ones that tend to win in terms of user behavior and the ones that try to split revenue generally never get anywhere. And this is one of the, a lot of economists look at this, a lot of free market economists, you know, University of Chicago economists look at this and say, well, this can't be true because everybody knows that humans are purely economically motivated and only want to make money and never want to do anything for fun. And you know, and then you just look, I'll give you another case study, Wikipedia, nobody makes money in Wikipedia. Google launches this big effort called NOL. And the big promise of NOL is that it's going to be like Wikipedia except if you contribute to it, you can make money. And I mean, it's like a dead zone. Like there is like nothing on NOL. And Wikipedia is, you know, gigantic. So it just, Clay Shurkey talks a lot about this in his book, Here Comes Everyone is, there's something really magical about harnessing people sort of in large numbers on things that they love and things that they enjoy doing. And that seems to be the template for it much more than immediately trying to figure out how to help people make money, which is just a really interesting, large scale psychological experiment, but one for which there's now a lot of data. Yeah. And you find your new users, or your first users for both Netscape and Nene, because as far as I can see it, they were both kind of new markets and new categories. You'll be wake up and says, Hey, I want to social network or hey, I want to browse them live at the top. Netscape and Nene come from, because as you say, they're both brand new markets. And so there wasn't a lot of, you know, there wasn't, there wasn't, there wasn't, there wasn't, like people go to the grocery store and they're like, boy, I like one of those Nene things, along with my Coca-Cola. So both Netscape and Nene are, as our Facebook and Twitter, and a lot of these other things are network effects. They're at the core of their network effects businesses. And so the nature of network effects businesses, the definition of network effects basically is that fundamentally you're building a network where people can communicate or share in some way. And the nature of a network is it gets more and more valuable to everybody who's on it as more people join. So, you know, when 10 people are on it, it's not very interesting. When 100 people are on it, it starts getting more interesting when there's a million people on it, it starts getting really interesting. And that very first set of users actually like it more and more as it grows because there's more and more people to talk to. And you often see with these network effects things like they can grow really fast for a very long time because they're just going to continuously more and more useful to everybody who's on them. As another example, we're involved in, as I mentioned earlier, we're involved in Skype and Skype is now, Skype today, right? So Skype now is six or seven years old. Skype today is over. 1.1 million downloads a day, you know, something like closing it on, I don't know, something like 600 million accounts, like just staggering, absolutely staggering numbers and growth rate. And if anything, the growth is accelerated. And a lot of people say, well, Skype was like from 2005, like who cares anymore. It's like, well, Skype in 2005 had like 14 people you could call. Skype in 2010 has like 500 million. Like, that's much more useful. So, the good news of network effects businesses is that when they grow, as they grow, they can often grow very fast for a very long time and they get very useful in the long run, you have this massive chicken and egg problem up front, which is okay, if there's no, it's like, you know, selling somebody the first fax machine, right, was a hard sales call. Just imagine the sales rep saying, well, what can you do with the fax machine? Well, you can draw on a piece of paper, you can stick it in here and you can send it. Okay, well, who can I send it to? Well, nobody. fax machine actually, by the way, fax machine is invented in the 1860s. This may have something to do with the fact that it didn't take off until the 1970s. True story. They have the fax machine working before they have the telephone working. Back in the, they're doing like the Civil War era. So, you have the chicken and egg problem. And so basically what you try to do, what we tried to do with Netscape was you basically seeded into the right initial community to get the, to basically bootstrap the chicken and egg movement. We'll mention it. And what we did at that point was we basically seeded it not surprisingly into people who were super interested in, at that point, the internet, which was a brand new phenomenon. And people who were very interested in internet software and information sharing on the internet. And at that point, there were some other systems with names like Gofer and Waste and FTP that people were using to share files and do things. And so we basically just found those groups of people who are already sharing information on the internet. We just introduced it straight in there. And we actually use, at the time we use news groups to do it because that was where you could talk to all these people. And so that worked. Later with NIG and more recent network effects businesses, new entrepreneurs and network effects businesses are much smarter and much better educated on this phenomenon. And so the new networks effects businesses tend to have what's called this a term called virality. They tend to be viral. And by that, I mean they tend to have a mechanism built straight into the product that causes it to propagate to other users. And so the classic example on this is you sign up for Facebook and it encourages you to upload your email address book and then it tells you, here are all your friends and your address book are already on Facebook and so you can connect to them automatically. And by the way, here are your friends who aren't on Facebook and wouldn't you like to send them an email inviting them to Facebook. And so there's a whole bunch of different viral mechanisms like that that you can employ. And if you do the right and there's a whole art and science to virality, the whole special thing in and of itself. But if you do that right, you can sort of wire a network effects sort of product. You can wire it for growth from a very early stage. And so we did much more of that in NIG. You talked about it. You alluded to the capital cost going lower. And we also alluded to the industry is having to change. But what do you see with the VC industry? How does it can change as capital requirements continue to drop? And do you see how substantially do you see capital requirements dropping for the same consumer of order to detect completely the effects of time? OK, so this is the mother load of all questions for me. So I'll probably talk for about an hour. So the question is, how are the economics of the venture capital industry changing? And in particular, what structural changes are going to happen to venture capital as a consequence of these economic changes? So first of all, I don't believe there is such a thing as the venture capital industry. I don't think it exists. I think you've got a set of firms. You've got 20, 30, 40, boutique venture capital firms that do really well over time. And then you've got about 660 firms that will generally very much break your heart as a investor. If you invest in them, they'll return you less than the stock market with much higher risk. So venture capital is one of those things. Venture capital firms, hedge funds, buy out firms. Investment firms operating in sort of special markets that are illiquid or have special knowledge. You tend to have a few firms that generate all the returns. Then you tend to have a lot of people who want to generate those returns that can never actually figure out how to hurt a bar. If you pull up, you see you can download this list online. If you pull up venture capital firms in the US, it's like 700. And you can read through that for like three hours. And you won't recognize the vast majority of the names on that list. And how they get funded, I don't have the first clue. It's the same thing with hedge funds. There's like 8,000 hedge funds. You don't even know who these people are. The problem is, when you talk about the venture capital industry, all that data gets rolled up. And then they look at it and they say, well, venture capital is terrible because venture capital doesn't make any money. And it's like, well, yeah, if you include all the bad firms, it's terrible. So there's really no, it's this really striking thing where it's interesting. And what's interesting is entrepreneurs know this. And it's not like there's a shortage. There's a bunch of good firms. But entrepreneurs are well aware that there's a set of firms that know what they're doing. And there's a set of firms that really don't. And so there's a whole adverse selection thing that kicks in. So there's two ways of asking the question. One is, what's going to happen to venture capital broadly? And I almost spend like almost no time on that topic. To me, the very interesting question is what's going to happen to the really good venture capital firms? And I think there's a whole variety of things that are happening there. So one is, there's this whole tier of sort of angel or seed funding. Because it's so much cheaper to start these companies, there's a whole tier of angel or seed funding that has now appeared and is becoming sort of very professionalized. And in fact, a lot of the best angel investors are now starting actually raising funds. And so for example, Ronnie, my colleague Ronnie's father, Ron Conway, is one of the really well known Silicon Valley VCs. He's just raised, or angel investors, and he's just raised a new fund to, you know, to even wrap up his activity. And that's very exciting because the best angels are really good. And if anything, the best angels are at least as good or better than the good VCs in a lot of cases. So there's, so on the very early stage, that's very exciting. On the one hand, on the other hand, there's this equally interesting phenomenon that's happening in later rounds. And the classic case study there is this Russian firm called DST that has become a major investor in both companies like Facebook and Zingha and most recently Groupon. And so you may have noticed in the last 10 years, since my last appearance here, on April 7th, 2000, there are very few IPOs. And so you've got some of, you've got companies like Facebook and Zingha and Groupon that are getting very successful financially and getting very large and they're not going public nearly as early as they used to. And so there's this new category of investor that is coming in. And some of these are existing firms that are now getting larger and some of these are new firms that are being created that are coming in or investing later and later in sort of the company life cycle. And some of these firms are taking ownership stakes of hundreds of millions of dollars, 500, 600, 700 million of individual ownership stake in a sort of high growth company at a later stage. Another example of that is actually the Skype deal, which is did, you know, Skype deal was more of an LBO, but it was a little bit of like what I'm describing because it was a $2.75 billion transaction, you know, for a company with at the time about 700 million revenue give or take. And so, you know, and again, it was like, you know, Skype will go public at some point, but, you know, a lot of these companies that maybe in the long run will be public or not yet public. And so there's these specific kinds of investment opportunities that pop up. And so I think that's really exciting. And I think it maps up well how these companies are getting built, which is, and you'll hear people over generalize, you'll hear people say, well, companies cost less to get started. And so therefore, they'll just raise less money than companies used to. And I don't think that's true. I think they raise less money at first. And then I think they raise more money as they grow because the markets are larger. And if you really want to build a company to go into a huge global market, ultimately, you're probably going to have to raise a lot of money because you're going to need to expand to be able to reach the market. So, so all the sort of tension and activity I see around people where you think of their models has to do with some combination of you that are going much smaller or going much larger. Yeah. On Facebook, there's a lot of competition. How do you emerge the winner? Oh, question. How did Facebook, when Facebook got started, there was a lot of competition. How did it emerge the winner? So, when Facebook got started, it's actually been more dramatic than that. When Facebook got started, social networking had been declared dead and buried. So, Forenster had failed. And so, Forenster, I think this company Forenster, hopefully people in the audience are not so young that you don't remember. Forenster, although time flies. So, Forenster appeared in like 010203 and was this, used the Silicon Valley startup, very bright entrepreneur named Jonathan Abrams. And Forenster was sort of the first big social networking service that took off and it grew at a sort of a vertical takeoff rate. And then a bunch of things went wrong and it had huge issues and lost lots of its users. And most people around the valley concluded, okay, that's, you know, basically that was evidence of category failure. And so, like that's the social networking has been proven to not work because Forenster didn't work. Later on, Myspace, and then after that, shortly after that, Facebook emerged. And essentially, like, they did some things differently. So, Myspace focused on a basically entertainment and Los Angeles as a sort of initial seating ground as opposed to Silicon Valley and then Facebook, Constraint on college campuses. And so, they seated the network effect differently, although they both became large services ultimately. So, they took a different approach to basically get to market. But in my opinion, that's all sort of the beginning of the story. The real story has been Facebook in the last five years. Facebook has become one of the great Silicon Valley technology companies. And so, when you look inside Facebook at what the company actually is, it is a technology, it's a technology machine, it is a development machine with world-class software capabilities that are easily equivalent to what you would find at Microsoft or Oracle or at any great historical software company. It's a really, really top-notch software company. And it's like Google in that way. It's the same thing, right? When you go to say Google, it's a world-class software company. And what we've seen at Search Engines is it's a huge asset. It's been a huge asset for Google to be world-class at R&D. It's been the cornerstone of why they succeeded. I think the same thing is true for Facebook. They just become world-class at R&D, phenomenal software engineering. A lot of Facebook's competitors in the last few years have not been as good at software engineering. And Myspace in particular had the potential to become that good. But they got bought by News Corp and there was a whole series of management changes there that sort of prevented them from developing another company they could have been. And so, at this point, Facebook is an absolutely phenomenal engineering company. And to me, it's one of the reasons I'm so excited about our business is because I think Google and Facebook are great examples among many others, but are great examples of how the value is still, the value is still very bad at many things, but the value is very good at creating new technology companies. And in a lot of big, important markets, the quality of the technology and the products really matters. And I think both of those companies are case studies of that. Yes, go ahead on the cheap building question I was asked earlier. You talked up networking in order to attract people to apply your company. But when you're a three person startup with no revenue, it's just an exciting vision. How do you convince your top choices once you've identified them to actually join your venture instead of going to Microsoft or Google? Yep. So stock options, which they'll tell you. Those aren't worth anything. And then a friend of mine likes to say in the part of it is vision. And he says the different stream of vision and hallucination is that other people can see the vision. And I think that's actually the core answer to the question. So, the best entrepreneurs are really good at selling people on their company precisely because they can explain the way the world is going to look in a way that is so compelling. This is the famous Steve Jobs, if you talk about Steve Jobs, he calls the reality distortion field. So, if you get within 10 feet of Steve Jobs, whatever he says in the next 20 minutes, you're going to walk out of their believing. But whatever he says, you know, he can say the sky is purple and he'd be like, yep, that makes total sense. And you know, four hours later over dinner as you're explaining it, you know, to your wife, your husband, and he'd like, well, you know, I don't really know when he met by that. But it was really, really compelling at the time. The best entrepreneurs all tend to have that in common. They tend to be really good at that. They tend to be really, it's essentially sales, you know, selling to employees. And so, it's incredibly, it's an incredibly valuable skill to be able to do that. That plus stock options. The other thing I found with hiring over the years is that while it's incredibly frustrating, part of the frustration is actually a good thing. Because the frustration right is you try to talk somebody into joining, they don't come, and you're like, you know, damn it, I wasted a lot of time. But hiring is also a selection process, and it's a self-selection process in the part of the candidate, right? And so, of all the people you interview, like if you hired them all, it would turn out that a good two thirds or three quarters of them, you probably shouldn't have hired anyway. And what you can do in the hiring process, what the best companies do is they provide a very stark idea of what their company is and what it isn't. You know, so we are a company where people are expected to work 18 hour days, and if you don't like that, don't come here. Or we are a company where people are expected to go home at 5 o'clock every day, and if you think that would be frustrating, or whatever it is, or we have dogs in the office, or we have a company, we have a company we've invested in, where the whole company does yoga together. And so, if you like yoga, this is the company for you. If you don't like yoga, don't go there. You're going to be asked to put your feet in positions that you're just going to be completely uncomfortable with. Literally, yoga every day. Companies called Asana, which of course is a means a yoga post, I learned. So a very, very, very stark idea is very good because it's polarizing. And I think the best companies tend to be polarizing. And so if in your higher process, you're turning people off as often as you're turning them on, because it's just you're making it, they're sort of deciding, well, this is clearly not the right fit for me. I think that's a good thing. And actually, by the way, the same thing applies later on to product development sales. We much prefer companies that have polarizing products. We love companies where products where some people hear about it, and they're like, that's awful. I would hate that. You need an example of Forsquare. We were recently in the bidding for, we dropped out, but we were in the bidding for Forsquare. You describe Forsquare to like 20 people. Forsquare is a location-based service where you can check in and you can see where all your friends are, and they can see where you are. Like you described that to 20 people, like 16 of them are like, that is the scariest stupidest thing I've ever heard. Like, why would I, it's like, there's actually a website called pleaserobbing.com. And they use the Forsquare API, and they basically give you a running list of the names and addresses of people who have announced that they're not at home. So like this just freaks people out. Well, we love it, because 16 people out of 20 might hate it, but the four people who love it just absolutely love it. And they pride themselves on like being on Forsquare all the time and logging in all the time. So we would much rather back a company that has that kind of polarizing vision. My other favorite one recently that we're not in, but I love Blippi. And it's a Blippi's the one where all of your purchases are online, right? You just plug in your credit card and all of a sudden everything you buy is listed online for your friends to see. And again, most people, I see eyebrows going up. Most people are like, oh my god, you know, I buy stuff that I wouldn't want anybody to see. I wonder what that is. You can maybe later on everybody can volunteer one thing they bought that nobody didn't know about. But Blippi's already has a core community of people who just think this is the best idea ever. And so another great example is there's this whole phenomenon of people. There's this like health and fitness bloggers who are like fantastic because they're like documenting extensive detail like all of their like, you know, all the stuff they're eating, all the stuff they're not eating, all the way they're losing, all their bodily functions. Like you can learn stuff about people that like, you know, where I grew up, like you didn't talk about. But people love it because it's certain kind of people, certain kind of person loves it because it's social reinforcement and it's being part of the community. And so yeah, we love polarization and I think that also works for recruiting really well. Yeah. So when you're looking at our early stage company, how do you come up with evaluation for investing in those companies? Yeah, it's question is on an early stage company, how do you come up with evaluation for the investment? So for an early stage company generally, there's just a set of sort of market comparable. And so generally you basically look, what we do as investors is we just kind of look at a cross section of other companies that are, you know, similar founding team, similar potential of idea, similar state of company. And so, you know, and this is all, I think Ronnie's expert on this, but there's, you know, if it's, you know, if it's two people, two founders who have not started a company before and have a brand new idea and don't have anything running yet, the evaluation could be arbitrarily low, it could be, you know, 500,000 pre or something or a million pre. If it's, you know, two people who have successfully started a company before and sold it for $50 million, then the evaluation might be two or three or four pre. If it's, you know, Diane Green who started VMware, you know, Bill Gates decided to start his next company, you know, the evaluation will be significantly north. So track record of people. The other real moving target that you see a lot is, you know, it goes to this product, the product becomes a company versus a company that comes up with a product. Product that becomes a company, those will get higher evaluations in general because there's already something running. And I always tell people, especially in software, like by far the best thing to do for a fundraising standpoint is actually build the product first and then raise money, like, or at least raise a very small amount to build the product and then raise large around the money because you get dramatically more leverage that way. And actually as investors, we enjoy that, you know, because it's nice to be able to, it's nice to be able to see people with a small amount of money to build initial product without having to take a big gamble and then it's nice to be able to double down once they prove that it works. Yeah. In the past 10 years, aggregators have turned to be lower than previous 10 years and the VC thing is a proxy for that as well as lower and investing capital. Do you think that's a function of the actual value that's being created, financial markets? Why do you think that is? The question is, in the last 10 years, you mean overall, like, aggregate equity value, stock market value? There's obviously been a lot lower in the last 10 years. I don't know people have noticed this, but the stock market has sucked for 10 years. Different 401K, you might have noticed. Versus the 90s and then venture capital. Yeah. So venture capital is a proxy for that. So venture capital generally is sort of a, you can think of venture capital is almost a form of leverage, sort of higher risk, higher return on top of equities. I mean, you know, I'm not, you know, I'm not an economist, but my diagnosis is that the stock market is manic-depressive and there are periods in the 90s where, you know, everybody is all excited and there are people, it's times in the 2000s where everybody's all depressed about everything. So I just restricted the technologies. But I think that's also true. So in tech, in tech, the, so, okay, so I'll give you the answer first and explain. So as far as I can tell, technology, new technologies follow a shockingly straight, sort of linear line. And part of that is more as a law. Like part of that is just the mechanics of like how some marketers get built where they follow very predictable patterns over time. But also like software advances, like software advances just keep coming. Like every year there are more, you know, better software tools and better software infrastructure and better programming techniques and programmers keep getting smarter and more productive. Banwith keeps getting cheaper. Like there's a huge amount of progress. And in fact, from 2000 to 2005 was a time of fantastic technology progress. Like the prices on all kinds of things dropped tremendously. New kinds of applications got created. Google took off. Facebook got created like all kinds of things happen. So as far as I can tell, there is a very large disconnect between what's actually happening in the technology and then whatever's happening in terms of, especially in terms of the public stock market. And then the private market sort of, you know, echo that just certain extent. So, you know, my only conclusion is you essentially, to be in this business, you essentially have to ignore the opinion of sort of the broad base of investors. Be precisely because they're going to be manic, impressive. And the other thing I would say is trying to, you know, you say, well, what if you wanted to take that into account? What if you wanted to think about it? Well, the problem is that when people try to, when people in technology think too much about what's happening in the broader markets or in the stock market, they tend to want to try to get involved when things are hot. When the stock market is hot and they tend to want to bail out when the stock market is low. So, you know, a very large number of people, you know, came out of investment banking, came to Silicon Valley in 1999 because they thought they're going to make a lot of money. And in 2001, they all turned around and went back to New York and created the credit crisis. That worked out well. And so, you know, it's almost like a buy high sell low kind of thing. You know, I guess my own personal point of view is just, it's irrelevant. It'll even out over time. And if you're building real value and technology, it'll ultimately show up in the prices. But, you know, that could take five years, 10 years, 15 years. That could take a lot of time. It's one of the reasons actually, light being in the venture capital business. Venture capital is actually a very interesting asset class like BIOTS because you have this enormous virtue of a 10-year lockup on the funds, right? So, we raised money in July of 2009. We have until 2019, right? It guaranteeing contractual lockup. And then we actually have the ability to extend it down that, right? If the stock market is low. So, you know, I talked to friends of mine who run hedge funds or mutual funds. And, you know, mutual funds get redeemed on a daily basis. Hege funds get redeemed quarterly. Venture capital gets redeemed every like 13 years. Like, it's perfect. It's outstanding. And so, you know, our view obviously is we should take full advantage of that. We should be funding things that have, you know, enormous longer potential. And then if it takes seven to 10 years, and if we go through a full up and down cycle and then back in and up cycle in that time, you know, that's just fine. So, that's our goal. All right.
