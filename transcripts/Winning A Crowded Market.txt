 Who you are defines how you build. This is the OddPattern thought-leaders series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. On this episode, we're joined by Eric Yuan and Santi Subatowski. Eric is the founder and CEO of Zoom Video Communications and Santi is a general partner at Emergence Capital where he led the firm's investment in Zoom. Welcome everybody to the next session of Stanford's entrepreneurial thought-leaders seminar. Welcome the Stanford community and welcome to the broader public via YouTube. I'm Ravi Blani, a lecturer in the Department of Management, Science, and Engineering at Stanford and also the Director of Alchemist and Accelerator for Enterprise Startups. And this is presented, the Entrepreneur Thought Leader series is presented by STVP, the Entrepreneurship Center in Stanford School of Engineering, and basis the Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students. Seldom, I think if ever, have I been able to say that tonight's or today's talk would not be possible without our two speakers? Because literally, we're coming to you on the platform that was created and funded by our speakers. And I don't think that there is another product in 2020 that has become such a ubiquitous part of our lives as Zoom. And so we are incredibly honored for the time of Eric Yuan and Santi Subatowski, who have joined us. Eric Yuan was one of the first 20 hires and VP of Engineering at the video conferencing startup WebEx, which he joined in 1997. WebEx was then acquired a decade later by Cisco in 2007, where Eric became the VP of Engineering. He then left Cisco in 2011 to launch Zoom, which I know we're all familiar with, but is now valued at $150 billion publicly and is one of the most valuable companies in the world. Santi Subatowski is a general partner at Emergence Capital and he led the firm's investment in Zoom. Santi holds an MBA from the Stanford of the East from Harvard and ABS and economics from St. Andrews University in Argentina. Santi is not only a press investor, but he's also a founder at heart, having founded AXG ASAS, a learning company in Argentina before his days as a venture capitalist. And he's also a founding board member of Quenta Labs and an organization that helps founders of high potential growth companies in Latin America scale their businesses globally. So please welcome Eric and Santi to ETL. Eric and Santi, lots of virtual love for you guys. Geng, I want to start off because I know that everybody knows Zoom now and it feels like a foregone conclusion that Zoom is the phenomenon that it is. But back in 2011, that was not necessarily clear. And in fact, this is a story that even though it feels like it came out of nowhere, the reality is is that Eric, you started Zoom in 2011. You started WebEx or you're part of one of the first 20 people at WebEx in 1997. And so really this started 23 years before today to get to this moment of where you're at today. And I want to start then from those early days of starting Zoom because even though few people I think realize it, but at the time starting another video web conferencing company in 2011 was like the classic thing not to do. And it was sort of the classic lesson of what a venture capitalist would not fund. You had Cisco, had WebEx, Microsoft, had acquired Skype, Google had Hangouts, prominent VC funds and funded companies like BlueJeans Network. And there was consumer offerings like Facebook Live coming and it was an intensely crowded space. And so I want to start from that moment in 2011, when you're in this intensely crowded space, what was your intention when you started? Was the intention just to build another great product or did you have a vision that was fundamentally different where you wanted to, where you're thinking about more than just a video product? Yeah, so really first of all, thank you so much for having me. And I think you just described the problem back in 2011. That's one of the key reasons when I talk with friends or investors, you say, wow, there's no way for you to put it all. But it's so crowded, so many other companies. But the way I look at it is, you've got to understand when things, when you try to build something, why do you build that? It's not for your investors, feel free and for any user. Because I spend a lot of time talking with every friend, every I know and no matter which is solution they were using back then, I always ask them, I do you like that solution? I did not see the same new user talking that I really enjoy this and that. No, then I realized, wow, if that's case, I might have a chance. If I can build something better, I think that can survive. That's really why I dared to start. And yeah, that's how I started. And I love that because there is this mantra these days that don't go after what's called red ocean waters that are shark infested, go after the blue ocean waters where nobody is there. And I love the fact that Zoom emerged from a red ocean market. And so this question is for all the founders that are in spaces where the VCs are saying that's an intensely crowded space or if you make that feature, what would prevent Google or Microsoft just from copying you. How do you know if in fact you should listen to yourself and not to the VCs? It sounds like it's you listen to your users. And specifically when you listen to your users, was there a threshold in your mind about what you were looking for to know that this was not just good but a great opportunity? Is it just if the users say, did you measure that in anywhere? Was it more just a feeling? You are so right. I think the two things. First of all, you are so right. You know, listen to in the user. That's number one. Number two, in terms of size, opportunity of the market. That's really hard. I do not see you have a formula to say, hey, this is big. That's a small, you know, quite often, you know, take a rubble from example. When you started, everyone thought, that's a small niche market. It hit an order huge market, right? I think when Google and started, they already have a yacht. I think you started from listening to any user plus, I think sometimes in terms of opportunity, when you start, you do not know how big it is. However, in the future might be bigger and bigger. I think as long as you can have a solution and plus you have a vision, you can build something better than others and you know, essentially deliver a unique value for some of the users. I think it's the right. Don't always think about, hey, I have to enter into a market. It's a huge market. It's not like that. I hope every business, I think. So you didn't go in having this vision that this was going to be the $150 billion phenomenon that it is. That was unique. You didn't need to be there. I think the $150 billion is good enough. One billion? Yeah. I guess so why? Seriously, even today, I never think about why the last week, I just had our user conference. That's what I learned from a media CEO, co-founder, Jason Huang. Don't look at the score, you know, focused on the game. So don't look at the big, position market. Think about how you can survive, keep serving your customers. A long way, you might have an other opportunity to start with, always start with very, very small. I think it's certainly new set. I always talk about in our board meeting how we can survive as a company. How we can survive. We never say no to think about it, the bigger things. So I love that. That idea of focusing just on survival and focusing on, you know, thinking about what could kill you and then just how and chasing that. I want to get that really clear though, so for people because if people are in situations where in that market where everybody is telling you, you know, we don't need another video conferencing technology platform, was there a practice that you used to center yourself to focus on? Did you use like a dashboard of saying, you know, I'm just going to be focusing on this metric and that's what I'm going to sense my sense of confidence in is just if we're performing on this one or two, these two metrics, or did you use something else to center your attention and focus on to zone out all the other naysayers that were giving you all this other feedback? I think for now for sure we have, I think a list of the word in the matrix in terms of usage, financial matrix a lot. Early on, when we started Zoom, there's no any metrics. When we're doing metrics I have is when I talk with a user, how do you like Zoom? When I pay the user's cancerous service, I was telling them a personal email, why did you cancerous service? What do we can do differently? Sometimes when the user is all I cancered because I'm going to travel next two months, I mean, you know, use that I do like your service. I will come back. When we get got more and more feedback like that, I feel like we are on to the right direction. It's hard. I do not, we do it. We as new if it was to matter that. So you didn't use a net promoter score or some other equivalent score. You just every time somebody was said, no, that's what you focused on is why you said, why did you leave? No, I think of four years, maybe five years after the start of the company, back in 2015 or 2016, we do use the empty at the school. But prior to that, I think that, you know, we really do not have any student to better that. And you didn't have a North Star metric then. It was just this, this, this ethic of just focusing on the users. Okay. Yep. I love your story, Eric, even more. So because you didn't not only started Zoom in a crowded market, you also overcame, and maybe that wasn't even caught. You weren't conscious about it, but that you, you had all these elements that are fears that prevent other students from becoming founders in the sense that you were an engineering background. You had never been a CEO before. You also were in your 40s with a very lucrative job at the time. And you convinced your family that, you know, I'm going to go jump this lucrative job and start something. You were an immigrant and some founders have this sense that, you know, if they can't speak, English is not their first language. That's a liability. And so I know we're not going to have enough time to go through all of that. But I want to start with the first thing, which is the engineering, as an engineer. Was that at all in your mind, did you view that as an asset or a liability starting Zoom as the CEO, having been a VP of engineering for the last two decades? Well, for sure, it's not a liability. And so when you start something, you need a builder product. Like if you have an engineer background, at least you know how to build something. Also at the same time, if you have a business partner, like a co-founder, you know, to have a new company, you'll likely be great. Or, you know, if you also have an interest, right, about the business model, or sales, or go to market, even do not need to have a co-founder, right? I think again, you know, it have an engineer background. It's always a good thing. It's always a good thing. So you just want that message to get there. Yeah. And how do you spend a typical day today? And is it different than how you spent a typical day when you started? And what I'm wondering is, are you still involved deeply on the engineering side today? As you were when you began? That's a great question, increasingly enough. If you ask about this question nine months ago, I will have a different answer. For now, I think that today, the way I leave everything, excited, same as the 2009, you know, sleep, eat, zoom. That's it. Now for now, the zoom is more like a developer zoom. For now, it's more like I'm using zoom, right? So for the portfolio of three years, sleep, eat, and a developer product. That's it. Nothing else. For now, all of the stuff is in the simulator. But right now, how much of your time is spent on engineering in zoom? And how much of it's spent on business? I think probably around 20 or 25% on engineer now, and it's 75% on some CRs, but you should be 80% or 85% on engineering. It was on engineering. And so for the engineers that are going to become CEOs for the first time, do you have any practical tips or key pieces of advice that have been really helpful for you as you now are shifting more of your time on the business side and less on the engineering side that you wish you knew earlier? I think if you have an engineer background, you want to start a company, send yours in the call for sure. He would like to finally you, right? So, you know, a lot of wishes like a send the, you know, the like to find, you know, support those entrepreneurs with the engineer, you know, background. Again, I think to have engineering background is great. It's the plan. I think the only thing is you got to, you know, think about it. Do you like, you know, like sales or marketing or others you do? You can do it by yourself. If you don't like that, find a co-founder. You really trust, you can work it together well. I think it's something similar to a lot of others. Start a company, send a send the money, you have a two to three co-founders. I think you can start. Again, you know, don't worry about like go to market, a business model, a sales marketing, you can always learn. I because, you know, you have time, right? You know, get a book to learn, send a convoy, there's so many great, you know, we see it's great entrepreneurs, successful leaders, they can help you out. They don't worry about it. Nobody is very well prepared when they start a something. You always start by wencing, it's good enough. I think that's great advice. Everybody has certain trade-offs, gang. So everybody has this feeling that they're not complete, but that is normally just have to know what you don't like and get that handled in some way. And Eric, I understand that also you sometimes bring around a stack of books when you're working in different spots or maybe pre-COVID, and you hand these books out to employees and others. Are there, if you had to hand out any books to the aspiring founders, especially maybe the former engineers who are going to become CEOs, are there any books that you would recommend they read? For sure. I think Ed is zoomed. The one thing is we always re-enbrurt any books you buy for yourself, for your family, because this is our complete mentor, you know? Promote employees and reading a book. I think that Ed is zoomed in a spot in everything. It's no spot in no speed. I think the favorite book for zoom is the speed trust. The author is staffing COVID. I think this is a great book. However, there's a lot of other books, right? Let me know the hardest thing about a harder thing, as a lot of a great book, as any book can help you. That's great. One more question, Eric, then I'm going to move to Santi, which is on when you left, you were making a lot of money as the VP of engineering at WebEx. You had three kids, you have a wife, you have a lucrative job, you're managing 800 people, you have all this prestige. How did you convince your wife and your family and also yourself to take the leap? So, you are so right, actually, time is flies. It's still remembered at the moment. Six ways is a great company. And being a corporate vice president, you know, the kiddie you were. I think it's very, I never tried to convince myself. I knew that's my dream, because I lived in Silicon Valley. I call that a startup valley. I knew somebody I will start a company. I think a bag is in that's the best time. But to convince your family, remember, like my wife, you are so right, it's not that easy. I still remember what my wife told me that, what you have a great job at the Cisco, right? And the kiddie you were, well, you want to start over from a grown up, but the beauty, something, you know, she had all kinds of questions. No way for me to have a good answer. So, but again, you got to trust your feeling, and I was already 40 when, yes, or that time, I also put up her. If I want to try, it is a winning time. In other words, soon, I mean, I don't have enough energy, right? So, yeah, anyway, that's how I started. It's not that it's three to four word, and but we've got to move forward, even if you cannot convince others. I'm going to move to Santi now. And Santi, I want to ask you about what you saw. Obviously, I think Zoom obviously is something that took off. We'll talk about that in a second. But I think another common thread between Eric and you is that you're both immigrants. You both were born and raised in countries outside the United States, and you came to the US. And Santi, so, gang, I know Santi personally, and Santi is actually the first Latin VC that I think I ever knew. And I don't know if it's Santi, you are the first Latin VC's, maybe the first GP at a major fund. And you can correct me if I'm wrong. But if that's the case, can you share a bit about that path and that journey into venture capital? What was it like coming as a Latin person into venture capital on the early, how did that, how did that venture? And what was that path like? Yeah, first of all, thank you for having me. It's always great whenever I'm chatting with Eric or you, Ravi, just makes my day. I get a lot of energy. So I appreciate you having me here. And there are other Latin VC's out there that are doing really well. For me, it wasn't straight forward. And they tell people when Eric started Zoom, a lot of people told him VC, video conference. There's a room for another video conferencing company. They told me the same thing when I moved here 10 years ago. I remember I had Excel spreadsheet where I was tracking all the VC's that I was talking to. I had 77 VC's that I was talking to. And the majority very well-known VC's would tell me that there were no Latinos in venture. So again, VC is not for you. You should go and try something else. It's like, go look for a different job. And then maybe scratch my head. It's like, what is it? Is it that we don't have the gene or something that's going to prevent us from getting into venture? And I actually got a lot of energy from that. Because it made me work harder to prove that I could do it. It's like, if you have an obsession with something that a rational passion that Eric had when he wanted to solve this problem, you need to keep on trying. And eventually you're going to find the people who believe, noting your skills, but believing you. And I had those people in my life who believed in me and giving that opportunity. I'm eternally grateful for that. Another, I mean, Alex Mendez from Storm Ventures, he was the first one to give me a job in venture. He said, we don't have a job, but we'll allow you to stop by and learn. And thanks to that offer, I was able to learn and get into this. So again, I like when people tell me it can't be done, because it just makes me work harder. Well, I think that is like the canonical experience of entrepreneurship is when the external world is telling you something, but you have some internal conviction, and you have to choose or you have to decide which one you listen to. And knowing when to listen to the outside and when to not listen to the outside and to beat your drum even louder, to make sure that it's being heard. And I think that gets to the essence of it. Can you speak to then how when Eric came to you for Zoom, and you can speak to where he was at at that journey? I don't know if you were courting him or if he was courting you, but one, but if you either way, how did you succeed in that pursuit? How did you want, because if you want, you can speak to how intensely competitive the market was, and why, and or how was Zoom able to get its financing? Because I think there are some students that are asking that question, how do you get your first investors? Santiago, I don't think it was the first, but even Santiago later, how did you then win the getting into Zoom if it was on the rise? I mean, I'll tell myself of the story, and then I'd love to hear Eric's take, but I courted him. And I courted him because I was one of those frustrated users, being from Argentina, I have a lot of friends and family there. Nothing worked for me when I wanted to stay in touch. I could call them and I could get like a family recipe or something, but I couldn't build a relationship because technology didn't work. My wife worked and lived in Nairobi, Kenya for a while. And again, to stay in touch, it was really hard, and this is going to date me, but I was using those scratch cards to communicate with her, and it was really painful, and I felt that our relationship was getting weaker and weaker because we couldn't do this. We couldn't look at each other in the eyes and see how people were reacting. So I had that need myself, and that's why I've been trying every technology out there for this for a long time before came across Zoom. And I came across Zoom back in 2013, so it was early in the journey of Zoom. And I remember testing it with my aunt in Argentina. She didn't speak English. She didn't own a computer or anything, and she downloaded the app to her phone, and we were zooming, and it worked consistently. And that's when I realized that the product was doing something different, and it changed my life early on. And then when I met Eric, the whole relation it worked to a completely different level. It was less about the product, the metrics, the market, and it was more about Eric. At the end of the day, I don't think that I invested in Zoom, the company, or Zoom the metrics, or Zoom the video conferencing market. I partnered with Eric because I connected with him, and I could see myself working with him for a very long time and becoming great friends. And what made Eric stand out? Because there are a lot of engineers that start companies. There were a lot of video conferencing companies at the time, and I'm asking this because the students are asking about how you got your first investment. There is this consistent question around, how do you get a VC to actually give you money? And Sante, you are a VC. You see thousands of pitches. What was it about Eric that made him great and not just good, whereas the other founders may seem good and not great? Yeah, I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all. There are some investors who are looking for the metrics, some investors who are looking for the market. I'm looking for the people. And when I met Eric, he didn't have a pitch. When I visited him in the San Jose office, he would come down and greet me and walk with me up the stairs, and they found out that the elevator never worked. And that's why he wanted to guide me into the right office. I mean, there were a bunch of this first offices in that building. But he had the human side of the entrepreneur who was doing Zoom for the right reasons. It wasn't about, I want Tecran to write about me. It wasn't about, I want to get the highest valuation. It was there's some problem here that I need to fix, and I'm not going to stop until I fix it. And we see a lot of entrepreneurs that are studying companies just because all my friends are studying companies, it's so cool. I'm going to do it. And those entrepreneurs end up giving up when things get tough. And things get tough in the life of a company. It doesn't matter if you're small or if you're big, but if you're passionate and obsessed with addressing that problem and that end customer, then you're going to run through walls. You're going to make things happen. And like Eric, I mean Eric is working very long hours. And he's been working very long hours for a long time. It's not just now. And that's because he believes in what he's doing. And his team believes in him. And he feels and he knows he owes this to every stakeholder. Not just shareholders, but customers, employees, the community, the world. And when you find someone like that, it's one thing I like. That's great. And Eric, can you comment on what it's like to be an entrepreneur right now at your stage? Because it's rare for us to get a CEO founder who's at this stage in terms of, you know, it's not to say how you're still working hard hours. I know Eric doesn't like to think about the money, but the, you know, Zoom's valued at $150 billion. You're one of the wealthier people in the world now. You know, you have more, you don't need to work. But what is a day in your life like? Like how many hours do you work every day? Is it a stressful life? Is it, is it less fun now than it was at the beginning? Or is it more fun now than it was at the beginning? I think it's given that audience a lot of our Stanford. So last week and we held our annual user conference in Zuma Topia. I invited a co-founder and a CEO of the immediate, a Jensen farm. Right? I had a similar question. Now this water he told me that is his quote. Right? I love my work. I love the purpose of my work. I enjoyed working hard. Remember, he started a company back in 1993. Look at what he did. Look at what immediate change in part industry. Right? I think he is our new model. And I have excited that I think it has so many great other entrepreneurs. Right? They all want to work hard because they really enjoy working hard. They feel like this is a great opportunity, right? To help, to make the world a better place. Otherwise, fast-forward 20 or 30 years later, when you look back, he was, oh, I regret. I had all the energy back in the sun. I did not do the right thing. Right? I think if you enjoy building up something, enjoy the work, you do not feel tired. Right? If anything else, if the second, how you can build something to help, to help the world, I think that's where I think the sustainable. And you might be enjoying doing that. And is it, when has it been the most enjoyable at Zoom? Is there a certain phase of Zoom in the last nine years that was the most enjoyable? Every day, the same. Every day the same. And how many hours are you working every day? It's the 3-D depends, right? I had it back in April on a march. I had more sleepless nights than any time in my career. I think every day is different. I think I'm picking it back in April. I had a total of 19 Zoom meetings. And I do not think that works. Seriously, I really do think that's work. I just enjoy that. You think that's my life, but this is work. You know, I didn't know of any difference. But Eric, you not only built an amazing product, but you also built an amazing product during this tsunami of a time in the world when COVID hit. And so in March and in April, when COVID was becoming, it was clear that this was going to become the new normal and this pandemic was spreading. Can you tell us what it was like inside of Zoom at that time or what it was like to be the CEO? As I mentioned, I had a more sleepless nights. It's not that easy. On the one hand, every employee in Zoom, we were very excited. If we like many years of hard work, finally, it's well-voted off. Even my kids, the school, they can use Zoom for online classes. Your neighbor can talk about it. You Zoom for like a high-paying hour for online yoga class. So you're very excited from that perspective. Also at the same time, guess what? You know, you have to work harder. Like, because the users, you know, came from all over the world. You have at a capacity, you've got to embrace a lot of new use cases. You know, privacy, challenges for consumers. They are very different in user-based, user-based, and the class, you know, and you need to make sure your internal process is not broken. And, you know, it's not that easy behind it. But a good news investment on the company's future and value. You know, in this critical time, looking back, I think this is something I think I feel very proud. You know, you're employed at a Zoom in the company. They all worked very hard. They all wanted to leverage this opportunity to have a Zoom to become a better company and to have the people stay connected. That's great. I'm going to turn to the student. So I've been asking some questions, but I'm going to go explicitly to the student questions. The most popular question right now is, people want to know how you think Zoom will be affected when we finally get through COVID. And the world starts to come back to normal. Is that something that you think about and any thoughts on that? We do. But first of all, I hope that hopefully this crisis can be overworked. So it's not only easy. We all worked from a home for such a long time, a mental health depression. I think even after the pandemic has been requested to work, I should have believed the hybrid, the work, you know, at least will be the future. So meaning, you know, even if we all go back to the office to work, we're likely, you know, we probably send employees back at home one day or two days a week. I think the way for us, you know, to level to the two sliders, we'll think. I'm not seeing the usage like today, right? However, the two sliders, we will have. It's not as it was think about what we can innovate. And what are the kinds of new use cases? That's okay. We do not worry about all uses might decline. That's not important for us. Well, that's interesting. So you're not measuring based on whether users are going to decline or not. You're what and then what are you measuring? Is it just, again, you know, our goal is to truly deliver happiness to other customers, right? Because customers send out the feedback. I think of this online class from the, example, university, they see a lot of the using Zoom. And it seemed like they shared the feedback. Can you have this feature, that feature? They were thinking about maybe you should have a different user interface, right? And also a lot of Zoom hosts. You see, like online yoga class teacher, you know, water can be due, right? To have those people more, host them more. Meaning, you know, we can edit the payment feature in bad things with do. And also can have those meeting hosts to, you know, to publish their events, right? I think a lot of things can be done. And to serve those users well, that's our focus. And is there a dashboard now that is there, is there a North Star metric that's guiding you? I guess this isn't some sense a chaotic time as well. Even when you were starting, it was intensely competitive and yet to zone things out. Now, it's also sort of crazy in a different way. Is there an compass of a dashboard or metric? And I know you, it is the users, but is there something specifically that you use to measure or to track your progress against? I think on financial front, we do have some metrics, because we are public company, right? We need to put it back to the identity to the board and the world's street. That's very important. But at the end of the day, I really do not like if it's a metrics-driven company, right? You've got all of us, there's no innovation. We've got to think about where metrics may be to the impious goal. That's really important, right? And now the metrics, what we can do is spend more time with customers, with users, listening to their feedback, come back, work as hard as we can to come up with solutions ahead of any of other vendors, right? That's the most important metrics. With that, you will have a lot of ideas coming from your employees, if you spend more time to interact with your users. That's great. We have a question from one of the students, Andrew, who wants to know what are strategies to deal with competitors back by massive companies like Alphabet. You now have a big target on your back from the big trillion-dollar companies. How do you compete? No strategy. Why do you look at competitors? I can't add a mention many times. If I look at competitors, I even do not dare to start a Zoom. If I look at competitors every day, I cannot sleep. There's already so many things that keep you up in the night. If I always look at competitors seriously, I even cannot sleep well. Spending more time talking with your customers and users. That's the case. Don't think about competitors. What if your competitors are making mistakes? Are you going to call me? What is they doing? Right? Of course, a lot of people are competitors. That's not their focus. It's easy. Again, if you always look at competitors, that's another reason why so many smart people, they cannot start a Zoom. Look at the user, look at the consumer, and look at all your customers or partners. Don't look at the competitors. I think that's great. And we do live in this tech crunch culture, where we glorify these trillion-dollar companies and these huge raises and these huge valuations. But we don't spend enough time oftentimes talking about the struggles that are part of the unicorn journey. And there's a question here about that question about becoming a unicorn. But is there, can you guys share a hard time or a hard situation that you were wrestling with, whatever you can share publicly, and how you got through that in the journey of building Zoom? Yeah, essentially, three or three to tell me. I think over the past seven years, from time to time, we always struggle on many things, on many fronts. Early on, as I mentioned, it's really hard to risk capital. That's probably the first to struggle. And the second thing, I have a team, start up with a long journey. How can you make sure everyone, they are patient. To keep dilemma happiness to customers, it's also, we had to convince those, especially for the young people. I think at a different time, and I have a different struggles. Again, even recently, I also have all kinds of things, so we need to worry. But do you enjoy that? That's okay. Okay. I can talk about another struggle that I had with Zoom, and I ended up learning a lot with Eric. In this Silicon Valley, where everyone's starting companies, there's always this expectation that, as you grow the company, you're going to be hiring different executives from other companies who've done this, been there, they have the credibility. And that seems to be the playbook. You start a company in the enterprise sector, you want to hire people from Salesforce, you want to hire people from BALT, you want to hire people from ServiceNow, and I came in with that mindset into Zoom. And Eric taught me that there's another way to build great companies. And the way Zoom built an incredible team is by bringing in people who worked incredibly hard, and who were passionate like Eric was when he started the company. They were not doing it for the title. For a very long time, we didn't have sea level executives at Zoom. They were all head off, even until the company went public. It was like the head of marketing. And Janine was running everything. She would have been like a CMO at any other company, but she didn't care about that. She cared about Zoom. And Eric gave the right people, the right opportunity, and this people delivered incredibly well. And they were able to grow with a company. And they are still adding a lot of value. And for me, that was a great lesson, but I struggled initially because I felt that everyone was hiring the who's who and we were not, but we were hiring the right people. Can you guys speak a little bit more to that? Because it feels like that is something that's very unique and novel for the journey and success of Zoom. Is that both in funding, Eric, it was a people-driven decision. And then also, Eric, in the culture that you've built, it's been focused, it sounds like on the qualities of the individuals more than their resumes or their backgrounds. And so can you speak to any key tactics that you've done to create this culture where people want to work hard for you or how do you identify those people that will be outperformers if you can't look at their resumes and their backgrounds and what they've done in the past? Yes, so, Robert, that's a great question. Thank you. Thank you for sharing that. That's exactly the overall tactics. The reason why is for any startup companies, it's a long journey. You really cannot think about a 203 or 4 or 5 years, you can achieve something when we started Zoom 2011. Our first thought of the milestone in terms of this is success is 10 years. It's a long journey. But do not a journey. If you hire someone, it's great a background. In the already very successful other companies, do you think they are going to stay with you for like another 10 years? Our tactics is more like, we want to, you know, hire those people with a greater potential. They want to learn by also self-motivating. I knew the scenario would be everyone at Zoom, myself, included. We can grow ourselves to the next level. We can become a better version of ourselves along with the common goals. That's what those employees, they tend to be very loyal. That's really important. All of us, within a long journey, 4 or 5 years later, some employees, especially successful and other companies, or 4 or 5 years, I still do not think anything. They might quit. You don't want to have those employees. That's why even instead of a strategy goal, promote some may not be ready. But as long as they want to learn, I think that should be okay. That's our philosophy. But I mean, I'm not saying that's the perfect. So it's also full of challenges. Like suddenly you have a pandemic crisis. Again, it's what our leaders, myself, included all employees, they cannot agree with themselves with a 30 times more traffic. Then you'll probably look back and say, you should have high sound when you did it at a beautiful. Again, this is also learning curve files as well. We have a question about work life balance. You both have kids. You both have amazing careers. Eric, you were just telling us about how it's you're working even still harder now, even though Zoom has had all the successes that it has. How do you do that? And do you have to sacrifice your personal lives? And if not, what's the secret? Sandy, do you want to start? I don't believe that much in work like balance. I believe in loving your job. And if you love your job, then everything is more fluid. And I'm working like Saturday, Sundays, at night, during the day. Now I get to see my kids a lot because I'm at home. And I never think about I'm going to work from 95 and then see my kids. I loved doing what I do. I mean, I love doing this. I love working with the entrepreneurs. I love helping them build their companies sharing what we've seen in the past. So I feel that if I need to start thinking about work like balance, something that I'm doing is wrong. I'm not doing the job that I should be doing. Yeah, I think I sent you right on. That's right. You see that Sandy and I have a great chemistry, right? It's so well, it was young. Also, I also had similar questions every time. You know, when I talk to other leaders, you know, or maybe my mentors, I want to ask you how do you balance your work life? You know, finally, I realized as long as I think about a balance that's going to the direction that no way to balance between working life. You've got to do family or passion. The work in life, life or work, you've got to enjoy that. Then if there's a conflict, you're in the work and your family and life, guess what? Family first. I think. So that's also, we talked about a lot at Zoom, right? You know, you've got to enjoy what you're doing. Doing a single balance. If that's conflict, always focus on your family. That's a part. Yeah, I think that's it's a great way of looking at it. I think also if you follow your passion, it's energizing and you're better to everybody around you when you're energized as well. Terrific. We have a question here around, for Santi around barriers to being a Latin VC due to stigma or prejudice. Do you feel like there's prejudice or stigma and where is it from? Is it if it does exist? I do think it still exists. Initially, it bothered me a lot, but there's a lot that I can't control. So now I don't even pay attention to that. I remember at first, people were inviting me to like football games and not my football. That's like a different football. It's the American football. My football is soccer. And I was like, okay, this is not my thing. But I felt that I had to go. Now I just don't do that. I am who I am. And I embrace who I am. And to be honest, I feel that I was lucky to meet Eric and be part of the story because of my different background. After we invested, I tried to introduce Eric to other VCs. They wouldn't even take the meeting because again, it's video conference. It's like it's done. But I could see that. So I believe that we we all need to embrace who we are. And those differences are going to make us better and happier. And then what you can't control, just let go. It's like the competition question. It's like why focus on the competition? Why focus on what people are saying? Just focus on what you can control. And so as your advice, if somebody else is facing discrimination or stigma to try to convince those people that are giving him or her the discrimination to convince them that they're wrong or just to let them go and find the ones that listen. So discrimination comes at different levels. So it depends on what type of discrimination people are going through. But in my case, when people told me Latinos can't get into venture, they don't do that. I just found that people who believed that it doesn't matter if you're from Latin America, from Europe, from Asia. It's like they get to know you as a person and they get past the accent. And you find those people and I found those people. And there are a lot of people, this Silicon Valley so diverse, you have people from all over the world. So just find the people that you want to hang out with. Did you have any fear about stigma as with English as your second language? I actually know a lot of students and founders that actually have that as a real fear. And they don't start a company or become CEO because they think that they're English is not as good as a native born English speaker. Was that at all in your mind or is that even a concern that people should think about? Not at all. No fear at all. Because what I think is inside it right now, why there are so many good people, good entrepreneurs, maybe there's in Silicon Valley. I think nobody is perfect. Everyone has the strengths and the weakness. And why you need to have so many fears? Why it folks on your strengths? And it folks on passion. And fear will not have you anything. It's just that new your weakness. I have a plan to improve and enjoy that. I think that's, let's go into it. If you're perfect, you are not giving to type of courage to do a lot of things. That's a one for the reasons you got to work harder. Like keeping improving to become a better word of yourself. Fear will not have. I love this lesson. I'm just putting attention on purpose and passion. We're going to end gang with just any final comments that you want to share to your 20 to yourselves when you were 20 years old. So if you took yourself back to when you were 20, is there any advice that you would want to have imparted to your 20-year-old self? Yes, so Sandy, if you don't mind, maybe it can start. I think the two things I can't, if I can, and if I tell the 20 of them, I'm really worried about myself is, I do, I should know the purpose of life earlier. The earlier and the student, the purpose of life, the better for many things, otherwise looking back, I just wasted a lot of time, energy, a lot of things, looking back at the stupid and this is the first thing. The second thing is, as long as they have a dream, I think it's just a, just a do it. By the neck is a mantra, just a do it. I think it's very important, and even if you are not ready, just a do it. You plan to learn a lot on that return. Thank you, Eric. Sandy. Two things as well for me. One of them is, I would have spent more time with my parents, both of them passed away when I was young, and I think I took them for granted growing up. So that's what I encourage people to do, spend time with their family, because you never know what's going to happen. And the second thing, I would have moved to Silicon Valley earlier, without taking so many detours. And I ended up getting here, as one of those journeys, you don't know where you're going to go. But how do I know Silicon Valley existed? I should have moved here early, because this is what I find, the people that just inspire me to learn. Every day, I learn something new. And when I learn, my kids know it. They feel that I'm energized. After this call, I'm going to be having dinner with them, and I'm going to be super excited. And they'll know that I had a great call. That's great. Well, thank you both. I think we all had a great call. I think we're all energized. So thank you, Eric. Thank you, Sandy. On behalf of STBVP, the students, and the public YouTube community. Thank you. There's lots of virtual Zoom love for you guys, but everybody's on mute right now, so you won't be able to feel it. But thank you guys. That was great. Thank you, Robbie. Thank you for having us. Thank you. Thank you. The entrepreneurial thought leader, Syrians, is a Stanford E-Corner original production.
