 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. One Andreas Fontaine has degrees in economics from the University of Catolica of Chile and from the University of Chicago. He's been a research director at the Central Bank of Chile, a professor at some of the major universities in Chile, and a visiting professor at UCLA. He has been the Minister of Economy Chile for only six months. So we actually today have an opportunity to influence him as we ask him some questions and give him some guidance about what he can do to change the country. Without further ado, minister. Thank you. Thank you Tina for this invitation, this opportunity to address all these people here. Young talents that are going to change the world, I think in the future. And thank you for the opportunity to be inaugurating this excellent auditorium. Well let me first say a few words about myself. I'm not an entrepreneur, I've never started a company. I'm a public policy guy basically. I've been trained as an economist and I've worked and have the fortunate actually to participate in two crucial instances in the recent history of Chile. One was 25 years ago when we had had a very big crisis and I was able to work there in the team that actually solve the situation and help Chile to take off and have a very successful performance in the next years. And then again this time I've been called to serve in the government with a clear mandate to help draw policies that would increase productivity and get Chile to become a developed country during this decade. I think that the president, Pineda, has said for us. So this is very challenging. You may be, we have different generations of course and some of you may think as a bit distant this idea of this love for public policies. You are more private oriented people. In my generations we used to think that to change the world you had to make a revolution. Some people around here were basically wearing flowers in their heads and trying to make the revolution through peace and love. Others around the world were doing less peaceful things to change the world and all those experienced fail actually. But we get very moved for us in the generation for finding ways of through public policy changing the world. And I have the fortunate of doing that in a sense in Chile, of participating in this creation of a new way of managing Chile is sort of a start up for the nation which has the orientation of actually widening the room for people to innovate. So instead of changing the world through revolution to change the world through innovation which is what you see here in Silicon Valley very easily. So going for a bit for the presentation, well I come from Chile and probably not many of you are familiar with Chile. Chile is a small country, 16, 17 million people. The size of the GDP measures in equivalent dollars is more or less the size of Singapore or Ireland, Portugal around this number is more or less the size of the total size of the economy. But of course our per capita income is much below those other countries. So that's why we are classifies as an upper middle income. We are reaching exports of copper, fruit, wine and things that are there. And we are famous for our interesting things as Palo Neruda, Israel and so on. That's the country where I came from. And this is our recent history in which we had this period from around 1970 to around 1985 which many awful things happened in Chile. And the economy was basically chopped on a low growth path, right by inflation. And of course people were frustrated and that tend to create the wrong kind of answers. So policies instead of actually opening up the room for innovation, creativity and so on were very interventionistic and tended to make things worse. We had a big crisis I mentioned in the mid 80s which has some similarities to the crisis the US has and they gone in the last couple of years. And then we had that take off which was engineered by a number of policies in which I worked from the central bank basically as a macro economist there. And we had that very strong growth for about 12 years growing at around 8% to year. And up to the point there when we got to the Asian crisis, Chile has a lot of connections with Asia because we are about 40% of our exports go to Asia. So when the Asian crisis hit the Asia, well, he does also quite strongly. And we had that slow down in growth and in productivity that you see there. And so after those 12 years of very fast growth as if we got tired and we got 12 years of what we call the CES period in which actually productivity tended to stagnate. And as I mentioned the mission we have is to speed up growth through increasing productivity growth and to achieve this stage of or to cross the threshold of development during this decade. That would mean to increase our per capita income from $15,000 to about 23 by the end of the decade which would put us at the level of the lowest developed countries these days which is the level that Portugal has for example or the Czech Republic is close to that to the purple column there would be our target. Not to get to that level we have to increase the rate of growth of the economy to about 6% per year. So we are starting on the right track in the sense this year we are going to grow close to 5.5% after having a very terrible earthquake at the beginning of the year. So that of course affects initially the first half of the year has been very much affected by that. But we are speeding up and estimations are that we are going to get to grow at around 6% and a half percent next year. So we are in the right track and we feel we have all the potentialities of actually accelerating growth because as I mentioned 40% of our experts go to Asia. Asia of course is a very fast growing region these days. We produce many of those commodities for which the Asian countries lack. And we are for obviously is very connected with Latin American countries with Brazil for example which is another fast growing countries these days. The Brazilian tide is going to lift all Latin American boats and we are going to benefit for that. Chilean companies have become very globally oriented among our main exporters. We have top of the world exporters in copper, in salmon, in wine, in wood pulp. And we have some other companies that have become sort of leaders in this so-called multi-latin companies that are investing in many Latin American countries in retail, in airline and other sectors. We have this new company starting. But we think we need to accelerate this process. That's a 6% growth that would take us by the end of the decade to become a developed country. We accelerate that growth what we need is to foster innovation and entrepreneurship. And that's what we are setting at number of policies that go in that direction that would basically try to get Chile to be the innovation hub of South America by interconnecting us with the innovation centers of the world and of course the most important of all Silicon Valley. That's why we have the underlying that connection. We are doing a number of things to actually get to this result. One of them I can answer the specific questions other subjects but what we are doing is this start-up program that's going to connect Chile with California. Which is in the line of actually exploding this long history of interconnection between Chile and California. Which as you know are very similar in terms of landscape as you have the more or less the same kind of deserts, the same kind of vineyards, the same kind of coastline. They are amazingly similar. So our aim is to replicate the similarity in terms of landscape, now in terms of economics and innovation. And who knows perhaps 30 or 50 years from now Chile is going to be as California is today with the help of innovators. And we are going to try to bring those innovation to Chile. To do that we have this start-up Chile program in which we are attracting young talented entrepreneurs probably after finishing or graduating here or in other universities of the world to go to Chile to do the early stages of their innovation in Chile. And we are facilitating the process, granting some money for a six months period and other facilities in order for them to settle there. Why to do that? Because we think that in order to get this innovation culture going in Chile we need to create a critical mass of people doing this and to have these strong connections with the innovation centers of the world. So you are all invited to apply to this program when you finish your studies and thank you for your patience. That was a fabulous setup and I have got a whole bunch of specific questions. I actually am lucky enough that I got to spend six weeks in Chile at the end of the year. I got to know the country pretty well, I got to travel pretty broadly and was totally enchanted by the country. And I am wondering for you as a new government official what levers do you have to make changes in the country? I mean obviously there are some things that you can control and there are some things you can't. What are the types of things you are trying to do and what levers do you have to control them? Well as you know Tina is the innovation or entrepreneurship ecosystem. You have many parts of it. What we can control relatively easily is the legal and governmental policies and we are doing that in terms of for example lifting regulatory and bureaucratic barriers to entrepreneurship. There are many of them. You know politicians typically do as part of their job create these kind of barriers and regulations and so on and we have to be careful to some of them are necessary of course. But others are just useless and what to eliminate them. We are doing that on a very consistent way. We are also trying to review visa procedures. For example the experience here of course is that immigration is a very powerful source of innovation and we want to welcome immigration to Chile but in order to do that in a practical way we have to actually review the visa procedures. There are a number of things that are sort of we are doing. True effect. Now when you look at Silicon Valley what things inspire you here? What things do you hope to replicate? Obviously you came here with a lot of your colleagues you have been here many times before. What are the things that you look at as models to your boy? I would really like to replicate this back at home. Well what I see here is that very powerful and productive combination of academia, of high level science and entrepreneurial spirit. The way to make that combination is what we want to do really. We do have good scientists in Chile for example. We do have good entrepreneurs but there is not that much of a connection between the two. What we want to replicate is that to have Chile become an innovation hub in South America. So what are you doing to make that happen? Well as I mentioned some things are related to connecting with other successful centers as Silicon Valley. We are bringing entrepreneurs here and taking young entrepreneurs to Chile. We are attracting IT companies to locate in Chile. We are attracting centers of excellence to locate in Chile through government support. In addition to the standard government support for education, scholarships abroad with a large program of scholarship abroad in Chile and defending for R&D. Great. Now there are a lot of things that we know makes Silicon Valley a really successful place for entrepreneurs and people who want to bring their ideas to life. One of them is that there is a real tolerance for failure and people know that if they try something if they take a risk and it doesn't work out that that's not the end. That they're going to have many other opportunities to try again. Tell us a little bit about that culture in Chile. Is this something that is the same or different? Well there we have problems. The sort of problems that are not that easy to tackle because there's a deep cultural problem. There is some distrust in Chile and so people tend to think that when someone fails it was committing a fraud or it was actually it has intention to actually fail. That's a typical suspicion. That's to be overcome gradually I think. In the meantime what we're doing though is to which can be done is to change the bankruptcy law. Our bankruptcy law creates a problem and that says because it's very easily from a standard bankruptcy procedure to become charged for fraud. And that of course then to exaggerate this is kind of social stigma on people that go through failure. Great. It sounds like it's something you're thinking about. Yes, yes, very much indeed. Great. Now, there are other things that are very important in this culture here. What is that we have a strong venture capital, your risk capital investments. You are willing to put money down on ideas that are really, really new, that are really pretty risky. Does that exist in Chile? Yes. We have a young venture capital industry that is supported by the core for the development agency of the government and it is working. They have money, they have close to $300 million not yet invested because they complain that there are no enough projects or not enough entrepreneurs in Chile. Although some entrepreneurs complain the other way around. So we have the elements there. I tend to think in general, venture capital is very important clearly but one that has to be clear in this, I think that actually money follows good ideas and it's not the other way around. So the crucial thing is to have the good ideas. When you have the good idea, money is going to come in. And we do have a capital market at this cable of doing that, I think, partially. And of course there is a world market also that we can access to Silicon Valley or to World Street or whatever and get financing there. Great. So the key thing is that this area is known for is having lots and lots of role models. Local role models. You can look around this room and see lots of people probably who have started companies in our midst right here. And so you can clearly see the people look like you, boy, you look like me, you sound like me, you've been in my classes. If you did it, I can do it too. And people are also very generous in sharing their insights and their experience and their network. Are there those type of role models there? Is it can people look and say, wow, this person did it, I can do it too. We certainly have them. We have not exploited the role models so much. But we're working on that. And this mission, myself here with my team, we brought here 11 entrepreneurs which are in the initial stages of their process which we think they have a high impact or likely to have a high potential. And we would like to have them being those to become those models. So we're doing that. I got a chance to meet them this morning. They were really impressive. So I think so too. But one of the big issues that comes up is that people often don't understand that they're really different types of entrepreneurship. There's necessity entrepreneurship. Those people who go out and start a business that supports their family and it's very limited in its potential. And then there's those who are sort of opportunity entrepreneurs who start things that are very scalable and have a potential to really grow quite large. Do people differentiate between that? Do you differentiate? Do you have a goal to develop one versus the other? Well, there's nothing wrong with the first variety in the sense of, of course, small businesses are needed and so on. So we'll have that happening anyway and we are lifting barriers to foster the creation of businesses, to starting up businesses in Chile. But of course, the real growth of the economy, the growth of protein is going to come from companies that don't have a vocation to remain small. Exactly the opposite. They have a vocation to grow and to grow not only in Chile but also abroad. So the second kind of entrepreneurs is the ones who would like the most. Great. I mean, I know that a lot of companies, especially in small countries, try to be global from the get-go. Is that something that these companies are doing that you talk about? These new entrepreneurs, are they starting up with the mind that their company is a global business even from the day they start? Well, that's the idea. And that's happening in a sense because we are a very small market and a very open economy. We have trade agreements with about 50 countries, we have very low importities. So it's a fully, outward oriented economy. So it's very natural for an entrepreneur born in Chile to be thinking of exploring. Okay, so let's look at the other side around though. One of the benefits of being in Silicon Valley is this huge influx of people from all over the world with different ideas, with different cultures, with different, all different resources they bring in. In fact, if you look around this room, it looks like the UN, right? We've got people here from all over the world. When I go to Chile, I don't see that. So is that something that you see as a challenge to, instead of having people in Chile looking outward to the rest of the world, to have the rest of the world coming to Chile? Well, we welcome that happening. And as we start growing fast and having investments coming and demand for high qualified professionals and things that sort, we are going to get, I think, that influx of people coming to Chile. We do have it at a small rate these days, but it's going to increase significantly the thing in the future. We are attracting, for investment, we are attracting IT companies to settle in Chile, and that's going to create that movement. We have to review, as I said, the visa procedures, we have a bit, always, some problems there, and we are working on those. But clearly, we think that the consequence of this strategy is going to be to change the mixture of Chile people you saw in the streets in Chile, to resemble more of what we see here. Great. Terrific. Now, you talk about visa issues. There are all these little things that end up having a really big impact on people's ability to show up there, and then essentially turn their ideas into companies. What are the variables that you are thinking about? Are there things that actually work better and should we even hear? Are there things that you go, wow, this is something I should really advertise that we've got these resources that actually don't exist anywhere else? Well, first of all, as I said, we are situated in a location that is very unique to exploit the growth of the emerging world. And we think growth is going to come in the near future from the emerging world, both Asia and South America, or Latin America. Second, we have a very open, free market environment that is good for starting businesses. And third, we have low costs, which of course helps a lot. So in comparison with Silicon Valley, it's a variable in Scroocia. We are much lower cost producer or in many services, and that helps to foster businesses there. And now, I know you are launched this really interesting new initiative, the Startup Chilli, to entice folks from around the world to start their companies in Chile. I think it's really a bold move. So maybe you could tell us a little bit about what this is about. What do people get? I mean, if I decide I want to come to Chile and start my company there, what are you going to give me? What we are doing is to offer $40,000 for people that go to Chile, that's a grant, they get that grant for doing their early stages of their project in Chile. And we have them with the other facilities, offices, and things are sort to settle there. And the condition they have to comply, they have to have the project to be approved by a board, so we have to apply for that approval. And they have to be there and interact with Chilean entrepreneurs to give a few talks of what they are doing, because what we want to get from this is the interaction, the critical mass that creates interaction between Chilean entrepreneurs and this. And the entrepreneurs we are bringing from the rest of the world. And to do that, we did that kind of conversation to take place. And the only thing we want is that these entrepreneurs probably are going to, after they spend six months or a year in Chile, they are going to move here or some other place. And we want them to get connected to Chile. And the best way to actually get this interconnection with this innovation centers of the world that I was mentioning is through people. In the end, this is basically a matter of getting to know the other people. And this is a way to do it. That's what we want to get to. So it's a nice way of inviting people down there and spend some time and get to know the country. Now, let's change gears a little bit. I mean, here we are in a university. And I know that I spend a lot of time with the universities in Chile. And I'm curious what is happening in the universities there to stimulate this type of thinking? Because certainly, we have a room full of students here who are thinking about what can I learn in the classroom and extracurricular programs that will give, prepare me to enter this entrepreneur world. What's happening in the universities in Chile to make that happen? Well, we do have good universities in terms of the training, the quality of the professors are good, the curriculum. But they have been focused basically on sciences or other typical subjects, not that much on training in entrepreneurship. And with your help, Tina and others, they are now focusing that. And that's a revolution that is happening in Chilean universities these days. And that's going to change probably the curriculum. But also, the way the professors see their role. Because we are not used, for example, having science professors thinking in terms of patents of research or of engineering professors, things in terms of startups. That's something I've been new for us. But that's going to be changing these days. Great. So what sort of things do you want your students to learn? What would you hope they would come out of school knowing or prepared to do? Well, that depends on the subject, of course. No, no, but related to innovation and entrepreneurship. Well, basically, to have this frame of mind that actually gets them to think in terms of problems that have to be solved. And that is a value of actually finding out the way to solve the problem and to be willing to take the risks to provide the benefits of that and bond the costs of the provincial failure. That kind of entrepreneurial frame of mind is what we want to teach, basically. Great. I'm going to open it up to questions from the audience. Okay, it looks like we've got the first one over here. Hello. First of all, I want to give a big ass comment back on myself. I'm actually two years ago for my lucky teacher. And I came to study here at the National Graph. So I've actually got into experience a lot of the youth. Well, I've got to, I know a lot of the youth mentality in both places. In the second, my friends here, it's not a question. And in Chile, I was actually during the summer, this summer, went through Chile. I worked in the ESC, I don't know that. And got to interact with the engineering students here and engineering professors. And one thing that strikes me about the two cultures, the Silicon Valley culture and the Chile culture. Well, first of all, engineering people here go into what you would, it's more common to go into electrical engineering, bioengineering, computer science engineering and not traditional areas of engineering. Whereas in Chile, most engineering majors are going into industrial engineering, which would be equivalent of management science and engineering, which is great because it's country needs great managers and stuff. So the youth doesn't have this mentality of developing new technologies in Chile. Whereas I have many friends here, we're already thinking of ideas and there is some more year of college, second year of college, are already thinking of technological ideas to make the world a better place. Right, that's a terrific observation. Do you have a question? That's a terrific observation, I'm wondering if you have a question. No, no, it's really a good question. And I feel that's just because it's not a thing that professors can teach. It's a thing that those students get from the student body. Do you think there is something that the Chile government can do to change some and how are you in the youth? Well, if we were discussing the role of role models, it's exactly that one, actually, actually create that example and then motivate people to do that, to become innovators in those areas. But I share the view that we have that weakness and we are working on that to solve that. My question would be if you went to other universities around the United States, would it be different? Is Stanford unique in the United States or is it something that you would find anywhere around the country? So that would be something that... Oh, good. Great. Another question, back there. Russia is currently also trying to rebuild or replicate so-called the Silicon Valley. Have you learned or Chilean anyway working or looking at what they're doing to try to modify your system? Well, it's a different kind of strategy. It's sort of a top-down strategy which you find that has a project and a settle a piece of land that develops the buildings and so on and try to create the physical resembles of Silicon Valley. We're not actually wanting to replicate Silicon Valley would be useful. It would be useless that what we're doing is to try to interconnect, to improve the way people move from these two places. And through that means basically fostering entrepreneurship in Chile. Anything sort of approach I would say. Great. Over here? Yep. Hey, there. So even the active larger number of business areas are risk and the Chilean culture has been changed a lot in order to embrace this technology. Why is it that people are so interested in replicate Silicon Valley and not perhaps partying some color-cancer topic that is more perhaps of the resources and the culture in Chile? Well, I would say that the Chileans are particularly risk-averse. First of all, we're a mining country. Mine cycles and they're awfully price-oscillate a lot and so there is a lot of risk in being a miner. And we, because of the different reasons of our history, have been a very unstable country in the past. Businessmen in Chile are very used to live and somehow learn to prosper in a very risky environment. It's only that we have to redirect now the kind of sectors in which they would have to invest. Our natural resources, for example, take the case of agriculture or of fishing are the kind of activities that need a lot of, or they are, can attract a lot of innovations in terms of genetic engineering and things about sorts. For example, biotech has a very natural place in Chile, I would say. How do you think the Chilean people are in the same task of growing business countries? How do you think that we get a turn in the domestic industry in getting the company for a common economy? No, I don't think that would be a problem. We're a very open economy. We are used to compete in the world in terms of our products. We tend to be, I think, quite friendly with visitors and foreign people coming to Chile. So I don't think that would be much of a problem, really. So a lot of countries are getting the harmony of the idea of collaborative consumption, which third-party companies are encouraging their users to share items, and books, accommodations, bicycles, cars, stuff like that. What is Chilean stands on collaborative consumption? Nothing to it. To my knowledge, to be honest. Do you think there would be a economy in, like, wouldn't be a battle or to introduce that market into Chile? From the government perspective. Could be. From the government perspective, these days is not a priority. But it could be in the future. I think what she's getting at, can I restate this a little bit, is that there's a tremendous interest in doing things that are environmentally friendly, and environmentally sustainable. And as you're building a new sort of economy, is that something that's important to you? Can I sort of... I have always been saying about the things that your family are interacting as a group to proliferate and idea at the top of the country. How surfacing, where you get a bunch of people together and sharing things, you know, partner and your eighties and others. Well, to some extent, countries that are not as developed as this one, that happens naturally. That's part of... That's the way of surviving when you're poor, you know, is to share things. But in the case of... Regarding environmental concerns, of course, in the case of energy, we are looking at ways of non-conventional energy sources and things that sort with the... that are going to be more environmentally friendly. Great. Yep. The Silicon Valley here, and like innovation center in India, which is very known as the National Map, are pretty naturally and organically created. Like they came up on their own and actually with government support. Initially, you're trying to, like, through government support, make this happen. Do you think it's like a temporary phase, that while government fuels, that while the government function money will grow, and once stops a different phase of love, it appears how you're tackling that problem. Well, actually, we're not pumping much money. This is not a government go top-down program of spending large amounts of the budget in terms of R&D or certain sectors, whatever. What we are, is sort of a surgical intervention we are doing. We are trying to remove certain bottlenecks, barriers, things that are sort of that are somehow creating the problem. And to unleash the natural entrepreneurial speed, we think it's there, in Chile. That's basically what we are trying to do. Great. Yes. Since the investments always go to the highest return in China, Chile has a very rich resources like copper, and copper has... ...prices has gone to historical high. So, you mentioned you don't pump in from money into a high tech sector. But how come you have this kind of natural high tech industry without government support, even if you have some kind of resource curse? Well, we have significant non-corpor activities like agriculture, like fishing, like others, salmon industry, for example, and all those in order to survive in an environment that is very competitive in the world, in which costs, even in Chile, are raising a bit because of the currency effects of the copper boom, and so on. They need to innovate and increase the productivity through this, introducing technological advances. So, with the scenario, is there for this happening? Great. My name is Gabriel Alain, I'm China, and I'm here at the Everybody's Director here. As you mentioned, we have a lot of similarities in California until one of which is not very nice, is the separate. And so, also, we mentioned we were hit by the fifth largest airport in the world history by the ferry. And even though we're quite well, we still have a economic loss close to 20 to 30 million dollars. So, I was wondering, what are we doing in the third floor? Bringing innovation from here to Chile, and getting that fear we have, amazing, perfect, engineering, satellite, the one that I'm studying. Have you been something formal? Well, probably something's going on that I'm not too familiar with, but let me say that I think that our construction, engineering in Chile did very well after the quake, because after having such a strong earthquake, 8.8 degrees, one of the fifth strongest in the world, the amount of destruction is amazingly low, actually. Those numbers of 20 or 30 billion dollars, well, looks highest and I'm measuring dollars, but the percentage of the capital stock of Chile is not that large. So, actually, we did well, I think. And in terms of the rebuilding of the country, of course, as you probably know, every earthquake teaches a lot of lessons and we are benefiting from them. And in addition to that, something that sounds strange, but actually it's going on, the earthquakes help to increase productivity, because when you rebuild, you rebuild better structures than the ones you will previously had. So, productivity is going to increase because of that, I think. Thank you, Mr. Actually, I've got four questions. You can have one question. There are lots of questions. So, when you are talking about a Turkey, countrymen, some other countries, one problem, they may face is cultural strike. So, ideally, any measure to assist them to integrate into local culture, for example, political environment, cultural environment, legal environment, the style of things. Well, yes, this problem we have in IT companies that want to locate in Chile to offer global services. They do it in connection with core for the development agency in Chile. And they get some help of that sort. And to that, we have a large professional community in Chile that is used to work with for investors, because we have a country that has a lot of for investments. So, also that naturally takes place in a sense that they find a way to get some help. I focus on the students. From your perspective, as you work to low and very messy, all of this stuff, you see that. What advice do you have for the California government? I don't know much about California to give advice. The barrios have interest to for food. Intervisants, right? I don't know really what other barrios here. What we do see in Chile is that the process, because of political process, the political process tend to create a lot of regulations. Some of them are useful. Some of them just create artificial barriers for entry into new businesses, or to start new investments and so on. And we are trying to lift them. You know, the World Bank is doing business ranking, compares countries across the world. We have been declining in that ranking. We lost about nine positions in the last year. So we have to make up for that, to solve that problem by improving there. The US, as a whole, is of course very well ranked in that ranking. Great. We have a question in the middle. Thank you very much for being here. We will listen to some measures that you will try to apply next year to get started. So I want to ask you about the specific targets. I mean, specific ratios or measures you will be working at them over the next year, just to evaluate the program and say, it's been a success or failure? Well, regarding specifically the start-up program, that's a tough question, because actually since the results are going to be seen in the long term, we are going to have a problem there of establishing a criteria or a metric for success. But the general idea is to create this innovation culture that creates innovation that is valued by the market, that has a value in the market. And one way to measure that, that simple metric, is to look at the number of companies, Chilean-born companies that are traded in NASDAQ for example. That's a very simple metric. Today is zero. So you see, the starting position is zero. And the, what this is, a target, we have been mentioning and setting for the Chilean business community. And let's see how many of you are able to develop a company that is going to end up being traded in NASDAQ. And for, and in the case of the start-up Chile program, we are going to claim that the ideas that have been developed from those guys that went to Chile in the start-up programs are Chilean companies. Great. Any questions over here? I'm from Mexico. I know I was just looking, I'm from Mexico, and I was just working on our subject for the Ministry of the Federal Community in Mexico. And we were asking us in the slides arrow, and I think that in the last event, what were the bottom-backs for innovation? We were just keeping them some, I thought. But I was wondering what is the Ministry of the Federal Community in Chile? To support, or to increase the length between universities and the industries, in order to create a team and talk about that, you're going to bring all these tariffs. Well, many, many things, but we have a program that is supporting, giving financial support for centers of excellence, international centers, that set that locating Chile. And they do that on a joint venture with Chilean university, and they provide services, basically, to the business community. So that's one way we are doing it. Another one is that we have a tax credit system in which the companies get the tax credit if they do their R&D with universities or research agencies in general. So that's again something we're doing. We're also working, trying to help the universities to somehow push them to look at patents and their patent system as a very important piece of the puzzle. And they are starting to do it. So that's another idea. So we're doing a lot of things, so that's all. The answer to being at Silicon Valley is an open-door ship hub. Is that certainly an economic hub, but also an open hub? Now, by wanting to, essentially, build that open-door spirit in Chile, are you really interested in the act in, essentially, prioritizing the economic side, the technological side, or I mean, do you work hard to make Chilean economic center or are you trying to build both technology and infrastructure? Well, basically, we want Chile to be center of the application of ideas to create value. And those ideas may come from technological advances or may come just to the employment of the technological advances that are already there in a way that nobody has thought before. Both things, actually. What does Chile have in terms of government research funds? I would like to see that. This Chile haven't turned into government research funds. The United States, the government, spends a lot of money. We have a lot of government labs, a lot of money goes into universities to develop technologies. Most of the graduate students here, in one way, are funded by the government, and by the graduates who used to be an engineer and science. I think most people here agree that for the same value, I just see results of many things, but government labs, and fellow labs, for example, have lived more national labs and Stanford and the USie Berkeley, large labs, large friends, like government, what does Chile have in them? Well, we do have sort of a national science foundation in Chile that has been granting money for research for the last 30 years. Of course, scale is different from what you have here, but we do have that that supports research on a competitive basis, and we want to expand that in Chile. In addition to that, we have a tax credit for companies doing R&B, and we want to expand also that. Great. Question? I have a question about a specific type of innovation, it's hard for your innovation, I'm not sure how for your work. For your work? For your innovation, the second idea is basically to bring down products to the basic needs as a piece, and your second innovation has really been emerging and creates successful innovations for China and India, and it's the type of innovation that doesn't work for the future. We have to take a look at the three of them, it's more focused on our solutions. Our conversation with our concentration about showing how the community is working, all of you, career, experience, how do you think about our solutions? Well, I'm not very familiar with those. Sorry about that. I'll follow you later. Yes. I'm just going to repeat the question for those folks on the podcast is that where is the $40,000 per venture coming from? And basically, what sort of return on that investment are you expecting? Well, this is a pilot program, we have a limited amount of money that we are devoting for this. So people are going to compete for this and we are going to see what happens. The pilot works well, we are going to scale it, and we are going to look for probably private money to actually expand it. And what would the return be? As I said, it's not something very tangible in itself. But we are trying to develop the innovation culture. And we think that creating this critical mass of people doing innovation in Chile is going to help in that direction. And it's a small amount of money we are going to invest in this in terms of the total fiscal budget. We are very conservative fiscal people. We are not actually engaging in large public investment program regarding innovation and things are so. There is a very limited intervention to get the thing moving basically. Great. We are going to take one more question, Carolyn. You mentioned that Chile is looking at successful companies publicly traded as the measure of success. But you also said that Chile is trying to overcome this notion that failure isn't the bad thing. So how do you target for success but also try to foster tolerance for failure? Well, I see no contradiction because we know to get to be successful, you have to be willing to fail. Is that a concept that is acceptable in Chile right now? Well, we are trying to instill that culture in Chile. This is a working progress but we are moving in that direction. So my question is how are you trying to do that? Well, through the role models we talk about, through this interconnection with places like Silicon Valley, which that culture is already there, you can see it, you can sense it, through some legal changes and the bankruptcy law that we are going to change that tends to create that resistance or bias against taking risk. So there are a number of things where do we? Well, I just want to say I have been incredibly impressed with everything I have seen. The spirit of entrepreneurship and the faculty I have worked with there, the students I have met there. And also, as you showed in the pictures, the diversity of resources in Chile is totally remarkable. And the fisheries and the wineries and the agriculture and ecotourism, the minds. I mean, it is really quite amazing. And I can't wait to see what happens over the next years as you try all these experiments. I mean, you really are doing your being very entrepreneurial by trying these experiments. And we wish you the very best of luck. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Thank you. And this is the start-up to you. Thank you. Peaceful. Peaceful. Peaceful. Peaceful. Peaceful.
