 Who you are defines how you build. This is the OddProner of Thought Leader series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. On this episode we have Bology Shrinevason, CTO of Coinbase, a platform for buying, selling, and storing cryptocurrency. Previously Bology was the CEO of Earn.com, a general partner at Andrews and Horowitz, and the co-founder and CTO of Council, the Genetic Streaming Company. Here's Bology. Why do we think blockchain is the most important technology in this decade? Tom gave my bio, I won't belabor it, but basically currently CTO of Coinbase, part of that, sold a company to Coinbase Earn. Part of that, general partner at Andrews and Horowitz, maybe familiar with the firm. We also sold a company for about $375 million. This genomics company literally came out of BioX, down the street over there with my brother and a bunch of our friends. Basically, just a Stanford guy, through and through, so I kind of know your pain. So that's me. But never about me, let's talk about Bitcoin and blockchain. So I like this particular image because I think it motivates. This is a screen cap of Wireshark, and you can see the Bitcoin protocol literally as a protocol on screen. What's amazing about this is you can see that payments have been turned into packets. This is a transmission, this is a Bitcoin block. You can see the bytes over here. What's remarkable about this is what's absent. There's no HSBC, there's no Wells Fargo. There's no countries, there's no licenses or anything like that. What we have done is literally digitize the transmission of value. And if you think about how big a deal it was to digitize books and music and movies and newspapers and so on and so forth, the underlying technology behind blockchain allows us digitize now cash, stocks, bonds, mortgages, loans, derivatives, and all kinds of new things. Financial instruments that you haven't even thought of yet. So this is really like the motivating thing. Once we've got something into the realm of computer science, well, all you folks can go to town. So this is going to be a lot of fun in the next 10 years. All right, so I'm going to give, you know, basically 10 things about blockchain, 10 things about Coinbase and go through a fact and certainly answer all your questions. So just about Coinbase or about blockchain, I want to review Bitcoin, blockchain and Ethereum and then talk about Coinbase a little bit and do a Q&A. So first, you know, just for those folks, just a level set because I know there's varying backgrounds, I want to give the very, very, very basics. And in particular, this slide over here is if you only remember one slide and you don't want to remember anything else, this is the motivation behind why even invent Bitcoin in the first place, right? So you know, with physical cash, right, if I have a dollar bill and I hand Tom that dollar bill, there's an implicit property of the dollar bill, which is when A hands that dollar bill to B, A no longer has it and B has it, right? I had it, then now Tom has it. Anybody who's observing that can see, you know, that that physical bill was handed over. If I try to naively transplant that to the digital realm, okay, if I take the Federal Reserve serial numbers on that dollar bill and I just go and email them to Tom, okay, well, I still have a copy of those serial numbers and I can go and email them to somebody else, okay? And that is the fundamental issue with a naive representation of digital cash. It is the double spend problem. I could have spent those serial numbers with Tom and then with somebody else and somebody else. And so simply using serial numbers alone, that's not sufficient for basically scarcely in the digital realm. And so the way that we, until the invention of Bitcoin, the way that we represented digital cash was with a bank, right? Like a centralized actor that we trusted in the middle and this actor over here is where the scarcely enters the system, right? When A sends money to B digitally, C is trusted to debit A and to credit B, right? So this is where the scarcely enters the equation. And think about this is you're putting a lot of trust in C, right? They can debit and credit anybody. They can choose not to debit or credit. They can not, you know, allow a transaction to go through. And they can print billions of dollars for themselves. And so this is something which is, you know, ineligent from a computer science perspective to have a trusted central node if you can avoid it. And so with Stresche Nakamoto, this he came with D, decentralized digital cash. And so essentially this central actor, this bank, was replaced with a network of miners. And any one of those miners could approve that transaction, that debit or credit between A and B. And so since any one of them could approve it, one of them disapproving it, you know, all they would just do is be giving up some Bitcoin that they would have mined otherwise. It's basically a way to combine transaction approval and seniorage currency pretty in the same unit. So the details of this aren't super important, you know, like technically, you know, at least for a talk like this. But the concept is important, which is we took physical cash, we tried to naively turn into digital cash. That didn't work. So we tried to analyze actors and Bitcoin dispenses with those centralized actors by having anybody in theory who can connect to the internet with sufficient competition power can not approve transactions and push them through. So the cool thing about Bitcoin is once people understood this, once people understood what a breakthrough it was, they said, oh, well, you know, this data structure that these miners are updating, that blockchain, that fundamental innovation behind Bitcoin, that's essentially a tamper-resistant database for storing arbitrary things of value. You can use it for storing cash and you can use it for storing stocks and bonds and so on and so forth. But Bitcoin itself wasn't that easy to work with. It wasn't built for programming or it was actually, but Satoshi turned off a lot of the more sophisticated op codes early on just to keep it simple and attack-perfect. And so what happened was more recently, a new blockchain was launched in 2014 called Ethereum, about five years after launching Bitcoin. And to understand the improvement that Ethereum gives, here's an example of a script in Bitcoin which is almost like a simply language, it's like a stack-based language. And here's what Ethereum's salinity looks like, which is a little more like English or a job script or what have you. And this programmability led to a huge new surge in crypto activity and in 2017, it was this massive ICO boom. And this went up from on the order of tens of billions of dollars to many hundreds of billions of dollars and then down to a hundred billion dollars. But the thing about this is even though the ICOs came up and they went down, we think of it today, it's a winter for price but the summer for innovation. A lot of the stuff that got started back then is starting to work. For example, you've got decentralized prediction markets and decentralized loans and decentralized derivatives, that stuff is all starting to work. The winter for price, the summer for innovation. One thing that ICOs themselves, by the way, is they represent in my view the simultaneous disruption of venture capital, swift crowdfunding and cap tables. And I'll come back to that point but essentially you can invest in something internationally with a group at the same time and have all of the property rights recorded in the blockchain so anybody can see. It's such a big deal and so many innovations at once that people can sometimes lose a farce for the trees because they say, oh, what are you funding? You're funding all of this crazy stuff. But if you just look at this innovation in crowdfunding or in BC or Swiff for cap tables, it's actually a pretty big deal. This brings us to the present day. It was Bitcoin, then the blockchain, then Ethereum, ICO boom, and now the present day. The crypto winter, winter for price, summer for innovation. The way to think about the blockchain is the technology, it improves fundamental financial primitives. And one way to think about this is a blockchain, as I mentioned, it's a database for storing things of value and it started with cryptocurrency which is like digital gold. And more recently we've had these so-called ERC20s, these tokens which represent like equities. But you can also use it for other stuff. You can use it for non-fungible assets like so-called, it's very technical sounding, like in-game items, like swords and potions, baseball cards, collectibles, or even eventually piece of real estate. You can use it for representing identity and frankly you can use it for representing almost anything scarce. Anything scarce you can think of, you can represent in a blockchain. And you might say, well, why use a blockchain for things that are scarce? Well, once you've got a database that represents all the money in the world, the first thing someone's going to try to do is write themselves a million dollars. And so you have to actually say, well, first, I want that to be tamper resistant. Second, I don't want one party to be able to write themselves a million dollars. I want it to be decentralized, right? So that the power is split up. No one person can write themselves a million dollars. They might need more than a million dollars to write themselves a million dollars. And once you start thinking of those kinds of constraints, like a database that represents things of value, you start to be led to the kinds of properties that blockchains have. And once, of course, you can sell the problem of preventing someone from writing themselves a million dollars, you can stop them from writing themselves a million potions or a million acres or a million of anything else. So as I mentioned before, Bitcoin turned all this stuff into packets. They're literally protocols, Bitcoin, Ethereum, these things, that you can open up wire shark and see the raw packets that update the underlying blockchains. It's actually completely amazing when you think about that. Anybody who's on the internet can send and receive cryptocurrency back and forth. Just send packets back and forth. One consequence of this is there's another, people have talked about the unbanked and it's an important problem that I think crypto can solve in the long term. There's another group of unbanked which are machines. And we gave machines telephone numbers in the form of IP addresses. It used to be that you had to have a human who is associated with the telephone number. And when you give a machine an IP address, a machine can then autonomously communicate back and forth, right? And you do that all the time whenever you've written a bot that goes and interacts with Twitter or Scraper, like that spiders web and connects other computers autonomously. Autonomous machine communication was a really big deal. And we believe that autonomous machine transaction where machines can hold and send money on your behalf will likewise be a very, very big deal. Here is just a simple get up guest that string over there represents money. So if you can now transmit a string, you can transmit an arbitrary amount of value, which is pretty awesome. So a lot of the stuff in the late 90s that people talked about when they talked about intelligent agents or like bidding entities and so on, that's all actually starting to happen. And the primary context is which it's happening are things like exchanges, especially decentralized exchanges. You can go and write a program on your laptop that will literally make you money as you sleep by arbitrage these decentralized exchanges. I think over time in like the 10, 20, 30 year timeframe, every price on the internet, every Amazon.com product will have a cryptocurrency interface. So if you have some arbitrage strategy for like wool versus fleeced sweaters or whatever, you can actually arbitrage anything because everything will be priced in crypto. That's I think where the arbitrage stuff goes in the medium to long term. Okay. Fourth point. People talk a lot about the potential of blockchain and I do think it has a lot of potential. But it's actually something where in some ways it's overhyped but in some ways it's actually underhyped. That's to say there are fundamental financial primitives that the blockchain has already delivered like a 10x improvement on. I mean a quantifiable 10x. So the easy one, the obvious one is gold. So Bitcoin is infinitely lighter than gold. It's faster to transfer internationally. It's cheaper to custody. To give a concrete example of this, when the German Bundesbank tried to repatriate a bunch of gold from New York, it took them years to cost millions of dollars to bring back billions of dollars in gold. And while that might be an infrequent operation, it's an extremely important valuable operation that frankly underpins like a big chunk of the world economy. And if you've improved on that, that's a big deal, right? Gold is $2 trillion industry. If that was the only thing that blockchain ended up doing, that'd be a pretty big deal. But it's more than that. Tom's going to buy some Bitcoin now. So it's more than that. With Ethereum, and other kinds of cryptocurrency, that represents the 10x improvement over Swift, right? Swift, if anybody's sent a wire internationally, that takes days to clear typically. Whereas with Ethereum, I can be on the phone with somebody. And just like I can wait for that email to hit, I can wait to just see it in the blockchain. And I can say, oh, that transaction is done. Boom, I can now get the deal closed. And so this is the speed difference here is the difference between a physical mail, like sending a letter, which takes two to three days. Person email, which takes minutes. And think about how big a difference that made. Like when you went from physical mail to email, just the metabolism of business changed. When you go from two to three days for international commerce to minutes, the metabolism of international business changes. Third point, crowdfunding. So in 2015, if you go to Wikipedia and you look at the list of the largest crowdfunders, okay, you will see that it's like maybe $10 million, $15 million. By 2017 and 2018, a large crowdfunder was $4 billion, right? So that's like a 400x improvement in about two to three years. And that's more than 10x. That's like a 400x. Now you might argue, well, what are those things funding? They're all funding ICOs and crypto stuff. It's all this Uruburus. But it's actually something where you could fund a building, right? You could fund pretty much anything. Now that folks are customized using crypto to do this kind of thing, it's a powerful innovation and crowdfunding. And I can go on and on and I probably write an article on this, but just a few more examples. So like Delaware and Corporation, right? In many studies, like the World Bank has a study called Doing Business. And in this study, they actually say, hey, how long does it take you to incorporate in your country? Does it take you weeks or months or does it take you days? And if it takes you days, well, you're a great country for business, great country for startups. Well, Ethereum has shattered that and destroyed that because it's not days anymore. It's minutes. You can literally get a smart contract into the blockchain in minutes, right? And that's amazing. That works internationally. You're not incorporating in Delaware. You're incorporating on the blockchain. And it might seem like an opposite comparison today, but lots and lots of stuff, all these VC terms, all of these bits of Delaware law are currently, as we speak, being encoded into smart contracts. And the incorporation on the blockchain will become probably the default in like, I don't know, 10 or 15 years. And there's more, like the time to set up bank accounts, the time to audit. In 2013, people talked about Bitcoin as a scam. But today, the big four, when they audit a blockchain firm, they use the blockchain as the source of ground truth that they check all of your transactions against. So from a scam to the gold standard in like five years. And so the point here is, we're 10xing all of these financial primitives, like basic, fundamental things, and how we move money, how we think about money. And that's going to have consequences, good consequences, hopefully. Relatedly, not only have, you know, blockchain's 10x lots of things, they've already created many billion dollar entities, right? So, you know, three that have, you know, risen in particular, you know, the folks who founded Newcoins, the miners who run these gigantic server farms, and the exchanges. And each of these three groups has created and captured billions of dollars in total revenue. It's comparable sort of to the 90s internet when, you know, it's kind of the infrastructure stage and, you know, search engines and Akamai and, you know, AOL and so on. We're getting built out at that time. Sixth. Now, people talk about blockchains as being trustless and Bitcoin is about, you know, no trust. I think the much better way of thinking about it is that they give you a choice of who to trust. Okay? So before you just had to trust a bank, right? You had to store your money to bank. You can't just go and, you know, withdraw like, you know, a million dollars from the bank, or you could, but, you know, you'd be on a lot of lists. And you know, today what you can do is you can certainly still store the bank, should you so desire, you can store it with, you know, a company like Quimbase, or, and this is very new, you can store it on your computer. You can store it on a USB key. You can, you know, store it in the cloud. You can basically self-custody and arbitrary amount of money. And that's a major innovation because, you know, it's like, you can't carry a bunch of gold bricks around with you. You might be able to carry around two cases full of cash, but it's a little bit conspicuous. And now you can carry an arbitrary amount of money. So that's a very new thing. You don't have to trust a bank if you don't want to. And you know, place it like that as well. This is actually, you know, truly a killer app. Number seven, I hinted at this before, but just to drill into this point, one can argue that the single most important data structure in Silicon Valley is the cap table, right? Finally, the very simple table that shows, you know, which people or entities own what shares of the company, right? Your common stock, your series seed, A, B, et cetera, right? That data structure, that little table that Excel spreadsheet maintained thing is what has aligned people from every country around the globe, you know, to build Silicon Valley. And the scale at which it's aligned them is tens, hundreds, sometimes thousands of people pre-IPO. You build this huge company and then everybody, you know, hopefully does well together. But you know, the state of the art for managing the most important data structure in Silicon Valley is a Excel spreadsheet or a Google sheet, right? Which is kind of kind of amazing. And now what we've got with the blockchain is you can 10 or 100 or 1000X that number of people, you know, something like, you know, bat, for example, is 54,000 addresses that hold bat. And you can see exactly who owns what went, right? And this is fully programmatic. So one way I think about it is if aligning a few hundred people, you know, at a time, built Silicon Valley, what does aligning a few hundred thousand people at a time, or a few million people at a time, what can that build? Right? So you can now align human beings and incentivize them like never before. That's a really, really big deal. So, Nibri, you know, one way I think about this is, you know, like some of you here will be like, oh, you know, I got to see him for too late, I miss mobile, you know, it's over. No, it's not over just beginning. So you know, one thing we think of as like blockchain first or crypto first is like the new mobile first. It provides a weapon with which to go and attack and open many industries or areas that are either close to competition or seemingly impregnable or not even thought of as a kind of thing you could innovate on, right? So you know, I already mentioned, you know, international wires and precious metals and messaging. Now, I'll talk about the social bit and a little bit more. But there's also other areas that, you know, normally when you think of as things you could even innovate on, for example, like DNS, right? With crypto, you can innovate on DNS. You can innovate at the protocol level, you know, with things like, you know, block stack or DNS or handshake where you can register domain names. These are also scare senties. You can register them in a blockchain and you can route, you know, things through them. You can have incentivized versions of BitTorrent and incentivized versions of SMTP. All these protocols, you know, that you previously thought of as kind of, you know, non monetizable are now potentially impregnable and monetizable. And there's also, you know, commons like Wikipedia open source projects where you can now take a fresh gloss in them and think, okay, how could I maybe tokenize this? How could I make this even better? And so, you know, this type of stuff, you know, there's so many different crypto first companies that are kind of swarming and attacking these different verticals that I couldn't even enumerate all them, but this gives you some of the flavor of them. Coinbase Adventures alone is made like 40 investments over the course of last year. Ninth point. So blockchain's break network effects, okay, and they give a completely new tool a can opener for going after skilled social networks in two side of marketplaces. One way of thinking about this is if you think about Metcalf's law, you think about network utility. Typically, you know, the larger the network, you know, the higher the value to the user. So Facebook got two billion people, you know, supposedly, you know, runaway advantage, you can't dispassive, right? But there's something really interesting about crypto, which is that if you have a token whose value is associated with the startup, the tokens upside is maximal when the size of the network is smallest, right? So for example, an early investor in Snapchat had more upside than somebody who invested in the series D round where it already had, you know, 10 million plus users, right? So upside is itself valuable, and now you've got a second term in the equation which can balance out that first term. Some kind of hypothetical future value that for the first time you can programmatically issue to your users for sign up and other kinds of actions that they take within your app, right? I mean, imagine if Facebook like had something where the folks who signed up for it, the first 100,000 or 200,000 or a million users or end users received some slice of Facebook's equity for doing that, well, that would be a very big deal. You'd actually start making money by signing up for all these dumb social apps, right? So that's actually something which I think is a very powerful tool for going after scaled social networks to side of marketplaces and things like that, split some of the upside with the user. 10th and relatedly. Blockchains, I believe, are going to transform social networks. So for the last 10 years, people have been, you know, liking and poking and messaging each other, you know, wasting time. The next 10 years, you know, well, we've done making friends a time to start making money, right? So, basically, those edges we think are going to now have money on them, cryptocurrency. And you're going to have new kinds of social networks. What we're going to call them, maybe digital economies or crypto economies, the fundamental difference being that your time on them is not wasted. Your time on them is actually like a form of work where you're actually remunerated for it, right? And, you know, some of these, you know, maybe existing social networks might be able to retrofit, but I think you're going to have to construct wholly new social networks that are based on these kinds of behaviors from the beginning where earning is part of the equation. So, you know, finally, just on the topic of blockchain, blockchain is like a partial move away from the cloud and towards privacy, okay? An amazing stat from earlier this year is that ledger sold its millionth hardware wallet, right? I think of a hardware wallet. Actually, this is earlier last year, early 2018. I think of a hardware wallet as being a pretty arcane kind of thing, right? But when a million of them have been sold, you're probably eventually going to have a billion sold in some form or the other, right? And you know, one possibility is a hardware wallet is like a phone charger or bundled with a phone. So, you get like three devices, you know, the phone, the phone charger and the hardware wallet rather than two. There's lots of different, you know, distribution models you could imagine, but the fundamental concept is I think hardware wallets are going to become very popular. And that's a move away from the cloud and towards privacy because the whole concept of a hardware wallet is you're not keeping your keys in the cloud, you're keeping it locally. One possible future model is something where your data's on the cloud, but it's encrypted with the private keys that you're using in your hardware wallet. And so nobody can read it other than you and it's only decrypted and re-encrypted just in time. I think things like home worth encryption and so on will make that possible. So let me briefly just give 10 things about Coinbase and I'll take some questions. Do you know how long time I think? So you think of Coinbase itself as like the interface between Fiat and crypto. And you know, we have both a retail and like a professional interface. And on the Fiat side we're building like a Wall Street 2.0, right? Like Custody and indexes and commerce. And on the crypto side we're doing like blockchain first apps like Earn and Coinbase wallet. And we work closely with regulators. You know, our goal is to remain the safe legal and trusted part of crypto. And you've got all these licenses and so on. Money transfer, license, all that stuff. And our mission is basically to create a more open financial system for the world. And what that means is it's kind of two different groups of users that would benefit from that. The first group are developers, investors, power users of money who are trying to move money around in different kinds of ways. Do fancy things with money. And the second group are the marginalized. The folks who are unbanked, the folks who do not have bank accounts. Both of these folks in different ways are pushing on the financial system to make it more open. And those are our folks. You know, what does that mean? By the way, what does a more open financial system mean? It does mean upside. Sometimes means downside. Upside is that you can raise $35 million in 30 seconds or disrupt the finances. The downside is there's new kinds of hacks and new kinds of scams and so on. But I do believe in the medium term, you know, we'll mitigate the downsides with things like multi-sager over having. You know, Coinbase, we're kind of thinking of ourselves as bridging from the investment phase to the utility phase. Which is to say that crypto is sort of the opposite emergency model of social media. Social media piled up the users first and then had to prove out monetization. And crypto proved out monetization first in almost the most literal sense. And now needs to prove out utility. But we're seeing that happen. You know, I can go into lots of different things with earn, with decentralized finance. And we think that's a big part of the next, you know, five years or so. Coinbase is actually named after where the blockchain starts. So the so called Coinbase transaction is where the new crypto is created in Bitcoin. And that's why, you know, we think it's also where the blockchain starts for users, right? Just like, you know, windows, you started using it with the start button or Google search is where you started browsing internet. You know, log on to Facebook how you started using social media. Coinbase is where you start using crypto, right? So we think of ourselves as kind of like this sort of on-ramp, this start button for crypto. If you're making headlines, you can read more about us online. And that's about it. And I'll happy to take questions. You mentioned about blockchain, breaking, and network effect. So I'm just wondering from like the investors perspective. Do you think that would encourage more short-term behaviors? Because surely all the benefits that currently front very different types of development things. Well, sure, absolutely. So her question is, does this kind of model encourage short-term behavior among users? And I'd say maybe, but you know, they only really realize this value if the network is scaled. That is to say, you know, it has theoretical future value. You might be able to flip to somebody, but you're not going to get 10,000 X unless you know, the thing is scaled. And so it's, well, it's true that liquidity does present some short-term issues. I think on net, it does align people towards longer-term things. How is Coinbase handling the emerging proof of stake systems? So question is, how is Coinbase handling the emerging proof of stake systems? So we are closely looking at everything. I can't talk about any specific assets we're adding. We did publish a blog post in December talking about specific assets we were looking at. And that included several coins that implement proof of stake in different ways. Can you provide a more sort of full-sum picture of what a downside scenario for crypto looks like? You've been generally positive in your presentation. But obviously, this is another side to it perhaps. And you're having a bad night with what? What will be the causes of death? Excellent question. So what are the risk scenarios? What are the downside cases for crypto? I'd give a few. I think it's gotten pretty far. So as of 2019, for example, crypto is sort of what stood like the crack down of the Chinese government in 2017. It's stood enormous numbers of articles proclaiming Bitcoin dead and so on. And tons of bubbles and whatnot. Insofar as I think there's future risk to put them in a few buckets. First is partition tolerance. So at least right now, the Bitcoin blockchain is not built to handle extended partitions. So if, for example, the Great Firewall goes in blocks, port A3 to A3, and then there's like a back and forth and eventually comes difficult for the blockchain to synchronize across borders, then you could have like a peekaboo problem where the chain is extended in China by mining, but most transactions are happening in the rest of the world, and synchronization is not happening fast enough. Now, there's work-or-owns for this. Like there's a satellite which is pumping the blocks from Bitcoin into China, because China's controlled over airspace but not space-space. There's other work-or-owns where you could like stick in the graphically in code packets and bring them into China. But we'd have to actually run the experiment to see if it was possible. It's for the Great Firewall to actually introduce it. Now, the Firewall would have to be so tight that we'd have to introduce it, not just the service, but any one megabyte transfer, like in all of China across billions of people, so that'd be hard but possible. So let's call that one approach, the partition tolerance. Second is if there's some CVE, you know, like really critical vulnerability that we have not, you know, seeing that it allows people to counterfeit large numbers of Bitcoins and, you know, like break the value of the system. And by the way, the reason I keep focusing on Bitcoin here is it is sort of like the fundamental of the system. If it was hacked, if there were serious security issues, I think it would set back the industry, like at least five years or so, like if people have to rebuild around it. With all that said though, I think those kinds of issues that I just mentioned are technological issues, where it could set the thing back, but I think the fundamental concept of blockchains of decentralized currency is out there. And then folks, what they'll do is they'll fix that and then have a more robust version in the future. That's kind of where I'm at and open to other thoughts. You talked a little about banks serving as a trusted source for record keeping, but the other main role banks have is a monetary policy. That's why we have Federal Reserve banks. And so I can see how Bitcoin does the record keeping function of banks, but I am not seeing anything replacing the monetary policy function. And economists have learned one thing in the last 200 years. That's really critical to an economy as well being. So how are you envisioning Bitcoin functioning as a currency without a monetary policy? Great question. So the question is, if I can paraphrase, how does Bitcoin interact with monetary policy? How could it function as a currency without monetary policy? And so what I think is we are engaged in a grand experiment, which is what I think of as empirical macroeconomics. So basically, and I'm sure I'm going to offend some macroeconomics in the audience, I think that microeconomics is pretty empirical in the sense of you've got the theory of the firm and venture capitalists are running lots of experiments all the time. And you have a thesis on how a company should be organized or not. And if you're wrong, you lose money. With macroeconomics, because it involves assemblages of very large numbers of people, it's hard to do like reproducible experiments until relatively recently. So I actually have these supplemental slides. I've got every question. So, blockchain is big macroeconomics and experimental science. Virtual economies have been a topic of discussion for about 15 years, where this guy, Edward Castrenova, a smart guy at a professor, has been looking at this in the context of world of warcraft and things like that. And in those kind of economies, you print money, you see what the effect is on prices and so on. And it's pretty cool where you can run experiments with the system of people who are actually trying and responding to incentives. And what I think is going to happen is that type of work is going to link up with crypto economies. And we're going to start to get a lot of real life empirical economic data on what life is like without a central monetary policy in this opt-in kind of system. And one of the really good things about this is it's like a bananza for econometrics people, because there was this vague concept of six degrees of separation in the late 90s. And then we got this digital data structure of the social network. So there's a vague concept of six degrees of separation. And then you've got something that was digital and computable. You could think of it as a graph and so on. And the same way we have this vague concept of the economy. And now we've got a blockchain, which is the record of every single transaction that's ever happened down to the penny back to T equals zero. And so every economic theory that one has about transactions or price support or whatever can be tested. And importantly, one can also develop blockchains that have inflationary policies that are connected to central banks and so on. So I think what we're going to see is just a ton of different kinds of economic experiments. Some inflationary, some deflationary, some demorage, some weird kinds of combinations that resist political classification. I think we're going to run the experiments and see what happens. Let's see. The same recent trend of Coinbase, Acton and Venezuela. And there was somewhat of a controversial thing. Could you explain a little bit more about how the Conbase did and how it can apply to other emerging economies or distressed economies? Yeah, sure. So I think you asked what would Coinbase do in Venezuela and so on. I think we've announced this, but we basically gave away money to folks on the ground in Venezuela. There's a lot of theories on like internationally. But one theory is just give the money to people directly. Now they've got phones. You don't necessarily need intermediaries. People are often good judges of what to do with money. And now you can actually via the fact that all these people have smartphones just give them money directly. So we have this site, givecrypto.org, which is funded by Brian, or a CEO and co-founder, and a bunch of other folks. We're trying this experiment to see, okay, can we get the money to Venezuelans? Is Bitcoin like something they can use or borrow against? Is it considered currency like in that environment? And if so, then what are the consequences? And if that works well, then maybe we can scale it up. So that's what we're doing there. Thank you for that. I think we're meant on the environmental attack on currencies. So I've read that you've added $1,000, was a good coin. What that means to the case is that somewhere in China, $500,000 worth of coal are being earned to hire up the mining farm. That doesn't seem sustainable if you want to expand. So what's the solution to that? Yeah, so a couple of thoughts. You received the question? Of course, of course. What is the environmental impact of Bitcoin? Is it something where we're consuming tons of energy for it and so on? So that's a complex issue, but let me offer a few thoughts on that. First is that a lot of Chinese mining is actually happening at night. And the reasons happening at night is you have hydroelectric plants, geothermal plants that are basically spinning a water wheel at night, because power can't easily be stored in the grid. But having this power consumption is usually maximal at 12 noon, and then it drops off at 4 a.m. and then comes back up. It's got this sinusoidal cycle. And at night, that power is often just wasted. But now what's interesting is folks are using Bitcoin mining as almost a kind of battery, where what you do rather than just throwing away that excess power is you mine Bitcoin. And in theory, what could happen, and we're starting to see some of those, is you can have markets where while you might be able to store power in a normal battery, you store it in the form of mine Bitcoin, and then you can have after markets where it kind of trades, and you might be able to balance the power grid better. So it may actually be something that leads to interesting innovations in like a form of energy storage. But so that's kind of one answer. The second answer is, if you think about what Bitcoin represents, I don't think it's correct to compare it to let's say like PayPal, which is something that's a, well, it's so cheap, PayPal, you just, you know, minusing and plusing things on a central server. I compare Bitcoin more to like a system of property rights, right, like more analogous to let's say, you know, the miners are more analogous to the police and the military, all these extremely expensive things that maintain American property rights. And so if you think about the energetic cost of that, it's actually very substantial. And so this is a system of property rights, which is developed in a different way, you can measure the amount of energy that goes into it. I think it's probably less than the police, the military, and the banking system and all those things that enforce offline property rights. But I think that's the second, you know, comparable that that's interesting. Sarah in the back. There's so many ways in use case for blockchain, some of you look, some of them you look to, some of them out there for banks and whatever. What is stopping companies to do the more widespread scale today? Blockchain and also like banks that are as the true, they were the types of trends in Bitcoin so on. Yeah, so what's stopping companies from adopting on a widespread scale? What's holding blockchain back? So in some sense, you know, the industry is actually already fairly large in the sense of, we saw many people here held cryptocurrency. So the first killer after cryptocurrency is gochis that sounds as hold cryptocurrency as an investment and hope it goes up, right? Okay. But that speculation phase was necessary and the reason we think of it as necessary is speculation was installation that has to say before you have this decentralized finance environment with decentralized loans and derivatives and so on, you have to treat those packets moving back and forth as money. So the last 10 years what that did is you have an environment where 80% of Americans have heard of Bitcoin. Everybody kind of knows it's valuable. They know, you know, good chunk of Americans also know Ethereum is valuable and so on. And once they treat it as money, then you can actually develop apps on top of that. But you needed to have that speculative phase to install in people's heads. Now why aren't businesses using it yet? I think what you're going to see is it's going to radiate out from the crypto sector. That is to say, businesses within the crypto economy, you know, miners, exchanges, you know, blockchain companies, new asset issuers, et cetera. This is actually a large enough set right now where folks pay each other back and forth in Bitcoin and Ethereum. And the folks around the border of the crypto economy are folks like prop traders, right, like who are, you know, just, you know, they're like guys in Chicago who invest their own money or fintech developers, right. You know, like Square has gone into the game a bit. Robinhood has gone into the game. Those are the folks on the border who are like kind of crossing the chasm. They weren't founded on crypto but are starting to get into it. And that environment, those folks, you know, will they'll grow for the next like three to five years. And then it'll kind of go out one more set and so on. So I think it's going to be a gradual process. But I think over time, you start to get more businesses involved as we build that. Yes. Can you hear me, Aaron? Yes. Okay. So we have a staffer journal watching on policy at the law school, which I'm returning. I think that what do you think would be some good articles? Well, you might see the governance or legal or policy space that would kind of push for those in my back. Great. So a question was articles on governance policy philosophy. Well, so happens I have some supplementary slides on that. All right. So, so basically here's let me give you kind of one concept that I think is a very powerful one, right. So one concept I think a lot about is that a blockchain, it's not just like a database. It's a database with a community, which is very different. It's like a database plus a social network. In some cases, plus a protocol and a compiler, right. It was actually pretty complicated, you know, interplay. So a blockchain's value address was from its community, meaning, you know, you've got Bitcoin maximalist, you've got your Ethereum developers, like a million people are at these meetups now. You've got your XRP army and so on and so forth, right. And the thing about this is just like, you know, within a country, you know, like the the Estonians, there's a butcher, the baker, the council maker, they all interact. They have the Estonian crew or they used to before they had the euro. And then they can just, you know, use that within themselves and then has an exchange rate with the outside world, right. That that exchange rate is their API with the outside world. They use their own currency within their own, you know, kind of country and then the exchange rate outside. And the same way, once you've got a critical mass of enough people online who just believe in something, they can just transact amongst themselves in this crypto and and value it. And then offline, you know, you may think they're crazy for valuing XYZ coin, but you're happy to buy and sell XYZ for USD with them, maybe sell. And so a blockchain's value address from its community. One of the consequences of this is, if you just take three random people, they're not economically aligned. Any one of them can lose or win together, right. Or rather lose or win on their own. But if they all hold the same cryptocurrency, then they either all lose together or they all win together. Okay, this is a way of like economically aligning human beings. This is, you know, when VCs talk about alignment, this is an underlying data structure that that that underpins that. And so the thing about this is you have this community forming behavior online and that community forming behavior leads to these tribes. And I think over time, what it does, you know, I can talk about this bit also over time, what it leads to is experiments and self governance, right, where, you know, once you've got a system of property rights in the blockchain, you can start doing experiments with other kinds of things. So that's the type of stuff that you could cover. Sorry. We've got a lot of cases where like people just lose their private fees. And then there's pros and b going that cannot be access anymore. And with a big number of being kept. Is there is industry thinking about the solution to actually generate more liquidity? So is just so the question is basically, you know, folks lose their Bitcoin's Bitcoin numbers cap to how does industry think about that. I think, you know, like Bitcoin is meant to be like cash, right, if you lose $100, you can't message the US government to give you another $100. This dollar bill down the drain, right. So that's what Bitcoin is kind of intended to be like. In a sense, it actually benefits slightly over other Bitcoin holder because it's like, you know, renormalizing the capital. You lose 1% of Bitcoin or everybody else is more valuable. The solution for this, there's a few. One of them is, you know, store your crypto with somebody else if you don't want to handle it yourself. And a lot of people do that, right. So that's certainly an option. The second option is something that multi-sig where you have a few different folks who have keys to it. And there's yet other kinds of, you know, sophisticated password reset, social reset schemes that make it harder to just lose your crypto by accident. But it's something's being worked on. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So you mentioned earlier that blockchain is a harder move away from 1000, you know, privacy. Yeah. When would you use the point where it's a tipping point where it's a full move with privacy where it's got the really good risk case work? I think you need like hundreds of millions or billions of people to have crypto and need homeomorphic encryption. I think that's what starts to tip it, but that's like at least, you know, 10 years out, maybe 20. Okay. Okay. Okay.
