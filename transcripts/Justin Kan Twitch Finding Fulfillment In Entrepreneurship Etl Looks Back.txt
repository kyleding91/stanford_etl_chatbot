 Who you are defines how you built. This is the Auditorial Thought Leaders Series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. Welcome YouTube communities and Stanford communities to the entrepreneurial Thought Leaders seminar. I am Ravi Balani, a lecturer in the Management Science and Engineering Department at Stanford University and the Director of Alchemist and Accelerator for Enterprise Startups. This is the kickoff for the new year for ETL and ETL is brought to you by STVP, the Entrepreneurship Center in Stanford School of Engineering and Basis, the Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students. I can think of no better guest to kick off a new start to a new year than Justin Khan. Justin has jumped head first into entrepreneurship without having a filter like few people I know. So when it comes to starting something new, we are blessed to have the master of starting bold endeavors, Justin Khan. Justin is a serial entrepreneur. A few people, frankly, have experienced peaks as high as Justin has on the entrepreneurial journey and depths as low as Justin has. And few if anybody is as honest and unfiltered about the experience. If you don't follow Justin, I highly encourage you to follow him on a variety of different social media outlets. You will have a better and more interesting and informed life if you do. But let me give you the formal introduction for Justin. So Justin is a graduate from Yale where he studied physics and philosophy as an underget at Yale. Then at age 23, he started with fellow Yali's Emmett Sheer, Michael Sybel and Kyle Voitt, Justin TV, which was famous for being one of the first and anchor lifecaster platforms where a lot was centered around Justin. A lot of it was centered around Justin's 24 seven streaming of his life. Justin TV gave birth to two other successful startups, social cam and most famously Twitch. Twitch ended up getting acquired by Amazon for just shy of a billion dollars and is arguably today worth 15 billion dollars. Justin has gone on to be a serial entrepreneur and investor. He also famously started atrium, which was a legal tech firm that raised 75 million dollars, but ultimately shut down. He's also been a press and investor. He has funded companies like alto, cruise, bird, Reddit and many, many others. And today he's the general partner of VC fund goat greatest of all time and the host of the quest podcast. So without further ado, please welcome Justin Khan to Stanford. Justin welcome. Thanks. This is amazing intro. I'm glad we recorded that. I'm going to play it for myself every morning. It is really on it is really awesome to have you Justin and I know we're going to have a lot more stuff to cover than we're going to have time. So just thank you in advance. Just to start off, I want people to, you know, people know you as the co founder of Twitch and maybe infamously with atrium and also being a former partner at YC and other other things. But just for the record, can you tell people how many startups have you founded? Would you consider yourself a co founder of in your life? And could you give the scorecard of if you had to break them down in terms of wins, draws and losses, what would that look like? That's a good question. I don't know. It's probably like, if you include the ones I'm working on now, maybe like eight or nine, which isn't good. You know, I think if you're a good entrepreneur, you probably stick to one thing that really works. There's a little bit of luck in that. So maybe like you start two companies. What really worked. I think I've had a couple wins. You know, we had Justin TV, which are Twitch. We spun out that out of Justin TV. We just spun out this comic called Social Cam Autodesk for $60 million. And then more recently, I incubate this company, Alta, that's doing really well. I got sort of my house. And so those were maybe like a couple wins. And then there's a lot of like, there were some like draws. I started to come to call it exact. That was like a basically we end up selling it. You know, it was in acquisition. People made a little bit of money. It was very successful. And then sort of another company, whether my very first company, Kiko was like kind of a draw. We like end up selling it on eBay or some amount of money, which was okay. And then like numerous numbers losses of companies that just didn't work out. But do you really believe that you should have that it's not it's a it's a vice not a virtue. Having started all these companies because I think there's. And I want to ask you this sort of honestly because there's sort of two schools of thought. One is, you know, you find something you love and you stick with that as your mission. And I think the other school of thought is more than entrepreneurship is about resilience and testing and trying and experimenting. And I think many would argue that you wouldn't have, you know, stumbled upon the altos and the twitches without having that appetite to be okay with failure and starting many companies. I'm curious what guidance you're going to give the next generation the emerging young 20 year 20 plus year olds about entrepreneurship. Do you think they should just find one thing and stick with it or do you would you espouse the path that you took. Yeah, I mean, I think it depends on the personality, right? Like it depends on the person for you know, I friends are much, much more successful than I am started one company. Yeah, they like started to be a coin base. It just was something that they really cared about. They picked the right idea and like they scaled, you know, as the company scaled, they also like kept learning and growing and scaling with the company. And my personality is more like, you know, I love the start and new ideas out of learning. And so entrepreneurship is kind of a vehicle for me to learn and grow. And so I think, you know, my personality is suited to maybe exploring many different things over time. And so, you know, it's, it's, I think economically it's probably like lower expected value, but it's just what I love to do. So here we are. And so, it isn't that the ultimate thing that it should be driven by who you are. Yeah, it should be driven by who you are not, not the answer. Right. Right. Right answer. No, I had my share of success. So, you know, it's great. Like I think I've, I've just discovered the like version of entrepreneurship that works for me. Yes, but I don't think you should be self deprecating about it. I guess that's where the division is. I think you should embrace that. That's your virtue. And so, I think, even to that. So I think a few people, I think one of the upsides of having done all these experiences is a lot of people will comment about what you need to succeed or what you need to avoid to fail. But I know very few people who've actually experienced it, who've experienced successes. You know, at the order of magnitude that you have and failures at the order of magnitude that you have as well. I'm curious if there's any durable lessons that you know for sure that are required now that you know of now having gone through the failures and the successes that are required for success. I'm sure there's a lot, but I'm curious if you could share at least the top most key durable takeaways that you've had from those experiences. Sure. Yeah. So, you know, I had this billion dollar outcome, like you mentioned in the intro. I also had the, you know, raised 75 million dollars for another company and completely failed. And we ended up returning mostly, you know, some of the capital investors were mostly like we lost money. And so, you know, we're the lessons like I think they're all the obvious ones that people probably heard a thousand times like you really have to focus on a differentiated product. I think if you don't have product differentiation that you know that's a new and novel and useful product that's 10 times better than whatever else is out there. I think it's really hard to grow something in like hypergrowth, you know, an all stems from product. And I think I tried to ignore that at various times and focus on it enough and those were like really the root causes of the failures. And just to, I don't want to take away from the others, but just to make that clear, you know you have a differentiated product when it's a 10X. Yeah. Like you have product market fit. You feel like you're rolling the bulldozer downhill, right? Most of the startup is like before you have product market fit, you feel like you're rolling the bulldozer. You're like you know, begging people to try it and give it a chance and eventually if you discover something that's really useful and differentiated, then people start to come to you and you feel like you can't make it fast enough. You can't keep the servers up. Whatever, you know, that is for you. You know, that you feel like you're rolling the bulldozer downhill, you're just running after it. And I think that's the difference. And you know, you can, I think it's really easy and Silicon Valley to cargo coal. All the things that successful founders do that aren't working on your product. You know, like, oh, I need to hire like executives or raise a lot of money. But those things are relevant, you know, they're downstream from having a product that everybody wants, right? And they're pretty much irrelevant and actually detrimental to you discovering product, you know, something that works that has product market fit oftentimes. But it's easy to get distracted by them. And I have in my career, you know, so that was one probably the most important lesson, you know. And are there any pitfalls? I mean, this is sort of the converse of the same question. But are there any pitfalls that you can advise founders to avoid now that you didn't appreciate before? Obviously, the one on product market fit differentiation as or is key. But are there any other pitfalls? Yeah. So for myself, you know, like another lesson learned or like necessary ingredient is like to work on things that you actually care about doing, right? Like not, I think in the past, I've been at times like really mercenary like, oh, is a good business idea? So I want to build it because I think it will be successful and make money whatever it is. And I think having really spending time to work on, you know, spending time to think about what do you like actually love to do and what do you care about? And finding things that, you know, I'll space that you could work on something that you love to work on in some way, you know, it doesn't have to be in every way, right? But in some way, something that energizes you. That's what's going to keep you going when it doesn't, when it's, when it's hard. And I think oftentimes, you know, no matter who you are and what kind of entrepreneur you are, what kind of background you, it's always going to be hard at times. And so, and just a, yeah, product, you know, that company or market fit or founder market fit, you know? Yeah. And I love, and just to dig in on that then. So let's go through. I would love to talk about founder company fit for Twitch and atrium and maybe alto. But when you were going into Justin TV, I guess, even the precursor to Twitch, what was, did you have an, well, first of all, did you have a vision when you started Justin TV? Or was it there, I think there's also these two schools of thought. One is, is that you have the entrepreneur that has the bold vision and then they manifest that through the art of entrepreneurship. And then there's another, which is that no entrepreneurship is really about the process. And the vision will just unfold and you just need to focus on design thinking, iteration, and work with people that you love and let the future tell you what the future is. I would say there's like two kinds of entrepreneurship, like the, where the first kind, you know, vision-based, the second, which is like, you are, you are the, you're on customer, right? Or you really deeply understand the customer. Maybe you're not your own customer, but you probably work with your customer or like, are very close to somebody in your customer. That's how you know about the idea. And with Justin TV, that's a perfect example where, you know, it sounds surprising, but it actually was, it was both of those things, right? Like when we pitched that idea for Justin TV to PG, you know, Paul Graham in the very beginning was a founder of like, commentator, we were saying, hey, this is, you know, this could be a new form of entertainment on the internet. And I think in a way, we were right, like people, you know, my core, the core idea was like people want to follow people. This is been 2006 before social media, right? Really happened. So, so we were like, people want to follow other people, their interest in other people's lives. And I think that has been, that's like core insight that's been borne out actually. And we thought, we said, this is the vision of this is like, it could be all these different types of people. We didn't see this like social media at the time, but like, where anyone could just sign up, but like, we thought there would be hundreds of streams of different people where you could see live video, their life, right? And people would want to watch that. So there was like a big vision around it and there's like a new form of reality TV. Obviously like, it didn't play out exactly the way we thought. Well, actually, I would say it actually did play out exactly what we thought like 15 years later, where now like, IRL streaming is huge on Twitch. And that is actually happening where you have hundreds of not thousands of people are streaming their lives in various ways on Twitch. So there was that big vision, but then the second thing part of it was like, it was also what I wanted to do, right? And what I mean is like, I was actually the customer. I wanted to stream my own life because I wasn't very popular when I was a kid and I was always looking for the attention of other people as a way to like get their approval. And so that was manifested as my, I was a young adult and I was like, okay, this is, you know, I want to create. I'm not like, if I can just stream my life to internet, then I'll be popular or something as like a subconscious process, right? So I actually was my own customer, right? And we built that very first version of Justin TV, which was like a live video and chat with my own use in mind, right? Like we were creating our own show. And so actually it did, it was, you know, both. And I think that's why it was so successful in the beginning, you know? And so you had the vision and you had this intention to, and was that your, was that, was the intention driven by economics? Yeah, I mean, a part of it was like, yeah, we want to sort of start up and we thought it could like was a good way to make money. But it was also like exploring our own curiosity, right? But would you step? Okay. Oh, sorry. There's many motivations, right? Like part of it was like, yeah, I mean, I had my friends at Reddit, like, sort of company, they got paid very quickly. I was like, go, I want that. I want that, right? So there was an economic motivator, but there's also a, there was like a curiosity, right? Like I really love new ideas and like new technology ideas and applications of technology on culture. And so for me, that was like a, it was kind of a novel idea and it was exciting to perceive that. You know, so you, I'm going to come back to, to, um, Twitch and Justin TV, but I want to stay on this thread of vision and intent. Um, for those who don't know, Twitch got acquired for $970 million. Um, you were, you know, your bank account was not empty after that. You were, you know, it was, it probably had a couple more zeros than you were used to sing. And then you go and you decide to start atrium. Um, can we talk about vision and intent with atrium? And, and how that might have been different than Justin TV and Twitch. And if there were any takeaways from that, did you have a vision going into atrium or was it more driven by an intention than the vision and was that intention and, and can you add color on, on, on what was going into the process? Yeah, there, I mean, there was a vision. Well, I, I would say it was, it started off as like a, you know, kind of like a business model innovation, right? And a business model innovation was like, you can create this new type of corporate ties law firm where, you know, it's run more like a business, right? And it could be more efficient for the customers and the clients. And, you know, the, the problem, I would say, where, where, which I think is true, actually, like that's like a, that is a, I think that's like a reasonable angle of attack. Or just like the problem was, I think in the execution and probably in the founder market fit where, you know, I thought it was a really good business idea, but I wasn't really our own customer. And I mean, I was kind of like in that, I was a founder who wanted to like, we started companies that had legal spend, but I didn't really care that much about solving that problem from a product perspective. And I think the problem with that is, you know, it wasn't, was consequently, we didn't create it sufficiently differentially in a product that like representative product market fit. You know, like I was able to scale a lot of organization in infrastructure and fundraising and stuff like that, but it really doesn't matter at the end of the day unless you have like a really substantially differentiated product. Hmm. And, and what was the intention then? So why I understand there is this vision of a new business model. But why spend your precious few days on this earth after having made, you know, more money than the top half of the top half of the top half of the top half of the top one percent of people in the world. What was the intention behind spending your time on something that you didn't necessarily care that much about? Yeah, I think that for me, you know, I want to make a lot of money more and I want it to be more successful because I like I, I, there was a, you know, after a year, so Twitch, I was like, oh, okay, now what? Like, what's the point? Like it kind of got the, you know, copycat dog chasing the car and I copycat was like, now what? You know, I didn't really have a perfect feel like a sense of purpose. And so for me, it's like falling back on what I know, like I know about entrepreneurship, like what's our beer company? Maybe the goal is like not to start a $1 billion company. It's the sort of $10 billion company. Here's a vehicle by which I can start a $10 billion company. And so, you know, I seemed like a reasonable path to pursue at the time. I just don't think it was like particularly a self-aware of like, or lower like insight, you know, there was a lot of wisdom in there. And was the goal to chase the former high from Twitch to try to, to like, where the goalpost just shifted and you just wanted to re-chase that experience again? Yeah, I think I, in the past, I had like experienced goalpost shifting a lot, right? Like, I remember when we first started Justin TV, you know, which turned into Twitch. I was sitting with my co-founder and I was like, hey, you know, we could make each make a million dollars in entrepreneurship. Like, because our friends at Reddit had sold Reddit for like 13 million bucks or something like that. They made like single-digit millions. I was like, we could make a million dollars each and that idea of blue or minds, right? Like, we were like, if we did that, we'd be set. And then obviously when we sold Twitch, it was like a lot more than that. And so, but then like, by that time, it was like, oh, now I have friends who are like starting, they have Dropbox or Airbnb or, you know, whatever. So like, there's a long way to go to the top. You know, it's easy to like, no matter who you are, there's always someone who's, who's doing better than you or got more than you. That's easy to look at them and be like, oh, I got, you know, I should be doing better. Human beings are very comparative creatures by nature. Yes. But then have you, do you have any takeaways now about where happiness resides in the entrepreneurship process? Because it seems like after Twitch, you would have been the poster child of any aspiring entrepreneur who is trying to make money. You made, you know, you didn't make a million dollars. You made probably two orders of magnitude more than that. And yet you still thought I need to go even, you know, I need to have 10 billion. And so in these processes, when is it the most, do you ever feel happy or fully content and say, and say it, where there's not this desire to even do more? Maybe that is tied with happiness in that entrepreneurial journey. And if so, where is that and when is that? Well, I think there's two answers. One is, is that, you know, there are like, whatever you do, whether it's entrepreneurship or anything else, you know, there are hopefully ways like experiences that you have of like being in a flow state, right? Something where you're like, very present and you just are love what you're doing. You know, you have joy, you find joy in what you're doing and you can just be fully present with it. So for me, like there were moments of that in, you know, building a product or programming, right? Like things that I just like really love to do. There were a lot of things that like I didn't have a flow state in like managing people are like worrying about the sales or, you know, whatever. There's like tons of things, but worrying about fundraising stuff like that. So that was like, well, there were punctuated moments of happiness, probably like, you know, varying degrees over time, like depending on what I was doing and what my responsibilities were on the entrepreneurial journey. So, you know, like I would encourage people, I guess if they're like looking for what to do, like you should think about like, what is the thing that gives you joy to do every day? That's what I think about every now. It's like, what do I love to do every day? And what would I do if nobody paid me for it? If nobody was watching it, if it was just for my own edification, right? And so, you know, that's why I like making content on YouTube. It's like, I love storytelling. So I'm like making content for this YouTube channel. Like it's never going to be as big as like people are making like really compelling content. It's just like a little niche around entrepreneurship, but it's, it gives me joy to do it. So, so I, you know, I do it. And so, are you past that feeling before? So right now when you see the Coinbase founders and because everybody is like Justin Khan, he's the man. And then when you see whoever is, you know, that next goalpost for you, do you still have that feeling? And if not, can you explain where you're at right now in life? And yeah, so, so, right. So like, yeah, I don't, I let it go, right? Like I let go of my like comparison to like other entrepreneurs, but it didn't happen because I made any more money over that anymore successful. Like I had like tons of comparison and like beating myself up over, oh, we should have kept going with Twitch or whatever, whatever. Like it's worth more like I should start a new company. Like that was all happening even after we saw Twitch, right? And then, you know, what changed was for me. I like kind of woke up one day. I like went through a series of life events where I realized like, oh, I am just, I like this is like, this is a treadmill that I had done a treadmill that can last forever and I'll always be dissatisfied. And maybe happiness doesn't come from external things. It comes from the internal, right? Like even like in the past, like I've achieved everything I've thought and then there's just been new goalposts. And then like another treadmill of like another hamster wheel of like unhappiness or dissatisfaction, I should say. And maybe instead, like I should focus on like how I can be satisfied every day. And like what are the things that give me peace every day? So there's a lot of things like, you know, sort of taking a gratitude journal every day, start exercising every day, start meditating every day. And basically reprogram my mind to be like, like, let go of a lot of these attachments to like other, you know, outside sources of reward or achievement. And, and are there, and so you do you find yourself then more in that flow state that you were talking about before, where you are getting more joy now than you did in the past or was there another moment in the past, where you felt it was the pinnacle of life pleasure. No, no, no, no, now is the pinnacle of life for sure. Now is the pinnacle. Yeah, like for me, it's like, yeah, I'm more in the flow state and more doing the things that give me joy every day because I'm just choosing the activities that do that. And the funny thing is like from the outside, it looks like I'm pretty much doing the exact same thing. There's this concept my meditation teacher speaks about in Buddhism, where like the final stage is like a wheel of like progression. And then the final stage, the image that represented is represented is just like the shopkeeper in the town square, whatever. And he's just living like a normal life. He's just super at peace and like free of attachment, right? But he's like gone all the way around in like from the outside you never know. Yeah. And I feel like the thing is like people are like, oh, you're just on YouTube on social media, making content and like investing and start of something, keeping starts. So like it's exactly the same thing you were doing three years ago, five years ago, 10 years ago, whatever. But the difference is like today, I just do them from a place of joy where I'm like less concerned with like, where I'm not concerned with like the outcome. And it's more about like, am I enjoying the process of this? And I'm working with people I like. Am I working? Am I doing the things that I think are my talent instead of the things that I don't think are my talent? You know, I think I'm good at fundraising. I think I'm good at like ideas. I think I'm good at mentoring and coaching. And like maybe I'm not as good at being the CEO of these companies or whatever. And so, you know, I just like focus on the things that I love every to do every day. And it happens to look like a lot of the things that I was doing before. But just part of them, the parts that I love and not the parts that I don't love. It's such a good lesson, Justin. And I so people are going to say, of course you can say that Justin, you made a hundred million dollars or whatever. And now you have the luxury of, you know, doing what you love. But I can't do that until I've had my first Twitch exit, my first Justin TV or social cam exit. What do you say to founders that say that? I mean, if you like, you can't go to Silicon Valley. I might get a job at Facebook or Google or whatever. You have like more money than you actually need, right? Because you, you know, you can eat out. You can go on vacation. Like those are the things that are like really, you know, kind of like the basic building blocks of like contentiveness, right? The thing you don't have to worry. Basically, you have like financial security. Everything after that is just like you ramping up your costs to whatever, you know, your lifestyle costs to like whatever your, your means is at the moment. And you know, so like no matter where you're at, you can make a hundred million dollars and be like, oh, I can't buy the private jet that my friend bought, you know, like, because that's 30 million bucks or whatever. Right? Like so it just scales infinitely like your needs, your potential like things that you think you need can just scale up infinitely. And so I guess the only way to be free of that is to this like for your mind of attachment. And while we're on this theme of understanding what gives you joy and energy, and can we talk a bit about resilience? So, you know, across these nine startups, you've had one huge, well, two huge breakout successes, but the majority were draws or fails. And you've also had your own strife during all these moments as you're going through and going through these journeys. Any lessons on staying resilient that you've learned that you want to pass on as durable lessons that you advise other founders to adopt? Yeah, I mean, there's okay. So I've probably talked about some of them right like I think a meditation is really important. Like being able to find ways to be present with your experience. Do you meditate every, sorry, I don't mean I meditate every day, but like, and how long would I do is a rel, that's kind of like a relevant right to you, the the listener. Like you should just find what works for you. But how many minutes do you meditate a day just because I feel like that's like kind of a red herring, right? Like, like people are going to be like, oh, I need to do a gesture. I need to do more. Like I need to do more. If you say enough minutes, I need to do 15 to 25 minutes, I need to do 30 minutes. Fair enough. Fair enough. Okay. The point is that like before I was very not able to sit with things that weren't going well, like experiences that were uncomfortable, right? So like could be physical discomfort, but also like, you know, emotional discomfort, including anxiety over what was going to happen with my startup. So if I was feeling that way, I would go and like, I would have to escape from that experience. And I had many different mechanisms that I'd escape, right? Like one was like, I would get super fucked up and just drink a lot. Or another would be like, I'd watch like a whole season of Netflix and one night or something, just to keep my mind off of like, ruminating. And the power of meditation, or there's many other like modalities that you can use to become comfortable with these uncomfortable experiences, is that it like helps you sit with it. And you can be present with the experience of, oh, something's going badly, but not have to escape from it. At least that's what really helped me. And when you feel that way, then it's like much, you're not ignoring your problems anymore. And it's much easier to like actually take the challenges of life head on. So I mean, that was like, you actually become more resilient, right? So that's one thing that really worked well for me. You know, another kind of resilience, you know, like a one of the things I've done for resilience, I think, you know, like partnering with the right people, I think is really important. So like finding the right co-founders, maybe mentors, some extent, like the people who are going to be around you to give encouragement the right time, I think is like, you know, as invaluable. I would never have like gotten nearly as far with any of my projects without like having the right people around me. And so like finding those people where you share values, you have aligned values and people you can really rely on. That's like, I think that's really critically important. Are there any unintuitive insights there? Because I think you also have tons of experience with having gone through so many different types of founding teams. Are there any unintuitive insights about when you know you have a co-founder that is a high affinity fit that you should say yes to? Yeah, I think it's, I think. And first of all, how sacred is it to have a co-founder in your opinion versus going in it, going in it solo? Well, I mean, lots of people go in it solo and arguably like some of those are the better companies, but like I think in my opinion, just knowing my personality, having a co-founder is really important. I like to be around people and work with other people. And so I think for, you know, the insight there is like, it's all about values more than anything else. I think value is alignment. That's where you get into conflict is when you have values misalignment. And values aren't necessarily like there's one set of right ones, right? You know, like I remember one of my co-founders and I like argued because he didn't believe in FaceTime at all and I believe a lot of FaceTime, right? And he was like more like, I want to be efficient and I wanted to work when no one else was in the office. And I was like, no, we gotta leave have an example for employees or whatever. No one's right. It's just a cause of conflict because like we just have different values, right? And so I think values misalignment is like super important. If there was anything else that you were going to share, you're welcome to on resilience hacks, but it sounds like it was meditation teams. Taking care of yourself is really important, like so. You know, it's the Sarbsharm marathon sprint, you know, having spending the time to make sure to take care of yourself for the long term. Oftentimes it's easy as a founder say, oh, I'm going to do that. I'm going to like, sorry, working out after we get to this milestone, right? Like right now I don't have time after I go fundraise and like it's like I'd got to do 80 hours a week or whatever, so I don't have time to take care of myself or, you know, like I'll, like you can need easy to put off everything that you've needed to want to do for yourself, but like in order for it to be maximum sustainable, right? Like you have to make sure that it's sustainable for you, right? Like it has to be like a sustainable lifestyle. And I think that's really important in something that gets overlooked. Now I'm not saying like don't work hard because like I think a lot of people swing too far the other way, like like if you guys are, you know, this is a class of Stanford students, right? So like you don't have any skills yet, right? You probably don't have that much money. So like the only thing you have right now is like your ability to work a shit on, but it has to be like sustainable, right? So you're going to be better off and sustaining that ability to work a lot if you, you know, take care of your mind, take everybody, but you know, I think many Stanford students and Yale students as well have gotten to this point because they're pretty good at numbing themselves to pain to endure, you know, to endure through long things. Is there, is there a tactical way where you know for yourself or for others when you're not taking care of yourself? And it's time to really step back. Is there a whisper before before it becomes, before it becomes like it's just like how you feel every day, right? Like I, you know, some days I don't feel that, you know, I'm like, oh, I feel like shit because I ate unhealthily or I didn't work out or whatever and just like getting yourself back on the literal treadmill sometimes, right? Or like Peloton or whatever, and go workout, like go to something like I know that signs of like, I like, I know what sets myself up to be productive, right? Like it's like if I meditate, if I exercise, if I go for a walk, whatever, then I'm like primed to like have productive time. If I like don't take care of myself, then I'm like not primed to have productive time. But just even feeling a little bit off is a strong signal. That's something where you should say. Yeah, I think people should spend more time. You know, one thing I love about meditation, I mean, like, you know, people probably take this with a grain of salt or whatever because like it's kind of like sounds woo-woo, but like the thing I like about meditation is that it helps you understand your own experience better, right? To get in touch with your own experience, whatever it is, your experience is like, you know, I feel with object today or I'm like excited or whatever you're on emotional experience, your thoughts, it's like just gives you more sensory clarity. I'm like, what is going on inside of consciousness? And I think that is helpful to like make changes, right? Like you might, before, like I went through life like very subconscious. Like for example, when we work on Justin TV, we'd have pizza for lunch every day. It's like very unhealthy. And I would eat pizza for lunch like most of the days and I'd just take a nap in the afternoon on like fall asleep and I thought, I'm just a sleepy fucking guy. You know, like I'm just like a sleepy guy and I never really correlated like, oh, like when I eat pizza like all this like a high fast carb meal or whatever, I feel terrible afterwards and like I just am tired. And like I'm you know, I'm fastened topless and I'm like, you know, I highly seem to get next foods don't do well for me. And so like I just like didn't realize that for a long, long time. And then when I became more conscious of my experience, I was like, oh, like like if I you know, there are things that I can do to like make myself feel better and prime myself for like more productive hours. And you know, I mean, that's not really the point. Like it to be the most maximally productive, but like the downstream effect is yeah, it's more productive. And so I don't know, I just feel like the more conscious about your experience is never bad. And can I and because you've been so open about talking about your relationship with alcohol and other substances, can I just create space for that? I know you've already mentioned it a little bit, but you know, there are some people that would say that having, there's a more movement right now with biohacking where people are micro dosing with hallucinogens and doing things that allows for mental plasticity. I'm curious about and I know you're a curious soul, which is why I'm at an inaudible soul. And so I'm curious about what is your relationship to external substances? And what's your viewpoint now and how has that evolved or changed or anything that you want to share on that? Well, I mean, I think psychedelics are really interesting because they're a way to give yourself some real plasticity and like break your context, right? But I think there's a little bit too much focus on like psychedelics specifically. Like I think that I'm interested in like anything that like breaks my existing context, give myself like a fresh perspective. And so, you know, I it's like anything can do that, like just taking a day into a meditation retreat or traveling or you know, I fast thing for extended periods of time or breath work. There's like infinite modalities for like things I can break your context and like make you see things from a different angle. And I think those are all, you know, very interesting. Psychedelics, I mean, yes, like I, I'm a, you know, recommend them, I guess, but like I think that there's a little bit more like I'm I think there's like one tool and like an arsenal of things that you can do for yourself. But to be clear with alcohol, do you view that as a tool as well? I mean, alcohol is a tool, right? It's a tool like numbs things for you. And it's just like a not a very good one. That's not very good for you, right? So I was using alcohol as a tool for a long time. It's like kind of like I do profan or something but worse, right? Like I'd be like, oh, I have feel terrible about something, right? Like my startup or my relationship or whatever, something. So like what's the remedy? I'm going to like go drink a lot and then I'd like not think about it right now. And what was the moment that changed that when when did you come to the moment where you knew that I didn't need to do that anymore? I mean, a couple years ago, I mean, I just realized I had 10,000 hours in or probably tens of thousands of drinks. And I realized like that's not doing anything for me. I just feel bad afterwards. And you know, it's that I've kind of exhausted every possible angle of like trying to, you know, fix things in my life without alcohol. And it's like it doesn't work. And I, you know, there's some like health consequences. You know, I wasn't like that bad off there. But like, you know, it's not like, you know, I wake up feeling horrible and I occasionally do something incredibly dumb. And like this is not a great lifestyle. Like I'm not a great person. I'm not the person I want to be what I'm drinking. Thank you, Justin. I'm going to go to Q&A in about five minutes. But just one. So gang, if you have any other questions, start posting them. Justin, one of the themes for Stanford this year is a focus on principle driven entrepreneurship. And what we mean by principle driven entrepreneurship is having a value besides just making money to dictate the decisions on how you on on on building new ventures. What's your view when it comes to principle driven entrepreneurship and how important is that? To you. Yeah, I think I'm primarily interested in principle driven entrepreneurship now. Right? Like everything I'm working on because it's and it's it's like, what are the things that give me joy that I'm excited about doing? Like I only want to do those things. And so, you know, with all the startups that I'm creating now, you know, working on now, they're like connected to something that I like care about in the world. And so Justin, just play devil's advocate. How do you reconcile that with, you know, many people would argue that Twitch is as phenomenal as it is. It's also responsible for a lot of mental unhealth because it's it's it's it's it's twitch has created a very addictive platform for built on this monetization engine. When you look at twitch, do you feel do you what what what if that's true? And you can let me know if that's not true. But if that's true, how do you perceive your relationship to twitch? Do you feel proud of it? Is it mixed? Any comments or I don't feel that way about twitch? You know, like unlike Instagram or something like that or Facebook, right? Which I think is. Questionably good for the world. You know, like I think twitch is is feels a need and it allows people to connect with each other in a much more human way. Like with twitch, you're not like presenting your just your best, you know, face, right? Because it's like live and it's a life for hours and hours. So like people are seeing you in like all different contexts. And I think that it's like a lot more human and a lot more connected. So I in you know with twitch, we've allowed all these people to, you know, work like have this as a career or where you know, it's something like they were doing something that like they wanted to do much less before, you know. I remember one guy like early on he was like working at McDonald's or Walmart actually any quit Walmart to like become a full-time twitch streamer. And I was like, that's amazing, right? So I feel their product twitch. What I will say is that I think that the first wave of entrepreneurship, which I was a part of, this like internet entrepreneurship was about creating platforms and using technology to create something that value prime, where most of the value go crude to the platform, right? So I think Facebook and Instagram are like the ultimate examples of that, but twitch is in that vein as well. Like when we thought about like notifications and you know how to get people to stream more, it was all like centered around how do we do that for our own sake, right? Like and incidentally like with twitch, especially like we were trying to you know by empowering streamers, we knew that was our benefit, right? But it was like at the end of day we were empowering streamers because it's ultimately to our benefit. And I think there's an opportunity of entrepreneurship that's possible where now we use the same tricks and technology, you know, technological devices to empower people to like live their best lives and like to do something in service of the user. And so I'm like very inspired by you know apps like headspace or calm things like that where you know where we can that are like much more service of the end user. And like you know I started this app called Kin Habits, which is like a habit tracking app, like a social habit tracking app, which is obviously have formation and something that's really important to me. And with this like this app is like all over you know that that's why I started as like I could build something where I applied the things I learned from building social apps, right? Social sites to like help people be the best version of themselves, you know, beyond that you know, on their one-est journey. And so you know I think that I see a lot of entrepreneurship in that direction and that's very encouraging. It is it is. Just I'm going to go to the student questions now. The first question is there's an question from an anonymous attendee, which is when is the right time to give up on a startup? How do you know when it's not working the what considering it's not working the way you want to? When do you know to give up? Yeah I think you know people give up when they run out of ideas of what to do. I don't know if that's the right time or not but like that's what the practical you know the practical answer is like people give up when they run out of ideas. And so that's probably when you will give up. Let me just ask you Coral. Yeah. Yeah. Oh no keep going. Keep going. Just. No I don't have it. That's my only. Okay. Well that is a good insight. But um but just so with um you know Twitch got born out of Justin TV. When did you know that Twitch was get what was the moment when you knew that Twitch was going to be big? Yeah so what we did which I think was pretty good was internally people were not convinced which was ever going to be big because it was like you know there's 10 years ago gaming streaming like is that going to be a thing? Obviously gaming was really big on YouTube so there was like some hits hint to that but streaming I don't know so two of the co-founders of a company were like that's not going to be a thing we shouldn't work on it and Emmett was really one was driving it internally and what he you know what we did which I think was really smart was we agreed to set goals a priori so we were like okay if it grows x percent a month 15 percent a month for the first 12 months and 10 percent a month for the next 12 months then we think it's on track to be a really big thing you know because it was going to be as big as game trailers.com which is like the biggest video game video website at the time at 10 million M.A.U. and so after six months we agreed to measure and we measured and we had like well we were measuring the whole time but we like saw that we had been beating those benchmarks every month and that gave us the confidence to say like oh we should go all in on Twitch. Okay and when was the moment that you knew that and just to underscore that at that moment you guys it was it's easier it's easier to say yes to go on on to which then to say I'm going to kill Justin TV yeah is that fair to say yeah yeah Justin TV was like funding the whole yeah yeah yeah so we didn't kill it for a few years but I will say that's the easiest way to pivot it's just to say yes to something instead of having to say no to something but yeah so I had this I had this call with my friend we that was in person I with my friend with pivoting and start many times names Matt Sanchez he started this company called Samee and we were like how do you decide to pivot and he was like well I you know Justin TV the business was right making like millions of dollars a year we're like he was like well I wouldn't kill that business I would just work on this other thing just have a team work on this other thing internally and then set these milestones you know he's the one who gave us the idea for setting these milestones that if you get the milestones then go you know work on this other thing and I think that's really what gave us the confidence to go for it okay and with atrium when was the moment that you knew it was not going to take off well the problem was like it was kind of the same thing I ran out of ideas like that this it was I mean the TL the out we were generous it was a pretty like we were generating revenue it was like generating like 15 million dollars a year revenue but the problems at margins were terrible on it and I was like there were everything we tried to do improve it was like not working and then like the term was like it meant so it was like this is not a scalable venture business it's a business of some sort but it's just like not one that I would invest my own venture dollars in and so like then it didn't feel like you know I felt like I was just kind of making everyone do this Chinese fire drill to like you know until we ran out of money to like figure it out but like it wasn't working so it was like I don't and I didn't have any ideas on how to make it work anymore so at that point I was like we should we got a you know we should do something different okay the next question is how did you know it was the right time oh to sell Twitch oh how did you know it was the right time to sell Twitch do you regret selling Twitch based on its current valuation people now say it's worth 15 billion or more what were your thoughts Justin on yeah well I made a YouTube video about it you can go check that out on my YouTube channel but the you know when when I like I at the time like we had tried to sell some secondary shares for like 200 million dollars valuation in January and so you know when we kind of went through this whole process of selling potentially to Google and then Amazon and we ended up selling it for like nine or seven and you know that seemed like an outrageous amount at the time compared to like what our internal valuation for it was of course like turns out that was like a pretty good deal for them but at the end of the day like I have never regret about it you know it like the journey that I've been on both the success and the failure I feel like I've gotten so much about like from that those learnings personally that like I wouldn't have any other way then like I said like you know even if you if you whether you have ten million dollars 100 million dollars I'm not even the start lower whether you have five hundred thousand dollars ten million dollars 100 million dollars or billions of dollars like you can always have like you can always feel richer you can always feel poor you can feel content you can feel this content has nothing to do with the amount of money out of the bank there you go gang there you go we're going to move to the next question which is what are your thoughts on evidence based entrepreneurship versus intuitive entrepreneurship i.e. ideation execution based on customer discovery research iteration versus the oft romanticized knowing that your idea has potential even when others don't seem to agree well I think generally in the latter case when you know your idea has potential and other people don't agree hopefully it's because you're your own customer right like but sometimes it's because you just believe in that idea so much but you're not really the customer and it's easy to confuse those two things so I would you know if you can't get anyone to agree that it's a good idea or to try it like let's say you're like trying to build a prototype and you're like you know nobody will try it then and you can't find anyone that's probably not a good idea you know like even just a TV which sounded like a horrible idea we got people to try it we got like people were like oh this is cool like you know some like weird internet people you know internet weirdos would try it but like somebody wanted it and like you know maybe all the investors thought it was stupid which they did but like some set of people thought it was like a good idea right and so you know if you can't you should be able to find some you know it could be a very small set of people but you need to find some people who think it's a good idea I thought it was a good idea yeah and this story for the like class right like Robbie was the one who pushed Tim to make our you know that series A1 investment which basically saved the company you know we hadn't gotten that way from Tim we would you know Tim Draper we wouldn't have gotten our existing investors to come in with like a much bigger slug I think and and kind of give them confidence so you are indirectly responsible for twitch existing I think in some way I'm honored to be the catalyst that was just the catalyst but yeah thank you um next question Justin is how would you say Justin.tv evolved to become twitch.tv and what was the process of changing feet what was the process of changing features like were you were their features that changed that you really had enjoyed or others that you were added that were added that you disagreed with I mean I think the process like with Justin TV the problem was like we didn't talk to our customers very much and then Emmett was like hey we need to talk to our customers they're the streamers that people are creating content and we're going to figure out what they want which was kind of obvious and retrospective we should do but like he was very innovative for us to do at the time because before that we just built all the features that we thought we wanted and we were like not building anything that actually like anyone used and so with twitch like that was the that was the method and we just at first it was just a part of Justin TV's site it was just the gaming category but we build like gaming specific features and um you know like a lot of them internally were not with skepticism but they were important right like one of them was like having a partner program where we paid people for their streams and at internally we're like what we we're barely making money ourselves how can we afford to pay people any meaningful amount it turns out like for a lot of these gaming streamers they didn't need to make that much for to be meaningful at first and so you know by talking to our customers we really learned what they wanted and started building those things and you know yeah there was disagreement but at the end of the day one of the things I think we did really well was let Emmett be the product person for twitch and he you know he figured it out and we kind of deferred to him. Next question as you develop brainstorm new ideas how do you know if it's worth pursuing what do you do to determine if the product has product market fit? Well at the brainstorming side you probably don't know if it has product market fit or not so it's really just an idea right you really have to like have some version of the product out there to like really know people that they want it right because people say that's a cool idea or they'll say like no I don't care but you don't really know until you like have it out there and so I think that like you know for me it's a lot of it is exploring do I like this like what do we think about this idea talking it through with smart people you know testing talking to talking to potential customers and seeing what they say and then prototyping something and trying to get it out there and iterating you know in public. So David thanks Justin. Next question what is your advice for fostering and maintaining meaningful relationships? I so love that question. I love that question so for me you know I spent my whole life wanting like meaningful deep relationships with people you know when I was a kid I felt like I was an outsider right and so as an adult I was like if I just become successful then it will attract people to me and to some extent that's true but you know we mean that people want I don't want to know me or talk to me like well I was you know after becoming successful and invite me to speak if there are you know technology entrepreneurship class or whatever but at the other end of it like you know they mostly want something from you right which is a little different of a relationship not bad necessarily but different and what I learned more recently is like you know in last couple years is like oh I could just have what I wanted which is the meaningful connections with people all along if I just I'm curious about people like I if I view people through the ones of curiosity if I just like talk to them about instead of just the world of ideas or what startups are investing in or building or whatever and I'm just like curious about who they are as people and view them as someone I can work from and you know like I mean it's kind of a lame story but I started doing that and then you know my relationship got way better right like so I guess my advice for for that is is you know it's all about it's all about developing and genuine curiosity for people around you and you know what's interesting is you can learn something from anyone like you know if I'm like the person who's driving you around in Uber or like you know you're barista at a coffee shop or whatever like there's something to learn from anybody if you just listen you know and that's what I like ever since I started adopting that attitude I like feel like my relationships have become just much more meaningful the other thing I would say is I've like invested in just you know thinking about who are the type of people I want to be more like you know and surrounding myself with those kind of people you know everybody I want to spend time with is somebody where some aspect of the behavior or something that I want to model my own life and I feel like that has improved my relationship a lot and Justin you are intrinsically curious soul to begin with because what I'm curious about isn't the is the other lesson also that you've allowed yourself to lean into being who you really are and you know who you really are right now and you're allowing that out in an unfettered way yeah I think that's probably a good lesson yeah I think I've always done that in some way but I think I really have embraced it probably turned it up to you know the maximum level now yeah I mean I think I think Justin can be very cavalier but I think he's one of the most curious souls and real students of business that that I know and he does a real service even though it may be belied by all of his actions but I think it's I think he's very curious I say that just because the lesson is to do what is you Justin is curious and he's and that's what I think what appeals to him so but I don't want to interject next question what do you think is the value for STEM skills slash knowledge in starting up what does someone with a non-stem background need to keep in mind in terms of navigating a tech-centric startup landscape well I mean like so obviously technology that like basically tech is the innovation that's power a lot of like Silicon Valley startups right a lot of like the Silicon Valley ecosystem is like connecting things with the internet and like you know enabling new business models by the internet and like websites and mobile apps and you know now cryptocurrencies or whatever right so you know that's like the obviously if you have the skills to build that stuff like that is kind of like a core foundational thing for any like technology product and obviously there are other startups that have sat on top of innovations that have happened in technology like the whole D to C revolution like all these people selling metal all birds or whatever that that's enabled because people have been able to market in a different way on the internet right through Facebook or whatever and so there's you don't have to necessarily have just a STEM only you know there's like lots of opportunities for entrepreneurship that don't involve like learning how to program but if you do not program it's like a very useful skill for you to you know sort of company that's in the technology space actually I think it's useful in general to like you know even if you're starting company not in the technology space because it's programming gives you a framework for how to get leverage on your time right by building programs and do stuff so you know I think it's good you should learn it if you don't but if you don't want to and you don't where you don't it can't you know there's lots of other skills that are necessary and starts like I don't program things anymore like what I'm good at is I'm a great storyteller I'm great at fundraising and recruiting and you know stuff like that those are new things that are necessary and starts of like figure out what is a genuine thing that you are great at that you love to do and you know there's probably a place for that and starts like I mean even art right like someone now like with everybody's making NFTs right like and there's always like NFT communities that are basically startups or you know start crypto projects and like that's very fueled by the art out in it right so like there's something for everybody that's in the world of starts and technology we might have temporarily one more question and there's two that are tied so I'm going to exercise my prerogative I'll ask the other one if we have time to but the question is do you think if you had started with your current self no compare that is no comparisons to others you would still get to where you are now isn't ambition and comparison the driver of success I think ambition and comparison is a driver of success I also think curiosity and joy can be a driver right like I'm still doing things that I think are going to be successful and probably economically successful I hope but I'm not doing them because I'm like oh I'm going to make as much money as X or I'm not like you know I've got to buy a buyer like I'll be feel disaccomplished it's more like because it's pure you know it's like I'm interested in seeing what the world like when these things exist and it's something that I like to work on it's and it's a creative pursuit for me so I actually think I would have been more successful if I had been more comfortable with myself and with what I was good at and not always reaching for something else and my direct example is with Twitch you know Emmett was running the product he was really the product visionary and really the driver behind Twitch so like for the last 10 years or whatever I'm just been credit current claiming Emmett's success really Emmett gets all the credit you know we had but like at the end of like I end up starting another company and kind of moving to like just be on the board of Twitch after a couple of years and what I should have probably done from an EV perspective just like to maximize if I was interested in maximizing outcome was like I should have probably just stuck around and helped him raise money because I was really good at raising money and he was like hated it and consequently because it was hard to raise money that was one of the factors in selling so you know it could have been the case that like maybe I just let my ego go and I was like oh you know it's okay if I'm not the CEO of this company it's okay if I'm like have a job that's less important or seemingly less important than my friend who's on the co-founder and I just like you know work for whatever a month or two months or three months a year raise money and then like I don't know hang around the company or sit on the beach or anything and like that might have been like made me much more successful you know at the end of the day but instead I was very ego driven I was like oh I got to like be the man I'm I mean to be number one and so then I was like driven to do something that ultimately you know was not that successful but it's all good like that's a learning you know the
