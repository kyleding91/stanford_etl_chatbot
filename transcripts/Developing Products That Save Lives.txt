Richard Scheller is the head of R&D and Genentech. But I have known him for a very long time, although he doesn't actually remember it. He started at Stanford as a faculty member in 1982 and in the neuroscience department and in biology. And that was the year that I was a first year PhD student over there. So I took classes from him and it's absolutely amazing to see the trajectory of his career. He spent 19 years at Stanford and then went to Genentech. He's been there 10 years. And he's got some incredible insights about the difference between research in academia and in industry and we're going to dive right in. So welcome. Thank you very much for joining us. And maybe you could tell us a little bit about your story and about moving from academia. What would motivate you and tell us a little bit about how that happened? Okay. I'm going to stand up if that's okay. Thanks for having me. I was a professor here for 19 years. I was a successful member of the National Academy. I was a huge investigator. So I had plenty of money. Things were going well. But the research that I was doing had gone through a phase where the knowledge had just exploded over the last decade. And the rate of learning started to sort of plateau a little bit. So I just took stock in where I was headed with the rest of my career and thought that I had to do one of a couple of things. Find some new technology to increase that rate of learning again or switch my field to a little bit something different where I felt was sort of prime for that tremendous gain of knowledge again. Or maybe just do something different. So my wife who's on the faculty here and I thought should we move to Boston? You know, go to Boston and have a bunch of nice colleagues there and then have labs there. But it really wouldn't be very different than here given that we didn't have any problems here. We loved that here. So I thought if I was going to do something different and move somewhere since being a professor here is terrific, that I should really move somewhere where it would be quite different. So I thought then, well, what would that be? It seemed to me that we had done and when I say we in this case, I mean the life science endeavor, not my lab. So everything funded by NIH for years and years. It's sort of done what we promised the society that we would do, which is learn enough about the way cells work and the way tissues work, enough about molecular biology so that we could actually think about disease in very, very mechanistic terms, which is the way I like to think. And wouldn't it be interesting to try and apply my biological insights to disease? So I was fortunate enough then to have somebody, David Botsdino, who was in the genetics department at the time, had worked at Genintec. He kind of heard I was looking around at different things. He introduced me to the CEO of Genintec at the time, Art Levinson. And Art was a scientist. Started off in the lab at Genintec, became the CEO. And I thought, wow, you know, if I'm going to actually have a boss, which is kind of a novel concept if you're a faculty member. Now, if I'm going to have a boss, it should be someone who's a scientist who can actually understand logic and things like that and someone that I could talk to. So it seemed like a terrific challenge, a terrific opportunity, and that it would be really, really different from what I was doing day to day at Stanford. So I remember over the Christmas holiday, 10 years ago thinking, you know, should I do this? Should I do this? Walking into the lab and thinking, it's so nice here, my god, I have 10 years. Should I do this? What if they fire me? You know, I could get fired if I go there. You know, these were all kind of novel notions to think about. But it just seemed like a terrific opportunity, and I took the plunge. And I have to say for me, personally, it was the right thing to do. My learning curve picked up again immediately, learning about all kinds of new science about cancer biology. I didn't really know that. My new self biology, but I didn't know specifically about cancer or immunology. I knew absolutely nothing about business. I was on the executive committee of the company. You know, I had to find out what EPS stood for. So really, the executive committee meetings were just learning all about business, all about drug development. How do you develop a drug? I'd never thought of that before. So this was just absolutely fascinating. And I have to say, I give the company a lot of credit because it basically, I think it's paid off for them. But it took me two years before I had any idea what I was even doing in business. I mean, I knew about science, but it really was a steep learning curve, but not something that happens overnight. So for me personally, I would say, I took the leap because I wanted to do something different, and I felt it was the right time to become basically a human experimental biologist, which is what we do all in the context of disease, of course. So. I want to build on something you just said because you said you were curious about what it felt like to have a boss. But you also now have 2,000 people working for you. How did you learn how to be a boss of that many people? I mean, that's got to be a huge challenge to manage a team that size. Well, that was part of the two years of learning, and that was probably the biggest part. One of the huge differences is I found that, you know, in business, you actually get feedback on how you're doing. I'm like, I'm sorry, I'm like here at least when I was a professor, you might see your chairman in the hall every year or so. But you basically did your own thing, and I mean, nobody really provided you with much feedback. So one of the things that I did there was someone said to me, you should meet the head of HR. And I said, what does that stand for? Honestly, I had no idea what that stood for. There's a human resource. As I said, oh, human resources. So that kind of sounded to me like the most higher the people. So then someone explained to me what HR is, and you know, they do all sorts of things and so on. So I learned. But one of the things that the executive committee of Genentech at the time decided to do was to collect 360 feedback from our peers and folks that work for us and sort of tell us, you know, how we're doing. So this was really a novel experience for me. So I was my first 360 feedback. Let me see if I can remember. They said I was a loof, arrogant, and dismissive. You know, and I said, of course I am. You know, how do you think I survived as a scientist? You know, it was a competitive arena. But they said, well, you know, BS, but that's probably not going to work here. So what we'd like you to do is then to go discuss your 360 feedback with your reports and one level down, your directors. So I said, well, wow. OK, we'll go do that. So I went into the room with these people. And I knew that, you know, it's mostly these people that said that I was those things, which is I didn't know anyone specifically who said it. Of course, it was anonymous. But I said, well, gee, you know, you say people say I'm a loof, dismissive, and arrogant. And I can't, you know, I can't understand this. I mean, my parents said that. My wife says that. My colleagues at Stanford say that. You know, you say that. I cannot figure out how you're all wrong in the same way. So basically found that you need to be a much better listener. You need to really, really respect folks in their opinions. But it is very, it is different in industry compared to being here. And I think part of the reason that people found me quite brash was the fact that here, when I said something, nobody actually did what I said. Or, you know, hopefully they at least marginally considered it. But then they would go, not really. I mean, postdocs, students, and then they go, really what they wanted to do. Which was fine. So I took that attitude to geninteck and actually found very quickly that, well, I didn't really want the atmosphere of the company to be that way, that it is just different. And it is somewhat more hierarchical. And that people actually do what you say. So you have to be really careful with what you say. Because folks take it incredibly seriously. So it is just a million little things like that that you learn over time about how it is different in industry versus academia. That was the reason I say that it took me two years before I felt as though I was coming to a place where I really knew what I was doing and could be sort of optimally productive. So there is no real one thing that I can say that I learned. But I hope I gave you kind of a couple of examples there of what I would say would be a list of a thousand things if I wrote them all down. So maybe you could tell us a little bit about what your responsibilities are. I mean, ahead of R&D, a large biotech company, it sounds very impressive. But maybe you can give us some insight in what your real responsibilities are. So I am in charge of discovering medicines that will make a real difference in people's lives. So as you may know, Jean-Intech is now an incorporated company in the United States, but 100% owned by a large Swiss drug company called Roche. But our group is completely independent. And our job is to discover medicines that make a difference. We don't make any generic drugs. We don't make any copies of other drugs. Innovation is our, we're going to live or die based on innovation. We also believe very strongly in the view of personalized medicine, that is making medicines that are tailored to individuals. The Roche group owns two businesses, a pharmaceutical business and a diagnostic business. It's a very large, I don't know, maybe fourth, fifth largest pharmaceutical in this company in the world, in the largest diagnostic company in the world. So the idea is to make medicines that are really, really deliver benefit, tangible, terrific benefit for people. So if we make a medicine for somebody with cancer, we have to show that they actually live longer when they take the medicine, for example. So I oversee research. So our research group is about 1300 folks. We have about 150 of the people are postdocs. And why would we have a postdoc program? People come through, they come from all over the world, they stay for four or five years, they bring in new techniques and ideas, they're not cynical yet. They work at night and in the weekends and it's just that it just energizes the place. Then we have scientists at various levels. And the job of the scientists is to our twofold, to do basic science. We like to give each of our scientists somewhere, some what we call discretionary time. You know, maybe it's somewhere between 10 and 30% of their time. So it depends on the individuals. Some people, frankly, it's 100%. But that's a different topic. And with their discretionary time, they're supposed to just do interesting things, do whatever you want. Make a discovery, publish a paper. We publish 20 papers in science nature and sell last year, hundreds of papers overall from the company. But the other real tangible, deliverable of the scientists is to come up with a medicine and move that medicine into what we call early development. And in early development, the compound goes through various further stages of testing to make sure that it's safe. We do all of the work to file an IND. That's a new drug application with the FDA. Then we file the IND and then we do the clinical studies. Phase one and phase two. And phase one, you usually just treat patients and make sure that the drug is safe. You start at a very, very low dose. I mean, imagine putting something into a human that's never been in a human before. You slowly escalate the dose. It depends on the disease. Sometimes it'll be in patients with the disease. Sometimes not. But then usually in phase two, you do a relatively small number of patients, but enough patients so that you have statistical power to see that you're making a difference in the disease. And what we then do would be to, if the phase two trial works, to hand the medicine to then the global development group to do the final clinical testing. And the final clinical testing would then be done in 80 countries around the world. It's a logistical, absolute nightmare. It's done in many, many more patients so that the statistical power increases dramatically. And then work with the regulatory authorities to get permission, if you will, so the FDA in the case of the United States permission to market the drug. So my job is to deliver molecules that we say have gone through proof of concept. We believe that they work. We have the chemical entity. We know that it can be manufactured and to hand this to the global group where there's a lot of science involved, but there's a huge amount of logistics and regulatory involvement. And that's when the commercial people get involved and so on. And frankly, I'm less interested in that. I then go back and try and discover a new medicine and show that it works. So can I chime in here? Because I think it would be fascinating to everyone to know how many of these you generate, how long it takes, and how many you're actually successful. I mean, this is a very complex process and how many sort of pop out at the other end as successful? Yeah, well, this is a tough business. So I would say from the concept of maybe this molecule would work in this disease to actually marketing the drug is what depends. If it went incredibly fast, it could be 10 years. It's more like 15 years. And the average cost is about one and a half billion dollars to get it to the market. Now, the one and a half billion includes the failures. So let's take it into account. So how many make it? Well, that varies from company to company. I would say probably on the average 10% make it. For us, it's probably more like 25%. But I think the industry is going to do much, much better in the next decade. And the reason is that there's been an explosion in knowledge about biology. What I think was happening in the industry in the 80s and the 90s, there were a bunch of successes. Drug companies, Merck Fizer, Roche, they were making tons of money. And then they're saying, but we got to stay a growth company. We need to grow. So they gave a lot of money to heads of R&D. But frankly, there weren't very good targets. But what is ahead of R&D supposed to do? Say, I don't know what to do. There aren't very good targets. You take the money back. No, of course not. They spent the money on lousy targets. But during that time, there was a tremendous revolution in the understanding of biology that was taking place, which as I said, is partially why I moved to industry. And I think that now there are incredible targets that we work on. Think about cancer. You take the cancer, you take the tumor, you sequence the DNA of the tumor, and you sequence the DNA of the normal tissue, and you find out what genes are mutated, what genes are actually causing the cell to be a cancer cell, and then it target those. Is that going to work? Yes, it's going to work. If they are working, we know they work. But that is just terrific sort of preclinical validation. Those are the kinds of things that you want to work on versus not knowing. Not knowing what to work on. It's an expensive and difficult process. So also, the industry is facing a lot of headwinds from various countries, including our country, on being willing to pay for prescription drugs. Some of our drugs are extremely expensive. If we make a drug for a certain cancer in their 10,000 patients per year, it's not unusual to charge 50, 60,000 dollars a year for the drug, which we have to in order to basically recoup the investment. But look, if you're going to live longer, we think it's delivering value. So there's a lot of pressure on payers and a lot of pressure in Europe as well. I voted for Obama, but he's charging Jean-Intech $550 million this year to pay for Obama care. Where do we get $550 million? We fired $550 million worth of people. I mean, where else are we going to get the money? So now they don't have jobs or health care. But these are the kinds of things that all companies are going through. There have been thousands and thousands of people laid off from the pharmaceutical industry because of the pressure on pricing and the rebates that people are asking for. And I think this is what happens during tough economic times. But there's a price that's paid for that and our ability to develop new drugs. So let me drill down on this question of small markets. I know there's a big interest in personalized medicine, which is like the smallest market you can get. It's just for the one person. It's very personalized. How interested is Jean-Intech in this? And I mean, what are the consequences, both for the market, for the cost, for the consumer? Yeah. Well, as I said, we've staked the whole company on the idea of personalized medicine, but that doesn't mean it's for one individual. That, of course, wouldn't work. So for instance, we market a drug called herceptin, which is for about 20% of patients' women with breast cancer. And this drug is extremely effective in these 20% of women. And there's a test to know whether the gene that is the target of this drug is amplified. So in most of your cells, you have two copies of this gene. And 20% of women with breast cancer, you have about 1,000 copies of this gene, and the drug is extremely effective. So 20% of breast cancer, I forget what the worldwide sales of herceptin was last year. You can look it up, but it's something like $3 billion. So that's not so bad. But you're right. As we get down to smaller and smaller populations, the market becomes smaller and smaller. So two things happen. First of all, our failure rate will go down. We understand more about the disease, more about the molecule, more about the target. So the drug, we believe, that the drug will more, our clinical trials will be more successful. Number one, number two, if the drug really works, and you know what patients to treat, you drive penetration. So almost every woman in the United States that has her two positive breast cancer gets herceptin. It would be sheer malpractice, not to prescribe herceptin. So we have a sales force. But boy, I'm going to get real trouble with this time. We have a sales force, but doctors would use it anyway. Because they know that it works really well, and this is the standard of care. So we expect that there'll be a higher success rate, deeper penetration into the markets with the personalized healthcare approach. We will also market the test as part of the Roche group, which will help with earnings. Although the diagnostic business is very different than the pharmaceutical business in terms of margins and so on. So you talk about failure a second ago. And let's talk about that a little bit. Because we all know that if you're going to take some risks and some big risks, you're going to have a higher chance of failure. But these risks, if they work out, you're going to have some really big hits. So how do you encourage that type of innovation and risk taking in the organization if people know that, well, if I failed, this is going to be an incredibly, incredibly expensive failure. So there must be a lot of tension between that, or how do you walk that line, trying to encourage risk taking in innovation and not wanting to have some big failures? Yeah. Well, we just have to accept that you're going to have big failures. I mean, we have a portfolio, a balanced portfolio approach. So for instance, in the phase three portfolio now has 13 new molecular entities. So with that, that's a new compound. I say 13 because there are probably 50 clinical studies going on. Sometimes the molecules are tested in more than one type of cancer, for example, and those are separate studies. So 13 new molecular entities, each one has, by that stage, each one has a commercial value associated with it. That's also getting better, but those are usually wrong. I mean, the drug that we sell, the elitic for dissolving blood clots was supposed to be a several billion dollar drug, and it sells 200 million a year. And a drug for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was supposed to be a couple hundred million a year, and last year was the largest selling drug in the Roche group, and so it's $6 billion. So it's just an opposite of what the commercial predictions were, but that's getting, that's better now than it was 10 years ago. So we have a commercial value associated with each molecule, and then we have associated with that a probability of technical success, a probability that the molecule will work in phase three. And we take that all the way back, even to the portfolio that I manage in phase one, where we have a probability of technical success of the molecule getting to the market. So what's the probability? We'll make it through phase one, probability through phase two, phase three, through regulatory. Obviously, as a molecule moves through the pipeline, the probability goes up, as it passes one hurdle in the next hurdle and the next hurdle. So we have a portfolio with known value for each molecule, and a probability of the molecule is working, and then we balance the portfolio with more risky projects, and projects that we feel are close to a slam dunk if there ever is such a thing in our business, and manage the portfolio that way. So I know that there are a lot of drug companies that outsource their R&D. They have lots of little small drug companies that are trying lots of risky things, and when they get down the pipeline, they license it or buy it, or buy the company. Do you guys do that, or do you ever outsource R&D? Well, the short answer is sort of. We're very good at R&D. A genentech, we're very proud of that, and I think that a lot of companies have lost their way in terms of their research and development, and frankly, don't have the quality of scientists that we have. I guess I can say that if I don't mention any particular companies. So they have to look outside for their molecules. Now, if you're going to start a biotech company, you can get some scientists together, you can do some experiments, you can maybe raise enough money to get a molecule into the clinic. But remember, as you start doing the later stage experiments, these experiments cost hundreds of millions of dollars, and it's unlikely that any small company, I would say it's not unlikely, it is impossible nowadays that any small biotech company would be able to raise enough money to do its own large phase three clinical trial. So the companies have to partner with larger pharmaceutical companies, which have the resources to do that. So well, we have 1,300 scientists set an intact, that doesn't include the clinical groups and so on. Well, however many scientists we have, we will always be a small part of the overall life science industry. And I have a business development group that reports to me, there's 25 people. Many have PhDs in MBAs, some have MDs, PhDs in MBAs, I'm undereducated. Compared to some of these people, and they have the world divided up into territories, and we're constantly looking to in license innovation that comes from outside of genintech. So we're very, very, very, very conscious that we don't have all the good ideas and we don't invent all the good things. Hopefully we're somewhat less dependent on it than some of the other pharmaceutical companies whose R&D may not be quite as good, where they, as you said, almost solely depend now on in licensing. And actually, some of the companies have so much money and are getting so desperate because of the drugs coming off of patents. When a drug comes off of a patent and becomes generic, if it's a simple chemical, not a protein antibody. If it's a simple chemical, the generic companies move in and basically the innovator price falls by usually about 10 fold in six months. And there's huge, huge patent expertise coming in the industry so people are quite desperate right now. So I would say a lot of it, but they've made a ton of money off of these small fuels over the last decade. So they'll now go into a small company and say, look, we don't want to license it. How much do you want? We'll buy you. And that can be a very lucrative model for start-up biotechs if you can bring a molecule into the clinic and interest a large pharmaceutical company in the molecule and start with, I say, 20 or 50 million dollars of capital and sell the company five or seven years later for half a billion dollars. So it's not bad. If to be successful to do that. Yeah. Very interesting. Well, let's go back to academics for a little bit in the comparison between academic and commercial drug development. When you're in academics, your lifeblood is grants. And you're getting grants mostly from the government, but probably also from some drug companies as well. And such a small percentage of people get them. And let's talk about the efficiency of that versus being in a company where you have a very different model. Do people inside Genotech have to actually compete for money and resources? Is there any parallel inside a company to what people might be familiar with in an academic setting? Yeah. So just think of me as the NIH. Not that. Yeah. So there's never enough money to do all of the ideas that you'd like to do. So even though we have a very nice budget, we do have things that we can't do. There's never enough postdocs for folks. But we fund each of the, so a typical scientist entering scientist, that Genotech, will have a postdoc in say two technicians. And we ask our scientists to, they don't teach, they don't have to raise money by writing grants. We ask our scientists to actually still work in the lab. Whereas an assistant professor here, at least my experience was some years ago, well, very quickly, at least in the life science, have teaching and grant writing and going around and giving talks. So it'll be very hard to actually stay in the lab very long. So we ask our scientists to really work in the lab. We fund everyone about the same. It's really FTE-driven. And as you might become a senior scientist or go on to be what we call a staff scientist, the laboratories can grow to, you know, five or ten people. But again, people are treated fairly, fairly similarly, although certainly somewhat dependent on the project that you're working on if it's particularly hot or important. And there's some, says something that we could help by money to shorten the timelines. We would review that and understand that. Each of, even at the research stage, each of the translational projects have timelines. We have goals. We have certain expectations that we try and meet on a monthly or yearly basis. So there's somewhat more, there's quite a bit more organized than at least my laboratory was, which functioned a lot more on sort of churn. I mean, I meet with people and I'd say, let's try and get that done in a couple of weeks or something. The scientists wouldn't come and make a presentation and have at the end a timeline for when we might expect that something would move into clinical development. But we have to have that again in order to manage a portfolio and manage a flow of molecules through a pipeline. So it's, let me see, but I think that we don't waste money, but it's not a money, because money doesn't hold back our best ideas at all. And we don't spend a lot of time, well, I spend time with the CEO, haggling about my budget. But none of the 2,000 people who work for me spend very much time worrying about money, really. That's terrific. So I'm going to ask one more question and then I'm going to open it up to the audience. So you can spend the time thinking about your provocative questions you want to ask to Richard Scheller. So let's go back to when you were in school. I love the fact that you started talking about the fact that you ended up in this position and it took two years to really get up to speed. And a lot of the students here are lucky enough, even when they're getting a technical education to get exposure to courses on business-related topics, like strategy and marketing and finance and leadership. One sort of things do you wish you had learned when you were in school? What would have been the most valuable things that would have helped you really hit the ground running when you were walking into a really important leadership position? People ask that. And I think any time that I would have spent getting an MBA, for example, wouldn't have been worth it. I really think that the reason I was hired is because I was a really, really good scientist and taking, you notice, the was. Taking any time away from that would have been, would have frankly been a mistake, I think. And the only reason our company will be successful in the future is if the right technical decisions are made. And people don't get that. I mean, you can't, you know, you can't. It all depends on the science. If we pick the wrong target, if we make the wrong molecule, if we choose the wrong disease, and we try and develop it, and it doesn't work over and over and over again, the company is finished. It's all driven by the scientific decisions that are made at the early stages and through development. You know, you can have all, I mean, we need the commercial folks. They're terrific. I love going to the sales meeting and the manufacturing people and the finance folks. And you know, that's all absolutely critical. But if the science is wrong, there's no foundation. There's no basis for the company. So I think just becoming the absolute best scientist that I could be in being just so focused on that was actually the best use of my time to be the best head of R&D. So nothing. Nothing different. So what's the problem? What you're saying is. I'm not serious. No, what you're saying though is it was the best use of your time to basically learn it on the job as needed. As needed when you basically threw yourself in and you got just in time knowledge from the people who... Because if those are the scientific decisions out of the executive committee room, if the scientific decisions weren't right, no basis for the company. You know, that had to be there. So... Very terrific point of view. Okay, so any questions? Great. Right here. So can you talk a little bit about sort of the balance of how much innovation is done from packaging the universities, the commercials sectors in terms of like what a drug is released or what's how much of the effort was from the actual drug manufacturer versus say, fun meal, discoveries from... Sure. So, Richard, will you repeat the questions so that everyone can hear? To talk a little bit about how much of the balance between academia and the industry input into a drug. So when a drug is released, who did the work basically? So it varies drug to drug. I mean, some drugs we discover the target, we make them molecule, we do all the development and the contribution from academia is pretty much what I would call zero. The... In cancer, for example, now a lot of targets are found. Somebody sequences eight years ago, PI3 kinase and finds that it's mutated in 30% of breast cancer. We read that in nature and we say, oh, that's probably a good target. But then we do all the work on making the drug and testing it and so on. So that's sort of, I would say, intermediate. So the major discovery was made in academia, but the company does all the work to develop the drug. And then there are other situations where someone in academia may make a monoclonal antibody and they may show in a model of some... Mouse model of some disease that this monoclonal antibody seems to... Seems to help with the disease. They may then license it to genetic and we would... Excuse me, take a drink. We would then take it from there, so usually into the clinic. So I think it's very rarely the case that... Not impossible, but rarely the case that an academic would take a molecule on their own into clinical testing. For instance, to take a monoclonal antibody into humans just to do the process development of getting the molecule, you know, it has to be GMP made and approved by the FDA and put in bottles and so on before it can go into it. It's $25 million. So that's a hard thing for most academics to do without some kind of industry sponsor. So that's an idea. Great. Yep. Once you get a molecule working, how do you disseminate that knowledge among 2000 scientists? What are your knowledge mechanisms? So the question is once we get a molecule working or really basically once we do anything, how do we disseminate information? So we have a variety of ways. We have a web, of course, for what we call genetic research and early development. So we post clinical findings there once they're made public. We post publications that are made. Clinical scientists and basic scientists give seminars. We also give a lot of seminars outside of the research and early development group. We have a program we call G-RED, so that's Shinin tech research and early development revealed where we go and we give talks around the whole company to the finance group, to the sales folks about the kinds of things that we're doing. So I think pretty standard things, web-based applications and seminars and so on. A lot of the data, a lot of the data actually eventually comes out in press releases and people see that we post that everybody gets an email every day with the press releases that have come out. We have to announce material things to the investment community in a very regulated way so that everybody finds out at the same time so that certain people don't find out ahead of time and manipulate the stock and so on. So people get an email every day with the press releases. Those things are kept somewhat confidential until then just because once you tell your few thousand best friends somebody's going to be at a cocktail party with a broker and have three martinis and you know then can actually get in trouble for that kind of thing if you're not careful. So question back there. Yes, thank you for coming. My question, you mentioned your kind of introverted nature when you were in the research and acting in the research, I would think is generalizable and now you manage all the fleet of people who focus on research. So my question is I'd love to hear about how you motivate such a workforce that might not be as externally motivated and how do you incentivize that. So the question. The question is how I'm sort of inward looking and coming from academia and so on, worked in a lab sort of with my students and so on but now thousands of people that work for me. How do we motivate? How do someone like me motivate folks? So at Genentech we actually have a, we work a lot on our culture. It's been a lot of time thinking about our culture. I have a, I have a leadership team and we motivate people by the fact that we are doing work that we believe will really, really help patients and sick people and if you think about, if I think about the kinds of molecules that we have in clinical development for things like Alzheimer's disease, asthma, cancer, infectious disease, psychiatric disorders, if our portfolio plays out reasonably successfully over the next decade, it could actually be the case that we will rather directly affect every family in the developed world. I mean, who doesn't know someone in their family that's had one of those diseases? So you know, to really, we really, really help patients and that is extremely motivating to me. You know, to unblind the clinical trial, especially an oncology clinical trial where you give half the patients the drug and half the patients the placebo and the endpoint is how fast they die. To unblind the clinical trial like that and to see that you've made a difference is really, really, you know, most, I mean, the room usually starts crying. It's just, it's really, really. So the first thing is meaningful work. We believe we do meaningful work and we talk about it. So I had a town hall last week, so all 2,000 people. We had a patient come and talk. Patient is taking a hedgehog inhibitor for, it's for a number of diseases, but largely basal cell carcinoma. This guy had a disease called Gorlin's disease. It's fairly rare, but it's a basal cell disease again where you get, you get large growths and if they're not, if they're not surgically removed, they can be, mostly they start on your face and then your trunk. They can, they had it as whole life. It can be fist size and he's a salesman. And he said, my whole life, I went out doing sales and I had big scars all over a chunk of his ear is gone, you know, and, you know, this, this is a targeted drug. It's a mutation in the pathway that gives rise to this disease. He takes our drug, all the lesions are gone. He hasn't had one since he started taking the drug. He was so thankful. So you know, I think that's, I think that's a big, big motivator for our industry and it's, you know, maybe a little different than other industries. I mean, I'm sure, you know, I love, I love iPhones, but you know, they don't save my, probably does save my life, actually, shouldn't say that. But you know, it's a little different. So I think that's really, you know, that's the number one thing and then we, you know, motivate people through. There's always compensation. So we have, you know, three components to our compensation, salary, stock and bonus. And we target salaries at the 50th percentile of the market and we have a target bonus that's at the 50th percentile, but there's tremendous upside, depending on the performance of the company and the performance of the individual. Now, did you move a molecule into the clinic? Did you publish a bunch of great papers where you, the lead clinical scientist on a phase two study where the design was terrific and it worked, you know, et cetera, et cetera. So bonus and of course, stock, which tracks with the overall performance of the company. So I think it's, I think those would be, I could talk about that for a long time, but I think those would be the two major things. Great. You mentioned basically two big differences between industry and academia as being first specificity that as a professor, you tell your students and first thoughts what to do and then come back some indeterminate time later and they may or may not have done it. And also feedback, which in academia, either going up or down is often either vague or lacking. Do you have any thoughts on how industry practices and cultures might potentially benefit academia in some ways? Yeah, I think that it would have been, I think it would have been better for me to have brought in some of the HR, if you will, you know, practices from industry into academia and have provided more direct feedback to have provided better career counseling. I don't think that, I don't think though that the way projects are managed would work as in industry, would work in academia. I don't think it would have helped to have timelines and things, you know, it's just sort of more rigor behind the organization of the projects. I think that the kind of spontaneous creativity that comes in industry with our people's discretionary time and in academia with the way projects are done, I think it's best to be a little less organized and to have some churn to it. You know, and I wish that I could even get sort of more churn into into geninteck and a little less sort of reverent kind of behavior. I think that would help with our ability to innovate career counseling. I think it's done more now at Stanford than it was 10 years ago when I left. I spoke what three weeks ago over in the medical school. I think career counseling is an important thing that's done much better now in academia, this kind of forum than it was 10 years ago. We also talk about how we inspire people. We have a goal this year that of our 2000 people, 90 percent or more of the people have what we call a development plan. The manager sits down with a person, what do you want to do with your life? Where would you like to be in 10 years? Let's think about how we can get you there. Maybe it would help if you sat on this team or maybe it would help if you took this course or whatever. So everybody has a development plan, not that they'll all get to where they want to be, but so that they very clearly defined with their manager a plan to advance. So our people just say I love what I'm doing, I just don't want to be bothered, just leave me alone. I don't want a development plan. That counts in the 90 percent we tried. So I think that kind of thing brought back a little more formally into academia would be good. Being in the pharmaceutical industry, I guess you're faced with a lot of ethical issues. Say a drug can help a lot of people who are perhaps not profitable. How do you as a manager and as a leader manage those issues? Yes, absolutely. The... They're ethical issues every day. They're ethical issues, a lot of ethical issues around the clinical trials. And for example, if you have a drug that you're pretty sure is going to work, and you're required, we're required in a number of cases, by the FDA, to have a placebo group. And nobody wants to be in the placebo when we're doing a survival trial. Nobody wants to be in the placebo group. And one could question whether it's ethical to even have a placebo group, or whether you should just put everyone on the drug and compare it to historical standards, which of course is not as good an experiment. That's for sure, but these are real folks that you're treating. So a lot of our issues around our clinical trials are basically determined by the FDA, where they tell us, look, no placebo control, no approval, no drug for anybody. So we're required in a lot of cases too. And we often, often, sometimes disagree with the FDA on whether we should... It's ethical to have a placebo group, but in the end, they're the regulators, and they would rather be really, really sure that you have a drug that makes a difference that you can then market to hundreds or thousands or a million people, than to maybe for some folks not to get the drug early on, and to be sure in the end that it's a good drug. So a lot of our ethical issues around our clinical trials are determined by the regulatory agencies, and we basically just have to follow what they say. Now, in terms of drugs and their use in the third world, we wouldn't, frankly, we wouldn't try and make a drug for a third world country disease, because it's not profitable. Fortunately, there are groups like the Gates Foundation now that are putting the kind of money into those kinds of clinical development work that are starting to think more about that. But we just don't... We can't justify to the people that buy our stock every day that we're going to spend one and a half billion dollars and then give it away. That's for better or for worse, and that's not the way the Western world functions nowadays. If it's free enterprise that's going to determine what drugs are made, and it's a growth, hopefully driven business, I have to justify at the end that there's some return on the investment that I make. We do, in the United States, for example, though. It was really a bit of a fallacy that our healthcare system was so terrible. I mean, in terms of prescription drugs, if you have insurance-insurance-based, if you have insurance and you have to make a copayment, and sometimes on an expensive drug, the copayment can be more money than someone would have. So if you couldn't afford the copayment, we paid it. If you didn't have any insurance and you needed the drug, we just gave people the drug. So somebody wanted to do a 60-minute one, to do a story once on one of our expensive cancer drugs, and to find somebody that was dying because they couldn't get the drug and make us look bad, but you know what, they couldn't actually find anyone who wasn't getting the drug. So, you know, in that drug, we have given away, I don't remember what the number is, billion dollars worth of free drug. We spend a lot of money every year on copayments for folks. So we believe that at least in the Western world where we operate, that everybody has access to our drugs, even if we just give it to them for free. Great. I'm going to take one more question. Okay? Great. Speak up really bad. You said that you're hired because you're a very good scientist. How much science are you using your job versus management or leadership skills? And do you listen to your bad, really actually think like the hard course science and do you think you would ever go faster? Well, that's a good question. Well, so what did I do today? So at 9.30, I had a phone call with two scientists at the Cold Spring Harbor Lab in New York who have an idea about that they think would be useful in breast cancer from 10 o'clock for four hours. I went and heard a bunch of research presentations on our strategy and angiogenesis and so on. So most of what I do, as I said, is hearing about the science and the clinical trials. I have a model where there's a single decision, accountable decision maker. This is quite important for every decision that is made. So that in this research review committee meeting today, there were alternating chairs depending on the topic and the chair is the decision maker. The chair reports to me, but I don't decide unless I think that, unless the decision is really, really kooky and very, very expensive. I could overrule someone, but that rarely happens. So in terms of the decisions that are made throughout the group, I generally don't make them, but I need to feel as though I understand them and agree with them. So I'm in many of these scientific meetings hearing about the programs that we're going on and sort of course correcting this big ship maybe by a degree or two here and there when I need to. Now, I think that most of the leadership problems that I run into, it's more, you know, you can get a really, you can go really far in life with a little common sense. You know, and the kinds of leadership issues that come up, I just sort of resort back to my roots and my beliefs and why I'm at Genentech. If you keep patience in mind and if you're always doing the best thing for patience in your decisions, you know, usually just, it's usually just pretty clear what to do. So it's sort of hard for me to, sort of hard for me to say much more than that. And by the way, I have a small lab, so I have every Tuesday at noon, a lab meeting, and most of the higher level management people at Genentech have a lab, I think that's really, really important. Otherwise, it just gets, it gets too easy. It goes sit in some big room, someone makes a presentation, you say, you know, do this, spend some money here, do that, do that, do that. You know, you forget how hard it is to actually make an experiment work unless you're sitting with your lab group. You know, and you see, oh geez, it didn't work again, you know, what are we going to do? Let's, you know, it keeps you grounded in reality. So I think that's extremely important and I'm extremely proud of the fact that the high level scientists at Genentech still have labs and write papers and so on. What I want to come back, well, I don't know, you know, probably, probably not. And the reason is, I think the university works unbelievably well, given that it's just completely unclear who's in charge. And I don't think I could stand at them. I don't think I could stand at any more. I need to know. Well, you know what? I think we'll call that ad. I need to know who's in charge. And who's deciding. I'm going to be in charge right now. So I'm going to ask everyone to join me in a huge round of applause.
