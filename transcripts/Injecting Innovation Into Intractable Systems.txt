 You were listening to the DFJ entrepreneurial thought leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. So I am Tom Byers and I have the distinct pleasure of having a conversation with I am proud to say a friend of mine. Irene Powell Jobs. Welcome her please. Applause Our paths have crossed and she was kind enough to accept my invitation last fall to do this. So here we are. Yes. I got, at the time March seemed very far away so it was easy to say yes. Well, she, what's really interesting is I went up on the web and I started looking around and saying well you know I'll see what her style is and stuff like that because we made this decision to do a conversation rather than a town hall format which many of you custom to hear and I found you did most of the interviews. You do mostly interviewing not interview so I decided you did interview me today. Okay. I was born in Atlanta. Are you going to be disappointed if this really happens? No, Eli is not. He's smiling. They were the headphones. He would really like it. I got a feeling I'm 99% right? So we'll just go back to what we were anticipated. I'm really happy our paths crossed today with 300 of our friends and the other agreement we had was it would be a conversation and it would be informal but we are here to inspire and form and to entertain a little bit because for the students in the room we realize it's the ninth week. Yes. So it's the people are in finals and but not right now. Okay. So I'm happy to try to be entertaining. So let's go back to your life. Where did you go to undergrad? I went to the University of Pennsylvania. What did you study? I had a dual degree between the undergraduate Wharton School and the Arts and Sciences. So yeah, I remember seeing this. BS and BSE. Yeah, that's economics. So the way that that works, everybody gets a BSE but then you have a concentration and mine was in finance. And then in Arts and Sciences I studied political science and I also took enough French to have a second major. Well, let's get a shout out to all of you. I was actually amortizing my college tuition dollars to the Nth degree. So I studied a lot. Well, so let me check in with who's here because we're a little unusual then coming to speak say at the business schools view from the top. So how many of you are engineering majors? Okay. How many are you in the business and law schools? We always have a few. Welcome. How about Arts and Humanities and Social Sciences? All right, welcome. Welcome. So it's a good mix. How many undergraduates? I love it. Again, at the graduate level. So it's split and then we have others that we're welcome. But everyone here is interested in entrepreneurship. How many people are interested in entrepreneurship? And innovation. How about entrepreneurship and innovation for some big, hairy problems the world are facing? Yeah. So this is what this is going to be about. So I want to get to that though, but I just I do want a little bit of your journey. So you go to Penn and something happened between there and here. So you went to you went to the business school here. I did. I did. Why did you get an MBA? Because this comes up a lot in our office hours, you know. I you know what I after undergraduate I worked at Goldman Sachs and sales and trading. And after almost four years I took my last bonus and paid off my undergraduate student debt and moved to Italy and read a lot of books that I didn't have a chance to read in those four years. And I thought I really wanted I wanted a little bit more schooling, but I really wanted to understand what it was like to be an entrepreneur. And so I applied to Stanford. Samford was the only graduate school I applied to. So one of your classmates are here. She runs, she's our counterpart over at the business school. I don't know if Lee is here, but it was kind of cool. She was your class. There you are. Hi, she is a director of the Center for Entrepreneurial Studies there. So which we're really close to. So it's that's a nice connection. Yeah. I mean, lobe behold, I forgot to mention she's a member of the Board of Trustees at this university, which is pretty cool. Yes. And I'm lucky to say my brother is. So you guys are on that board. I want to just check him out. What does the Board of Trustees do? You work really hard, but what is the role here? Well, it's a true governance board. So we have governance oversight over the university and the medical center, both. So it's an enormous enterprise. And truly, it requires a lot of work because it's a very complex enterprise to wrap your head around. So I think basically I'm your boss. You're Lee is boss too, then. And team is. Oh boy. Yeah, I'm just kidding. We're actually not really anybody's boss. But. I'm going to work late tonight to 530. I just want that noted. That will come out for the Board of Trustees. And okay, so let's speak in a watchmaner. You started something. Let's get at it. It called College Track about 20 years ago. I get that right. You and Carlos. Carlos and I first volunteered at Carmont High School almost 20 years ago. And then College Track was formed about 17 years ago. Okay. Yes. So I want to run a clip. I don't know if this is the right way to do it. Or you want to set up the clip? Yeah. Yeah. At the time though, 20 years ago actually had started a company out of business school. I did indeed start a company in 91 after I graduated. And I ran that until 96-ish. But in 95, Carlos and I went to Carmont High School for what we thought was going to be a one day visit to a school and it ended up changing both of our lives. So let's see how. I have friends that's the best. You see, I'm going to jump out there in high school. Why would you want to jump out when you can make your life so much better? My parents actually didn't go to college. They dropped out about a month or two school to go help support the family. So they didn't know nothing about higher education. Yeah, I went to College Track. I started in my freshman year. So I think that was like 98. My name is Marlene Castro. I am a College Track alumni from the East Pawel Auto site. I am now an Oakland teacher fighting for my students. There's always hope, especially for someone that is trying to mix up them themselves. My little brother wants to go to Stanford and for those things to happen, they need to have that support and to have people that believe when we surround the box. This whole college track atmosphere in order for them to get there. The main thing is that I feel like it's going to happen once again. I have a 14 year-old McAllister track. I set an example for him. So he wants to go to college and his support. My name is Chang Wailing-A. And I am a second year UC Berkeley. I utilize College Track a whole lot still because the resources are for me to use. From middle school, all the way to my graduate college. College was not even something I actually had in mind. But before I moved to New Orleans, I didn't even think I was kind of out of college. I was the guinea pig for our family in a sense of how to get through high school and how to apply to college so that my younger brother and now my younger cousins can also go through it with my support. Somewhere deep inside you is somebody that wants to succeed. That somebody that wants to become more than what they are right now. So this program isn't just here to help. The smarter kids, I just think it's smarter. It's to help the kids that are falling behind so they can get better. I want to go around telling people we can do anything that we set our minds to. Even if it's in the little crowd and I'm always speaking to one person. That one person can pass on to other people. I want the next generation to see us as the role model. Because the role model that I had going up pushed me forward were strong role models. So if I'm a strong role model, I mean the next generation gets a strong role model. And there comes an even stronger generation, even stronger generation. So it will become a generation that changes the world with everything that we do. When I first started College Track, my GPA was 2.0. But Gianna and a lot of College Track people, they gave me support. They gave me the resources that I need to succeed. And my grades improved by a lot. So my last GPA in high school was a 4.8. And without that, I'd be struggling so, so much right now. You don't even know how much these people have helped me. College Track is like my family with my blood. I bleed College Track. I think College Track has changed my life. I think it has made me get out there and talk to people and tell them, yes, I'm chicken. And yes, I don't come from one of the best communities or whatever you want to say. But that doesn't mean I'm not going to call College. That doesn't mean I'm not going to get it's Harvard. That doesn't mean I'm not going to become a lawyer. Maybe in the present. That's what it means. College Track gives us ideas to do those things. I want to make a difference and impact my community by becoming a lawyer. And just showing that we're here and that we have our own perspectives and that we can bring a lot to this country and make a difference. I literally feel like College Track is, was at that time and still continues to be a lifeline for how I am able to just continue to find success and be able to define that for people still in my community. I'm not just some of the kids trying to go to college. I want to be somebody. I want, I want, I want to be somebody that people like Ann was like, I want to be like him. I realize that I can be that person. Without College Track, I just would not be here today. Does anybody have any ghost bumps? I want to be somebody. I know. I want to be somebody. Who is that? Beautiful. Which fellow is that? He's a student from New Orleans College Track. Yeah. He's at Dillard University right now. So wow, we could go in a few directions here. So what does this have to do with entrepreneurship and innovation? Connect those dots. Well, it's social entrepreneurship. And it's innovating around a system that's rather intractable and finding those points where where you can come in with creativity and thought leadership and change things up. In this case, change things up for people's lives and be that inflection point that that a rather calcified system doesn't allow for typically. So I started in for-profit entrepreneurship. But when Carlos and I went and spoke to that classroom at Chrome on high school, we met students like the students who were in that video. And in fact, exactly one of them indeed, who became in our first class of College Track, what we found was, though, we found such a failed system. But it needed kind of an exogenous shock. It needed the type of entrepreneurship and problem solving that I was doing in the for-profit space that I thought, what a higher and better use of my life to do it in the social sector. But you brought an intensity and a flare to it that we typically see it in tech, but then it bring in just the whole style about, just the style of that. I mean, there's a bit of theater in that because I teared up the other day like I was at watching that, just like I was watching a, you know, a denominated for the Academy Awards. So with that, you think you're able to buy empathy. Well, change requires movement and movement requires communications and marketing. And so that's what you're seeing. And it happens to also be the truth and it happens to be deeply powerful because it's people's authentic words, but it's nevertheless a type of marketing. The other thing struck me, and as is the engineer and me, you know, it's data. I mean, if you go to CollegeTrack.org or whatever, if you go to the homepage, you see that and that grabs your heart. But then, you know, I'm satisfied as the engineer below is you set metrics. I mean, you set measurable goals. And there were, they, some showed up, you actually are over 2000 already, I think, right? Well on the way to. Oh, yes. This year, we're serving 2000 students, but we have over 200 college graduates who've gone through the entire program. We started off with a high school program that was all about sincere college readiness, but what we discovered is when students are first in their families to go to college, they actually need support all the way through to complete college. So then we extended the program to 10 years, so we gave students six years to come to college. Got it. Well, I just like the attention to data and read that into this. Well, there's no way to know if you're actually reaching your goals and affecting the change if you don't collect data. So you have to be data driven. The same principles apply in the nonprofit spaces they do in the for-profit space. That's such, that's a really important comment. Can you expand on that a little bit? Because we get asked this a lot. The name of our center is the Stanford Technology Ventures program and they say, well, that means you don't do social entrepreneurship. And so I help this on this. Well, I think that philanthropy and nonprofit space used to be sort of characterized as a softer space, but actually that's not the case at all. With the advent of venture philanthropy and impact philanthropy, people are really looking to the space to affect change. And people go, I think everyone in their lives, if they have a notion and a philosophy of what they want to do with their time on the planet, they want to have impact and affect change. And the only way you can do that is through metrics and goals and then strategies and tactics. It's the exact same way that you accomplish anything in either space. Well, today we're going to focus on education and immigration. We're going to build it that. But there's another way that we get to hang out on occasion is conservation international. I just want to digress for a minute. That is a large NGO in the environmental space and they're very much science driven, data driven. And that's what attracted me to. I don't know why you're on their board as well. And I don't know why you chose that of all the things you could do. But certainly was the science that attracted me. And I agree with you. I mean, their science is impeccable, but their leadership is equally impeccable. And I think that Peter Seligman's one of the great entrepreneurs in the world. And he happens, I think, to the good fortune of all of us to be in the social sector and trying to really move the needle in the environment. And the environment area. Well, we're going to go after two of us. We're going to climb a couple of other hills. And we started on that climb by noting, I call it track, and it continues to be, it continues to scale. As somebody put it, as we were getting prepped to this, one of your team members said that it was a bit of the DNA of what turned into Emerson Collective, which has been your system, your set of processes here in this decade. So can we talk about that? So what is Emerson Collective's involvement in education? Well, College Track indeed informed and continues to inform me and my work practice because I get to work with students day in, day out, really hear from them and be responsive to them. I think it would be a big mistake to move away from that direct service that grassroots impact and information that that we get. And what age groups is that? Is that K through 12 or is 10 to the high school? Well, so Emerson is mainly focused on high school, though what we see is obviously you can't focus on one part of the system. So we've expanded our desire to change the entire system, looking at all inputs into both the system and what comprises the ecosystem of the public education in America. So what I mean by that is our system is broken. If any students here who have gone through the public education system know as the promise of the great equalizer and the prepare of our citizenry, it is the way that we are. It is unfortunately failing because students continue to drop out their deep inequities in the public education system, their deep inequities in teaching and learning and it's based on a notion of time because it was started a hundred years ago during the industrial age when time as a unit of measurement was very efficient. And so people serve the same amount of time in the system but their learning is variable. We think that should be flipped. We think the learning should be at the high standard and the time on task should be variable. So that requires system change. So how do you do about that? It will. Well. What are some examples? Well we have a portfolio of organizations that we support in the for-profit sector, in the non-profit sector and then we have our own initiatives that we have taken on. So let's do ed tech because we had one of the leaders of the new school ventures, venture fund which you are actually on that board. I don't know when you get to. No, I'm all over on forebored. Well okay. You're just making all of them. She spoke in this series and talked to a good about it. I think it must have been last spring if I got that right. We took you through sort of the burgeoning ed tech sector. Yeah. It's good. It's open. Yeah. It's starting to break wide open. It's actually really exciting. So which we know about that because I think it was for those who were here at that or want to know more because we got a lot of engineering. I think what's really exciting is that it's become a viable market. You're seeing a lot of for-profit entrepreneurs enter the space. You saw a lot of non-for-profit entrepreneurs first enter the space like Wendy Cobb 25 years ago starting to teach for America and then the 35,000 people that have gone through that have many of them have stayed. Most of them have stayed in the ed sector and they started new schools and they started new companies and they run districts and so they have a whole different change mentality. But also what's breaking wide open is the role of technology in teaching and learning has become an incredibly valuable tool and of course actually education is big business. So over a trillion dollars is spent in education each year in the United States and so some of the monopolies that were held by say the textbook industry are starting to crack open. I think also the consumers are becoming far more savvy about learning through technology and so having technology enable teaching and learning and they're willing to pay for it. So it's an exciting time. I think we're going to see massive changes because of that. And I'm thinking of a piece I saw that was sent over that you had five priorities that was one of them and that obviously caught my eye. Yeah but the way that Emerson collective works not to get too wonky in here but we're rather agnostic about the way that our capital is deployed. So we work in the C3 space which is the nonprofit space and support and we're really attracted to break through entrepreneurs there. We work in the C4 space which is issue advocacy so people who are doing grassroots organizing and issue advocacy in states and at the federal level we support. We support because schools and actually education is political. We spend political dollars based on people who we believe are trying to do the right thing for kids and then we have for profit investing. So we're really fortunate to actually have all sorts of important things. And then on the political side is it local or national or both? Yeah all of them because the governance unit for schools is the school board. And so you have to look at the municipalities, the district level, the state level and the federal level. Okay so where are you feeling like you're making progress and where you're frustrated? Because I know you're going to push boundaries so just pretend like we're sitting here just not listening. Well I feel like this is my life's work. So if I were frustrated now that would be really sad for me. So I'm extremely hopeful but hope plus work is what affects change. And so we have deeply intellectual work and technical work and organizational work in addition to hope in the resiliency of humankind. And you can see when we get to work with students and we visit schools all the time we visit failing schools and we visit extraordinary schools both. So whenever I travel I want to visit one of each or if I don't have time for two. I want to see the schools that are actually failing the students so that it recommits me to do this work on behalf of as many kids as I can help. Well again in getting prep for this I had an epiphany. It looks I think you're in a really rather unique position because you understand all those angles or quadrants. In other words you understand the nonprofit world, the policy world, you understand the startup and technology world. I mean you really get all of it in your gut and you can get in there because otherwise you want to talk about rhetoric. We're going to get to rhetoric in a moment in partisanship with the immigration staff. But in education there's a good bit of that too. Right you got well are you with the unions or not like the last election here in California for the state superintendent of schools. I mean that got really nasty. Yes. It was funny. I mean it was my frustration. We were talking about education but these ads were just intense. No well for some people the stakes are very high and when you're part of the status quo and you're protecting your power base you're going to fight for it. So that's understandable. It's also understandable that if people are not satisfied with what's happening in our country and with our output they should fight for change too. And so on the other hand what often gets lost in the mix is the voice of students. And so at Emerson we always like bringing it back to the voice of students really to Asamio. Is this working for you and parents? Is this working for you? And if the answer is no then actually the zero sum and politicking that goes on and the discussions that are only about what's good for adults is not acceptable. So that's completely compatible with what we teach in our courses regarding entrepreneurship in terms of if we're talking about for profit customer development. Go get out of the building as they say and go talk to customers. And the D school they talk about needs finding. I mean it is completely compatible with what we're trying to do. Usually using the cases being a tech, a piece of technology but it applies. Yeah, it does. It's one-on-one. It does. All right well let's go to the rhetoric. Yes and we'll have time for questions afterwards. Yeah so we can come back around the education. Yeah I'll play in time. I know but it's such a layered and complex issue and deeply fascinating I think and so it requires layered and complex solutions. Education. Yeah. But let's talk about immigration. Sure. Because that's you know the- It's topical, it's relevant, it's central to our country. Well like topical today's news. I mean yeah. And the United States because we have a global audience. The United States, the funding of the Department of Homeland Security was held up over the last week over this particular item. About the President. Why does it get so emotional? Well I mean you could do it. You know if you look at immigration historically as an issue. I don't think there's ever been a time when a group has been led in that they don't want to close the door behind them. And that's just how our country has evolved. And there's always been a time where a group of individuals has been scapegoated and vilified and then finally assimilated and then they become Americans. On the other hand there's never been a time when our economic engine hasn't been fueled by new immigrants to our country. Because our replenishing is our refueling. It's essential for the continuation and the continued economic growth for our country. We know this. However, when people are suffering they like scapegoating others. And there are some people who are serving in the United States Congress who are completely rigid and there are few who have a big megaphone who are hate mongering and it's to the detriment of all of us. We have had across our country a desire for immigration reform for years. And it bloated across the United States. And so at Emerson another tool that we use is we do a lot of national and local polling. And so in this case we did a lot of polling in districts, in communities, in states, nationally. So that we were informed again, we gathered data, we listened to people, we did focus groups, I attended focus groups in Arizona and Texas and Ohio and Virginia and no matter what the majority of the people and most of them were Republican audiences, the majority of them wanted common sense immigration reform. In fact we have a super majority of Americans who want this. It's not happening right now, we do not have a representative democracy around this issue and that needs to change. And so we ask ourselves, well given this set of information, how do we actually affect change? How do we try to raise the consciousness, raise the awareness, bring this to the fore so that constituents actually speak out to the representatives and say in this case, because federal policy is the end goal, there's not a lot of mitigation between what we can do as citizens and what the federal policy can do for them. So we can start demanding that their votes reflect our wishes. So perhaps I should just back up. The reason Emerson collects is that, yes, let me connect those dots for you. So because college track does inform so much of our work, in 2001 when our first group of students were applying to college, we found that there was a significant percentage of students who were undocumented. They found out at the same time we found out because they didn't have a social security number and they couldn't apply to college. They couldn't fill out the FAFSA forms and they didn't qualify for state and federal loans or any kind of funding or grant for their education. And so we had made both an explicit and implicit promise to our students that if they followed all these steps, we put together a very robust and demanding program that we would help them get through college. So we had to fulfill our promise, but I started to understand the purgatory that undocumented people lived in in this country and in the summer with no-nice families. And then in 2006, then President Bush was very committed to immigration reform and he unfortunately didn't bring that to pass. We thought that was going to pass. And then we had an opportunity when we had both houses of Congress and the presidency, all Democrats who said they wanted immigration reform. They didn't bring it up to passage so they didn't complete it. And it just became the most shocking, intractable problem. We had students that are continuing now. I mean, this is an issue that people have started to be aware of for over a decade and nothing has changed. And meanwhile, we now know, we all know. We have 11 million people who are living in this purgatory. We have, I mean, the conservative estimates are that the boost to our economy would be $600 billion over an eight-year period and probably quite a bit higher. Every year we have 650,000 students who graduate from high school in the U.S. who are undocumented. And all and their only option up until the executive action was to work in the cash industry. Can we play the video now? Yes, so yes. So the video that Dr. Barz is talking about is, are you a doctor? I have a PhD, but I'm not that kind of doctor. So you can call me doctor. But let's do a face on this. So what we decided to do was we thought our contribution, in this case, could be marketing and raising awareness. And so we produced a documentary and we built out a website and we kind of knitted together the activist communities. And then I'll tell you what we ended up doing with the film. We hired Davis Guggenheim, who's a great documentary filmmaker, and he made a 30-minute film for us that was screened very, very widely. Oh, you did? Yeah. So cool. Yeah. It's bigger than a website. Beeper than a documentary. More powerful than a petition. It's a story about people. Instead of calling them illegals, let's call them occupiers or trespassers or invaders or squatters. Same day that I graduated, I checked my mouth and I had gotten a full scholarship. I get a call from the admissions office. We're really sorry, but you can't get your scholarships anymore. I have a degree of health. What am I doing? You can dream what you want. Why are you still here? The Dream Act is legislation that says if you came to the US as a child, we will give you a chance to be legal in America. Growing up, I always say I want to be in a military. He's the kind of guy that our military needs. I always say, imagine what it would feel like to be told, you know, congratulations. This is my assume of commodity, but I could be deported in this ring. Am I going to be able to finish the semester? You know what? It's real. I can't even drive a license, I can't have a state ID. I qualify for everything. I just can't fill in that space for a social security. I want to graduate. I want to go to college. I want to be a doctor. We, the people, said believe the phrase was no way Josef. They're not going to listen to us. We're not going to be able to do that. That's a life thing. This is going to be fun. This really is the future of our country. Yeah, I'm going to be in the end right now. This is more than a movie. It's a movement. Upload your photograph. Put a human face to the petition. The time is right. The choice is real. The dream is now. The movie set. We set the timeline for this. 2013. We made that. 2013. That's a full movie. It's 30 minutes. It's 30 minutes. Yeah. It is a full movie. We screened it in the US Capitol. In fact, that was our premiere screening. And we had all the students that are profiled in the film and their families there. And a number of congresspeople came. And then we screened it for the some of members of the Republican caucus, the Democratic caucus, and the House of Representatives. And then we've screened it on MSNBC. It's on Netflix. iTunes. Over 100. We put together at college campus screening movement. We screened it on over 100 colleges as well. And a lot of the students who are profiled in the film helped to manage all of the activism and the screenings and they smoke it most of them. We also want some photos that was from another camera. Yeah. Part of what you're showing is different ways. I think it kind of stretches the definition of an entrepreneur. I feel like an entrepreneur is nimble and creative and still very goal oriented. And tenacious. Because you have to be. Yeah. And I think you tried to do more than you think is possible with less than two years. Do you think this is entrepreneur? Absolutely. I think it's directly connected to it. Because there's a lot ahead with it. There's a lot of forces. I mean, this is. Yeah. You know, you know, swimming, whatever metaphor is swimming gets the tide. Yeah. Because it is it is a grind. So something else that we did as we were pushing for this to happen is we wanted to we want to have community engagement. Because all change is sustained by communities. And so we partnered with the photographer J.R. And we went we fitted out kind of retrofitted these FedEx buses or vans and made them into mobile photo booths. And people would show up at the cities. We went to 19 cities around the U.S. And have their portraits taken and their giant their life size portraits that get printed out. And in each city where where we went, we stayed for several days and we used a lot of social media. And we would paste up iconic structures and buildings. And so there are a couple of things. Let's see a couple of you. Can you do a chance that this is quite remarkable? Oh, that's that's that's. Whoops. Yeah. So that's the Selma bridge. Oh, and those are all portraits of yeah individuals in there on the bridge holding it. Wow. And then the next one Chad, let's have a look at this for a while. That's a college campus plaza. I think it's UNC. And just cost the plaza. Yeah, it was gigantic that pasting. Well, and I think there's one more. That is so so that's kind of well it's a little hard to see here. I don't know if you all can see it there. At the end of our campaign, this is in front of the Capitol on the Capitol lawn. And we had gigantic portraits of four individuals. One is a dreamer. One is an entrepreneur. He might have, I think he spoke in your class. Or maybe is Patrick Callis. Yeah, Patrick, right. Which John was in two weeks ago. They're all immigrants. And then two others, I can't tell who they are, Stacey could tell. And there's sort of different faces, different profiles of immigrants in the United States. And so you could see this right outside of Speaker Bainer's office, which was right there. We did get in a little bit of trouble for killing the grass. So we had to replant it. And then we wrote up this manifesto. And this is an ad that we took out in the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post. So we use all different types of media. So what's next? Oh, and there's one more. Oh, one more. We eat you. Yeah, let's talk about everything. Yeah, you want to do that? Or then talk about what's next. So this is a truly, I'd like this story. Yeah. So this is a picture of Jose who was profiled in the Dreamers Now movie. I think you saw him briefly. He was showing his diploma from ASU. He's a mechanical engineer. And he was doing construction work. But with the president's executive action in 2012, no, 2013. No, 2012 executive action. The parent is now. Oh, now that was the original doc. The original doc is 2012 and that was a two year program. He ended up getting, doc stands for deferred action for childhood arrivals. So for the Dreamers who we were advocating for, many of them qualified to live free from fear of deportation under this. But it was only, it was, it's a temporary program. And his renewal of DACA and what's called DACA, which is deferred action for, for parents arrivals, is what the Republican House of Representatives was trying to hold up in the DHS funding. But Jose ended up getting DACA status, which means he could get a work permit. And he was hired by Teach for America in Arizona. And this is him in his classroom this year in September. I mean, because when he first got out with his mechanical engineering degree, he was not allowed to work in that profession. It was just go out and be a daily. No, no, no, no, you get that wrong. You're exactly right. Of course, you couldn't get a work permit. Yeah, so that's what he did. It was just a daily construction. Fine line between, you know, those of us sitting in the room and that. Yeah. Really fine line. No, that it's, it's all of our story. So. Do you want to take questions? I think we better, because I've run out. Much. I don't think anyone believes that. Okay, let's have some hands. How about right here? We'll speak. We'll speak up. All right, thanks. So really inspiring stories with all these kids. My wife and I run a small nonprofit that's a horsemanship program. We teach a lot of younger kids. And one of the things we see that really makes a difference, particularly with the kids with special needs, is that they're so often told. So often told what they can't do. And in my experience, teaching at a computer clubhouse for kids with farm worker kids. Similar kind of problem to all. They don't expect the colleges for them. That's for other people. Do you see, how do you see that playing out? And do you have any stories of some of these kids changing how they think about themselves? Yes, we have a, we have many stories with college track students. Over 90% of college track students are first in family to. Access any higher education. And so 96% are first in family to go to a four year college. And because you don't have that tradition in your family or in your community. If you don't get it from your school, you're not the encouragement, the high expectations. That role modeling that you see yourself in, you're not going to get it. And so we have to, we have to make this change. Student by student, classroom by classroom, family by family, school by school. And that whole culture and mindset is right at the core of the change that needs to happen. Let me see if I can do it. I want to see, get a student far back right there. Yeah, that's you. Hello. Thank you so much for the job. So we've already established a work that we're doing is on the community nature. And as every speaker before you are spoken, that's really hard. Gorgon requires a lot of sacrifices. And in part, that's at least, to some extent compensated by financial incentive. The fact that you might make big and have a lot of financial pay-off. But the kind of work you're doing does not have that at all. As a nonprofit, you're not able to make that set up money. So how do you fit this into a picture? How can we change so that more people actually can make that decision of working really hard? It's a really hard work that may not be open for money. You know what? Social entrepreneurs generally don't make a lot of money. It's true. They just don't. There are intrinsic rewards that are off the charts. The extrinsic rewards are limited. I think, you know, what I'm seeing in this sector though is a very, very healthy living. But you're never going to get the kind of breakthrough and wild upside that you see in the for-profit sector. And so you have to reconcile yourself to that and be willing to make a fine living, but maybe not have the kind of wild financial success that you can have in the for-profit sector. Now, that's one that's one that's actually reality, right? But then what if we thought, okay, what if we really wanted to incent the best and the brightest to go into the social sector to affect the kind of change that is required there? How could we think about this differently? What if we had a startup fund that social entrepreneurs got shares in that say all the VCs in Silicon Valley contributed to? What if some established companies put aside some sort of bonuses for people who have breakthrough change ideas or who are equipping communities to be agents of their own change? I mean, there are a lot of different ways we as a society can start just changing up the financial rewards so that it can become a much more exciting from a financial point of view, exciting career path than it currently is. To me, there's no work like this. There's no work that gives me the level of reward that one gets when you see the students who you saw in the college track video, students who finally understand they can do anything they want with their lives. That's a tremendous payout. But financially, I think we need to reorient as a society a little bit so that there's more of an alignment. Well said, right here. This is more about your career. You as a woman, have you ever faced any limits or any barriers in society when you entered the role of finances or how do you achieve them, how do you jump like from them? Well, when I first started out on the sales and trading floor and fixed income at Goldman Sachs, there were 10% women on that trading floor. Now I was lucky because I grew up with three brothers so I was used to just being surrounded by men and boys. So it wasn't all that different from my kitchen table when I grew up. But there were plenty, I mean, it was not for the faint of heart. It was not for the thin skin to be on a trading floor. There were plenty of times when there were terrible things said to me about all sorts of things. You know, I've been out of that industry for a long, long time. I think the world has changed a lot. I think there's a lot more acknowledgement and sensitivity. Probably there's still a lot of Mottismo on a trading floor. I haven't been on one lately. But I think, you know, there are other compensations. If you go into whatever career path you take, you can actually not be surprised. You can actually kind of try things out. You can shadow people. You can get a sense of the culture in different sectors and industries and you have to see where you feel most comfortable. How about right here? Hi. My name is Emerson. I'm actually an editor. I'm actually an editor. I'm an immigrant in Navisa. I love what you're doing. Oh, right. I have to ask you. I have to ask you. I have to ask you. Thank you. I think that's a hard application. Of course, we all know that it's broken. You mentioned it. And I know that academia hasn't changed in a while and it probably won't. So what is something that we can do as editor contributors? We'd add a full support of academia that can actually move the needle and really support students. In higher ed? You're asking about higher ed? Yeah, because I'm in page 12 right now because the teachers are younger. They're starting to adopt a lot easier than higher education. So, yeah, that's an interesting point of view. And Emerson, we just met with Carl Wyman, who many of you may know. He's a joint professor at the Ed School and in the physics department. And he's here at Stanford and he is a treasurer. He's a Nobel Prize-winning physicist. But he's so deeply committed to changing up how big lectures are taught in science and how science is taught in higher ed. There's a lot of work going on here. He's working with the faculty and so you should go meet with him right away. He's really interesting. I think also your dean. The dean of engineering is incredibly creative and innovative and is really looking for ways to change up how education happens in the business. This is where you ask me about epicenter though. Also, I believe you have a program called epicenter. Thank you. Thank you. So, come see me or anybody across the hall where we're working on changing faculty and students in colleges. So, everybody gets to learn about entrepreneurship and innovation. And we're doing that in a systemic way. Thanks. Team me up on that. I'm happy to give you a lot. Okay. Right here, another student. How did you decide to focus your project in this specific part of the population? Why did you decide to work in improving the education and with this specific part, or if it's instead of focusing on any other thing? Well, the genesis of my awareness and awakening came just from visiting a classroom in a local high school by chance. I went a friend of mine and I were asked to go and speak to a high school. This was 20 years ago to a class. And these were a class of students from East Palo Alto, which is right next door to us. And they were seniors in high school who had been told that they were in a college prep course. And the teacher had asked us to speak to them about college in general. And the teacher had explained to us that at this high school, Carman High School at the time, there were 1700 students and there was one college counselor. She said, unfortunately no one in my class has gotten to see a college counselor yet. So we'd like you to come and speak about college. And so we said we'd be delighted and we came in and what we found very quickly was that of the 35 students in the class, three as seniors, three had taken the required courses to even apply to a four-year school. So 32 couldn't even apply. And when I found that out, I decided that this was such an abomination and such an injustice. And it was happening right in my backyard that I could do nothing but devote my life to trying to understand why this happened and what I could do to change it. So all your inspiration for the project was because of that visit? It really was. It really was. I guess sometimes in life you can really pinpoint the moment when things change for you. That's a great question. We like asking that if people, Tina taught me this question, three words, what motivates you? And I meant to ask you that question. It both segments of our discussion, the one about education and the one about immigration. So I'm going to take the last question. So it's not that one. Thank you for helping me remember that. This is dial back time. You're at Penn. You're 20 years old. What would you tell yourself? Oh. Right now. Yeah, you're out here. You're back in Penn. You're sitting in some lecture. I would tell myself to have faith. I think I was, you know, I was a middle class kid. I went to a high school that did not adequately prepare me for college. I worked really, really hard academically. And I also had a work study job and I had a job outside of work study. And I was not relaxed. I had a lot of student debt. I was financially independent. I had a lot of pressure. And I think I didn't allow myself to think expansively about my life because there were exigencies that needed to be attended to. But I always had sort of big dreams. You know, I was always so intrigued and enchanted by social movements. I didn't think that I could do that because back to the first students question, I actually financially I really needed to figure things out. And I think I would tell myself to relax. And the time would come because if I stayed true to myself, the way that life evolves, you end up getting to do what you think is your highest invest use. Did you have a good time? I mean now? Yeah. All right, did you have a good time? Thank you so much. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. you
