 You were listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at edcorner.stanford.edu. Today we have a fabulous honor of having one of my favorite entrepreneurs in the valley here. I think you will be as just as impressed as I am. Mir Imran is one of the most remarkable people I have ever met. He, like many of you, has a background in engineering. He was an electrical engineer by training and then went and did a degree in biomedical engineering. He then, a few years later, started a company called Incubed Laboratories with the idea that he wanted to create a place to develop lots of new medical technologies. Over the last years, he has started 20 different companies and has over 200 patents in his name. So I am going to get a chance to interview Mir today and I want to invite him up to the front of the room. Great. So, Mir, welcome back to campus. Thank you. Great. So I will tell you, a lot of people are very proud of themselves when they are in serial entrepreneur, but you have taken it well beyond that. You are a parallel entrepreneur. You have many different features going on at once. What does that mean and what is that all about? You know, I didn't coin that terms. One of the people who had interviewed me a few years back coin that after looking at what I do. And parallel entrepreneurship is, you know, just, I work on many, many different problems and companies at the same time. And as a result, I go crazy. It's actually a very nutty thing to do and I don't recommend it. Yeah, you don't recommend it. You look very common, relax to me. I mean, how many different projects do you have going on at any one time? You know, I sort of divide them in two groups. One is the active companies. So I currently have about eight companies. But eight companies? Are they all under the same roof at NQ? No, no, no. Some of them have graduated and left. Okay. About half of them have left and half of them are still there. And I probably have about a dozen projects, research projects at any given time. Now most of them don't make it. So maybe you could describe the pipeline. Things go from obviously an idea to something that becomes a research project and then maybe it turns into a venture. Maybe you could explain the process. So you know, most of you can imagine it starts with the problem. The process is really, it begins with the analysis of the problem looking at the attributes of the problem. And when I say attributes, you look at how big is the problem. And how is that problem currently solved? Are there opportunities to improve that solution? Or sometimes you stumble on problems that haven't been solved. So you spend a lot of time understanding the problem. And you know, probably during this first concept stage, 80, 90% of my time goals in understanding the problem. So it's really, I feel that the more time you spend with the problem, the better. The better chance you have of coming up with a good solution. So I think just to give the audience a sense of the range of topics that you tackle. I mean, I think it's overwhelming. I can't even imagine that one person can be a master of all these different fields. Maybe you could give us a sampling of some of the projects you have going on right now. Well, probably about half of them are implantable devices. These are, there's one company developing a gastric pacemaker for the treatment of obesity. Another one is focused on treatment of chronic pain with an implantable stimulator. And another one is developing an implantable device for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Another one which is very exciting company where we're applying, it's a drug device combination for the treatment of epilepsy. So it's an exciting novel approach. And I collaborated on that project with some scientists at Duke. And there are a couple others. The artificial colon and rectum, you know, prosthetic colon and rectum company for people who have colostomies due to cancer or what have you. So we could potentially restore normal function. And then another one which is focused on inflammatory bowel disease. So a whole range of things. How do you become so well versed in all of these different fields? You know, I am actually not. What happens is I look at a problem. You know, for instance, take any one of these things, epilepsy. And when you look at epilepsy and you look at the drugs that are out there and the device therapies that are out of the deep brain stimulation, you find that the success is really low. I mean, the best therapies there have success rates that are amazingly low, both drugs and devices. So I see that as an opportunity. So I go into that area really not understanding it that well. I mean, I went to medical school. So I have reasonable understanding, but I don't have current understanding. So I do a lot of literature search. And you know, the way most of you would start digging up a problem. I look at what is currently being done, what are the side effects of those therapies. And then I dig deeper. I go into the cellular level. What is happening at the cellular level? Do we understand the problem well enough? And sometimes I end up coming up with a solution, not always. So what do you consider a good exit strategy for these ventures? They usually get acquired. Do they go public? What is it happening? You know, if you look at my companies, I probably have sold nine companies and an additional three have gone public. But even the ones that went public were ultimately acquired. And then out of the eight that are currently there, this one getting ready to go public shortly. So it's a mixed bag. You know, depends on the kind of technology. But you know, it's very difficult for any of these companies to survive long term on their own because they're a single product company. So the risks are very high for these companies. You know, one hiccup and you're in deep trouble. So, you know, manufacturing problem, clinical problem, regulatory problem, any delays can basically shut you down. So that's why most of these companies end up getting sold to bigger companies. Why do you set them up as individual companies, as opposed to having one big company with all of these different product lines? You know, one of the reasons startups are successful is because you have a single-minded focus on one problem. And so if you have, you know, four problems or five problems under one roof with an R&D team, first of all investors, you can't attract investors. They're attracted to a specific problem. And secondly, you can't focus. You know, and one project can steal all the resources if it's going well. Or one project that's not going well can drag the whole thing down. So it's better to separate them early. And I only allow myself to be, you know, distracted and unfocused. And focus. You're the one who gets to be distracted and unfocused, but all the teams are essentially are very focused on their project. Now where are these ideas come from? Do they all just pop out of your brain? And you, you know, sort of wake up in the morning and say, we've got to solve this epilepsy problem. Or, you know, we've got to figure out how to deal with obesity. Or do people come to you with their ideas? I think it's a little bit of both more, most of these companies are my ideas, most of the technology. A couple of occasions I've collaborated on the epilepsy company, on the pain company. So you know, but I'm not averse to working with other scientists and entrepreneurs. I just have had my plate full with my own ideas. So I haven't actively gone out and recruited more and more things. That's right. You're not at a loss for ideas. Yeah. You know, I think ideas are so easy to come up with. They're the easiest thing. It's the implementation and, you know, it's a long road. Whenever you launch a company, it's a six, seven year journey. If you're successful. And so I spend a lot of time early and I'm willing to kill these ideas if they don't meet the criteria. So why don't you tell us a little story? I want to hear about at least the process that typically happens and maybe the timeframe for one of these ideas. Let's take one that's a success. You know, my idea to actually some exit and the hurdles along the way. Yeah. So, you know, these ideas come sort of in random, multiple ways. So in back in 1992, a friend of mine had a carotid and adrectomy, which is cleaning up of carotid arteries and ended up with a stroke. And he had then a few months later the second carotid artery cleaned and he had another stroke. And I started scratching my head and I said, you know, these are symbolic events and they should be a way to fix that or prevent that from happening. And then I was busy with a couple other companies. So I just, it was in the back of my mind. And then another year later, another acquaintance of mine had a saffonous vein graft, angioplasty and ended up dying because of a huge amount of symbolic load flowing downstream into the heart. So that really was the beginning of the concept. So I said, this is a problem that's worth fixing. So I went to some of my friends who were interventional cardiologists, folks here and at other institutions. And I said, you know, is this a problem in your practice and they said, no, you know, we never have symbolic events in our, when we're doing stenting or angioplasty. So I started looking at literature and what I found is sure enough in the US clinical literature you didn't, couldn't find back in the early 90s, couldn't find any papers talking about symbolic events and complications. But Europeans were writing about it because they're not worried about getting sued. So always when you're looking at some unique problems, look at European literature. Sometimes they're much more open about problems. So I decided to come up with some tools that prevent symbolic events during the procedure. He wasn't really upheld battle because when I went to talk to investors, they, in doing the diligence, they would call these same guys who said, this is not a problem. So I told them that this is what you're going to hear, but trust me, this is, you know, so it was, I think primarily because I had established a long track record. So the investor said, fine, you know, in the presence of clinical experts saying, no, we don't need it. I was able to raise four, five million dollars and launch the company. And as we started getting more, some clinical data publishing that data, there were 20 other symbolic prevention companies that came out because everybody saw how important this area was. And what we found out was in saffonous vein graph therapy or interventions, there was almost a 20% incidence of symbolic events. It was huge. And so we were able to do a randomized trial. Here's another interesting anecdote. We got FDA approval on a 510K. Most of you know what a 510K is. I think a lot of people won't know what that is. 510K is an easy way of getting, a faster way of getting FDA approval and it applies to those devices that have a precedent. So if you have a device that is similar to some other device and it is not going to cause any harm to the patient, you have to come up with justifications and FDA generally gives you a very quick approval. So we got that. But we realized that if we were to start selling the product with that approval, physicians were still of the mindset that you didn't need this, you know, that they were of the mindset that symbolic events were not a problem. So we went back to the FDA and said we would like to do a randomized trial under a PMA. PMA is the longer protracted thing and we wanted to establish scientifically in a randomized trial with statistical significance that we can reduce symbolic events and it does make a difference to the patients. And it took another $10 million and two more years to do 800 patients and that helped turn this approach into a standard of care. So physicians could no longer say we don't need it. So we ended up selling the company to metronome. So let me ask you a question. FDA approval. Is this a good thing or a bad thing? It's huge hurdle. Oh, it's essential. But once you get over it, does it give you a really long lead time against competitors? I mean, is this something that is a real wonderful benefit in the medical world or is it something? Oh, I think it's an essential thing, you know. It sort of forces us to really think through the impact, the safety issues for the patient. And in the consequences of not complying with regulations are really, really bad. So I mean, a lot of these regulations are good things. You're forced to document everything, follow procedure in your development, product development plan, and keep track of what you're shipping out traceability. So all these things are good and good practices. So I think it's essential. I was thinking about it from the business perspective that once you make it through, you've sort of left a lot of other people scrambling to catch up. That's such a big barrier to get over. Is that something that you view as an important competitive advantage? I think regulatory stuff is a competitive advantage, but you're not going to keep others away who are in the business because they understand the regulatory process as well as you do. But I think it's intellectual property that is the real barrier. And that's why we spend a lot of time. And I think most entrepreneurs look at intellectual property as an essential element in commercializing something. So you're talking about patents. Having protected patents. And so do you spend a significant amount of your resources in essentially protecting the inventions that you've been up with? Great. So now here was a, let's look at the flip side. That was a great story, a big success, and where you ended up even putting more hurdles in front of yourself in order to make sure that your product was really unique. What about some big failure? I know that you are unique in that huge percentage of things that you do are successful. But if you had some that have just bombed along the way, you go, well, gosh. Yeah. Would it not definitely? Actually, my success rate is high mainly because I'm willing to kill the projects before I launch a company. So if I count the projects I kill, the failures are many. But among the companies, I've lost two companies. One was a dot-com, which I started in the fall of 1999, which was bad timing. I should have stuck to medical devices. So that was, it lasted for all of— It lasted for about two, right? It lasted all of eight, nine months, and so that was a total waste of time. And then another company I had started back in 1995. And it was, as I was doing a lot of work with implantable devices, I realized that biomaterials were going to become very important for implantable, or even non-implantable devices, biomaterability is essential whenever you touch a patient. So I started a company to develop biomaterials, and my idea was I would license these to other MET tech companies for using their devices. And after a couple of years, I, more thinking about it, I had already started the company. I realized that it was not a good business model because you're selling this biomaterial, which is a small part of a product, perhaps. When you're trying to collect royalties, and those royalties won't come until that company is successful, that product is successful. So I decided to shut it down and fold it into my business incubator. So I'm still using those biomaterials in a number of my companies. But even though it was a failure, it wasn't a real failure. Right. The technology is really quite good. So do you have a formal process of evaluating things along the way? Do you wait for certain milestones or every day are you sort of taking the temperature of these ventures? You know, there is a, I realized after building several companies, and in some of these, I really went through a lot of headaches and challenges. There was one company I should never have started. But you know, I was ultimately able to make it successful, but it was a bad idea. So that was the one that really taught me the value of discipline and analysis upfront to evaluate your ideas and kill them because it's much more painful to kill a company or to fix a failing company than to kill a nation's idea where you haven't invested a lot of time and money in it. So you put a lot of upfront effort into evaluating whether it's highly likely that it's going to be successful first. Right. So, but there's not no guarantee of success. I mean, the big hurdles come once you actually start the project. Right. I'm always fascinated with entrepreneurship about the escalation of commitment along the way. And do you feel that at each one of these steps? Oh, yeah. You know, it's, I sometimes feel like I'm stuck in the twilight zone of the start-up. You know, it's a long, it's a marathon. You have to look at each problem, solve it, periodically step back and make sure you're going in the right direction. You have to surround yourself with really smart people, get smart money involved, hire people who are really committed and talented. I mean, it's all those elements. And sometimes, you know, a lot of times companies get into trouble because of people problems. Well, I was just going to ask you about that. Clearly you've got all of these ventures going. You need to have really amazing people for each one of them. Do you have a pool of people that you just keep kind of pulling in off the bench for each one of these new projects or do you restap each one very specifically? I think it's the latter. Occasionally, I have had several times people who have gone into one company and seven, eight years later, that company is sold and whatnot. They've come back and gone through another company. But most of the time, I put a team together for that project and it's, I tell you, that's the hardest thing to do. Is that the hardest part? What are you looking for when you're looking for people? Is it looking for pure technical skills? Are you looking for complementary skills? What are you looking for? Well, I first part the problem, the project. Generally, it's a development project and you parse it into its mechanical engineering, material, science, electron. If it has all those elements or in some cases, biology and chemistry, and you look at all these things and figure out what skillsets you need and try and find those. You cannot find the exact skillsets you're looking for. So what I usually do is I find somebody who's really good. I'll hire them and then modify my plan of hiring the other people. So it's a very dynamic process. And sometimes I find some really brilliant people and I say, boy, I really want to start a company around this person. Have you done that? I've done that once, actually. Yeah, so what tells the story? You found somebody and you said, this is like an amazing person. I'm going to bring them in and build a company around them. Right. So this guy, his name is Glen McLaughlin. He actually got his PhD at Stanford. But he started work for me in 1991. He had just graduated from Carnegie Mellon as undergrad. And he worked with me for five years and then left to get his PhD at Stanford. And while he was getting his PhD, he was the smartest guy I've ever worked with. You should get him here sometime, an amazing guy. So when he started his PhD here, I asked him to, I told him, you know, I'll give you a cubicle and a thousand dollars a month stipend, just hang out here because I'm always working on some problems and we can brainstorm occasionally. And he would do that and back in 2009 or 2000, I came up with an idea for a new ultrasound imaging system, a new way of doing ultrasound imaging. And I decided to form a company. And he was still finishing his PhD here and finished it. So I went ahead and started the company. It's called Sonari Medical Systems now. And within a few months, he joined a senior engineer. And I knew his potential. So I made him chief technical officer. And the product has done amazingly well in it. It has the company did 30 million in revenue last year. And it's getting ready to go public next year. So it's a, you know, he's one of those guys where I can get him. And I know I can put him in something and he's going to be successful. So it's, when I find some of those, you know, those people I hang on to them. Terrific. So let me ask you, a lot of people think that people start companies because they want to make a lot of money. Now looking at all of the things you've done, I'm making the assumption that that's not really an issue for you anymore and you keep doing this. So what motivates you? What is, what is keeping you going? I mean, this is hard work every day. A lot of uncertainty. You're juggling all this stuff. What's your major motivation? Well, it's not money. No one in the right mind would do this for money. You know, I think it's problems. I have this thing that when a problem gets hold of me, I can't shake it unless I figure out that I can't solve it. Or if I figure out that I can solve it, then I am not satisfied with just in a theoretical solution. To me, these solutions are not complete unless you bring them to life and commercialize them. So it's a, to me, that is the most challenging and trying, at times trying and difficult but when you reach the end, it's an amazing feeling that you did something, created something out of nothing. So what would your typical day be like? I mean, I'm trying to imagine, I know what it's like to run one company. What is it like every single day? What are you doing? You know, an easy day is different. If, you know, for example, today I spent the morning just before I came, I was six hours in a design review for one of my companies and I had the whole engineering team and we were going through details. But if I look at generally how I spend my time, a lot of my time goes in fundraising because with seven or eight companies, at least one or two companies are raising money at any given point at a time. So I'm raising money which is not the most enjoyable thing to do. But apart from that, I'm working with scientists and engineers some of the time I spend actually in the lab and I'm hiring people. A lot of, you know, with all these companies, I have design reviews and brainstorming sessions and planning animal studies. As these companies grow, I get involved with the regulatory strategy, clinical strategy. So you're intimately involved with all these companies? As on an operations level? Yes, up to a certain point. Now, a company like Zonare which is generating revenue and the products are pretty stable. I'm less involved with them. I'm a company that is brand new and I'm just being, I spend a lot of time. It's like children, you know, the older they are, the less maintenance. They need as much money. They need as much money. They need as much money. They need as much money. They need as much money. Some of them. So do you invest in any of these entries yourself? Yes, so you know, this fundraising process has been so painful for the last 30 years that I decided to raise a venture fund myself. So which I have, and I do invest in other people's companies. I've been doing that for, in fact, I'm a partner at Drewefischer-Jovitz. And I have been there with one of their global funds for the last six, seven years. And investing in lifelines companies and I'll continue to do that. And investing in my own company. So, right. So you set up this fund and is there any conflict of interest there in terms of, you know, having a fund and then investing in your own ventures? You know, yes, of course. But the simple rule about conflict of interest, if you don't have a conflict of interest, you're not doing anything interesting. So, so my, my, the absolute rule. But the second part of it is that you deal with conflict of interest by transparency and disclosure. And, and, you know, most people are comfortable with that. So you've done all these amazing things. And now you look at this room full of all of these students who many of whom would love to be sitting in your place a few years from now. They're very, well, they're very passionate. I know about solving big problems and they're trying to figure out how did they start doing that. Are there things that you wish you had learned in school that would have made things easier for you? You know, I absolutely, I think from a scientific and technical standpoint, I had a very, very strong background foundation. So I could, I could go into new areas and, and, and develop that expertise. But I, I never took a single business course or accounting course or finance or marketing. And, and I had to focus on all these things in building companies. And that, that was, that was a challenge. So marketing and all that came naturally, but, you know, accounting, I had to hire an accountant to teach me, you know, how do you read a balance sheet and income statement? I didn't know that when I first started a company. So I wish I had some of that, but, but, but, earlier. So what you're saying is pick up some of those basic skills. Yeah. Accounting, business, marketing. I mean, you have to, as an entrepreneur, if you're starting a company, you really have to know every aspect of your business. You may not be an expert in every aspect, but you really need to know what needs to be done. How do you make this thing work? What kind of people do you bring in? And when you have people working, you should be able to figure out if they're doing a good job or not. And unless you really understand their work, you won't be able to do that. So I really think that a broad understanding is important, but depth is important too. You can't just have, you know, a broad understanding of everything, but no depth. One of the things we always say is that we want T-shaped people, right? People with a depth of understanding in one area, but a breadth of understanding of different disciplines. I think at least in medicine, in my field, you need depth in multiple areas. It's not enough to be a good electrical engineer. I mean, I have to spend, you know, if you look at my patents, I have as many things in electrical engineering as in mechanical engineering and cell biology, protein chemistry, software. So these are multidisciplinary problems, that most of the problems that we deal with. And so you really have to generate or develop depth in multiple areas. You know, for instance, I started two of my companies were in the security business. And they were both quite successful. And it was, you know, again, that particular problem got hold of me and I had to solve that. So I think you're talking about problems. I mean, this is one of the things we talk about all the time is that problems are opportunities. And that's really what entrepreneurship is all about is identifying those problems and then turning them into opportunities. When you look around the world right now, what big problems, obviously you can't solve them all. What problems would you say would be really exciting for students today to be looking out for? I mean, there are problems everywhere, you know, in medicine. You know, that's where I have spent all my life. There are lots of problems that are either poorly solved or not solved at all. So you don't have to dig very deep to find those, you know, from diabetes, heart disease, orthopedic problems, central nervous system. We really are beginning to scratch the surface. We don't understand the CNS very well. So there are lots of problems to solve. There are other kinds of problems, you know, in this country there are about 47 million or 50 million people without health insurance. How do you make health insurance available to lots of people? That's a mind-twister. And I guess these guys and these politicians are trying to figure it out. But I think scientists should put their minds to it. You create a lot of things to it, you create creativity and whatnot. So there are some big problems like that. And cancer is still unsolved. But I think there are some really interesting solutions on the horizon. So I'm going to ask one more question and I'm going to open it up for the audience. I want you guys to start thinking about what questions, because you're going to get a great entrepreneurship week t-shirt if you have a great question. What other advice would you want to give to students? We talked about what should they learn in school, you know, find, get some business background. But just looking back over your career, what other general advice would you want to give to them, or that you wish someone had given to you when you were still a student? Oh, I wish I've made so many mistakes along the way. I think you have to be a good listener and really recognize that you don't have all the answers. And don't fall in love with your ideas because sometimes the very first idea is not the right idea. So you really have to, and you know, when you have a few failures under your belt, you really is a humbling experience and you listen more. But if you're starting out as an entrepreneur, be a good listener, surround yourself with people who are experienced. And I think, I mean, my style is, I question everything, even when I hear it from the experts. And I want to satisfy myself. So you know, a lot of times I've done things where the experts said it was not needed or couldn't be done or shouldn't be done. And I would always ask why? And you know, it's the question, how do you get to the heart of the problem? And you have to do the lot of investigation and what not, learning about the problem. Unless you know, you see sometimes somebody else might define the problem and you build a company around it. Those things are very dangerous. I think sometimes physicians might come up with an idea that is not really, they fall in love with the idea. But an entrepreneur, talking to them might think that since it's a physician, it must be a big idea. So I've seen so many companies being formed by physicians. They were making small incremental improvements on existing products and there was not worthy of becoming a company. Perhaps it was a good improvement that should have been licensed. So you have to really assess what you're getting into a front. So that must take a tremendous amount of discipline to basically question everything. Because it certainly would be easier to sort of read something and say, okay, great, I can put this aside. You now understand this and move on. As opposed to going and constantly digging things up again and saying, is this really true? Right, absolutely. Okay, so we have some time for some questions who would like to start. Okay, back there. Yeah, as someone who's interested in both medicine and engineering considering graduate school in both those areas, I was wondering what in retrospect, what part of that training you view as most importantly? Could you have gotten by without some of it and then kind of picked it up along the way or part of that thing? So please repeat the question for the listeners. So the question is what the mix of training with medicine and engineering, what part of training was more important? I think to me the most important part of my training was the training in fundamentals. So it was electromagnetic fields to thermodynamics, heat transfer, fluid flow. These are the foundations of all other things that you have to deal with in medicine and chemistry and biochemistry and cell biology. So you really have to pay attention to all these foundational things. And then you can build all kinds of things on top of that. Next question. Yep. I mean, I was looking at the matter, but I'm very curious to hear about your first company. What was the concept of how you started college in combination with the right of thinking about what you did? Well, I'm interested in long, long answer, small short question. The question is what was my first company how I got started. I was still in medical school, third year of medical school. And I came across a cardiologist from Johns Hopkins, Dr. Michel Medovsky. And he had had a personal episode and had lost his best friend in a sudden cardiac death episode. And he was heartbroken and he said there should have been some technology that could have saved him or should have saved him. And he started the concept that there should be a defibrillator that you could wear or put inside your body. So he didn't really have a technical background, engineering background, but he identified that need. And he went to Metronik and said, Metronik was a small pacing company then. This is in the early 70s, 72, 73, or thereabouts. And Metronik looked at that and said, you're crazy, it can't be done. And so I ran into him at one of these conferences, this is in 77, 78. And during this time he was tinkering at Johns Hopkins in the basement with some grad students and really not getting anywhere with it. And so I looked at that and I said, of course this can be done. And I can do it. And I was 23, 24 years old and 23 years old. And I didn't know how to raise money. And we talked to a lot of people and those days venture capital didn't exist. I hadn't even heard of venture capital. So we got a corporate investor in Pittsburgh and the company called Intek was formed. And within five years we developed the implantable defibrillator and sold it to Eli Lilly, which then spun out guidance, which became the foundation of guidance. How many implantable defibrillators are there on the market or implanted in people now? Oh, probably a couple million maybe. I know my father has one. I thank you. So that was a real challenging project and really pushed the boundaries of engineering just to get that done. And at that point were you hooked? I mean once you did your first one, did you say, okay, I do say that. Well that was really my first one. The first one was I was, I was actually an undergraduate, Rudger's, and a friend of mine had a break in and he said, you know, I need an alarm system. So I said, well I can design and build one. So I designed one and built one and installed it in his home. And that was such a nicely done thing that all his friends wanted it. So I started a business and I would, in weekends and nights, I would build these things and install them. I did nice income. So I had set up a sub, you know, S sub chapter S company and used my credit cards and say, you know, so it was a painful way of building a company with no capital. And so I had tasted that failure, the trials of building a company with no money. Great. How do you think that a startup is different than the incubator environment as opposed to trying to do it in your garage? You know, I, the first eight or ten companies I did in my garage. And, you know, when I was doing electronics and mechanical engineering kind of companies, I could do that in my head. I didn't even need a garage. And in fact, several of these companies, I would just sketch it on a piece of paper and get it funded. No prototypes, nothing. But then when I started working with cell biology and protein chemistry and tissue engineering, and I realized that I needed a laboratory environment where I could do that. The second thing that prompted me to set up a, and my own lab was that I was working on multiple projects. So if I, in the past, when I was involved with the company, I raised money for it. And if I come up with a new idea, if I do it in that company, in that building, using those resources, the investors and the shareholders say, this is our idea, this belongs to us. And so I had to do everything outside the company. So I'd have a day job building that company, and then at night I'm trying to do this, keep these things separate. And there was the other reason what prompted me to create my own laboratory space. And here are the chats to live your life over multiple times. What are the career paths to think of? So I could repeat that. If I had to live my life over again. If I had a chance to live my life again, what would I do differently, or what other career? You know, sometimes some of us are wired from childhood. I was wired from my childhood to be a scientist and an entrepreneur. You know, I remember back when I was, you know, 10, 11 years old, I would build toys in my free time and take them to school and sell them to other kids. So, you know, this was in my blood. So you are a natural born entrepreneur. I've been doing it for 40 years. Did I need something about you that you took apart some of the toys that your parents started buying you two toys? One for you to play with and one for you to take apart? Yeah, you know, I actually used, when I was two, three, four years old, I used to tear apart every toy to see how it was. And in those days, you know, in the 60s, things were all mechanical, wind up toys and whatnot. So I would take them apart and couldn't put them back together. So I told my mother that you should always get me two. So I can play with one and take one apart. So she started doing that for a very young age. Great. Yeah. So the big company is not dead. Certainly Google turned into a big company until Apple. Your idea of building a company that then becomes acquired has that fast limber kind of thing. Do you want to talk at all more about the trade off of the value of creating something that just goes huge and becomes a gigantic company versus, you know, a lot of people say, well, the product is not a company. We don't fund products. We fund companies. What's the difference between a product and a company and how do you know when you have one or the other? That's a very good question. The question is several questions there. How do you build a large company scale, the company yourself, rather than selling it? And how do you know when you have just a product or a company on your hand? A simple test for that is market size. Are you solving a problem for a large market? You know, if you're, for example, a gastric pacemaker for obesity, that could be a multi-billion dollar. If you're successful, multi-billion dollar product. An incremental improvement in an existing product is if you wouldn't build a company around it. Or if the market was, you know, $50 million a year, it would be very hard to build a company around that. So market size is really what dictates whether you build a company or treat it as a product that you perhaps license. I think the reason, I mean, many of these companies who, let's take the case of metronik, they're a big company. But these companies have become big somewhat accidentally. You know, they had a single product company for a long time. But they were lucky enough to get to a critical mass where they could use that currency or their money and their stock value to acquire other companies and diversify. So, you know, their handful of Boston scientists grew the same way. And J&J started with a single small business and they started. So, you know, if you're successful at one, Fox Hall, I mean, there are some recent examples that are growing into diversified companies. But the risk there is very high. You know, you have a very high probability. Even if you have successfully developed a product, one hiccup there and you essentially go into shutdown mode. Because by then your expenses, monthly expenses are very high. And unless you're bringing in revenue, you can sustain that very long. So, the risks are very high for single product companies. And that's why you see so few of them turn into the metronik of the world of Google's. Another question? What's the role of the system? Pardon me? What's the role of the system? You know, my wife is sitting here and my daughter. I have five kids, four girls and a boy. And, you know, I really have fun with my wife and kids. And I really want them to learn, to look at the world the way I look at the world. And, you know, identifying, looking at problems as opportunities and identifying those and becoming problem solvers. Because that's whether you're in medicine or engineering or, you know, in any other field in business, identifying opportunities and solving those problems is really how you impact a lot of people. How do you do that with your kids? How do you do that? Do you give them a lot of problems? You know, my son, for example, he, from age 10, he's 27 years old. So, from age 10 to age 18, he worked every summer in one company or the other. And when he started, he was doing, you know, mail sorting. But towards then, he was writing software for keeping track of patent databases and stuff like that. And after he graduated, the first thing he did was he wanted to build a company. And so, he started his first company and he's working on it. I don't know if it will be successful. Did you find it? No. Great. Next question. Yeah. You're responding how you think the medical device industry has changed our last decade. And also, any distinction to garnered from making medical companies that you've learned that you know in two decades of your time? How has the medical device industry changed over the last many years? And what was the second part? Any real distinction to be far and bring many companies that you always apply to them in your newest endeavors? Yeah. So, medical device industry has become more exciting. There are a lot more people building companies. In the early 80s, there were 10 of us doing it. Now there are a thousand of us doing it. So, that's very exciting. The pace of innovation has increased. What I look at, you know, I'm always trying to figure out a risk that I face, risks that my business faces. And so, at any given point in time, I sort of write down the top three risks I'm facing. So, I really go after this. So, when I first start a company, I don't really build any milestone charts and project plans. I think that when you're dealing with some really red-hot, white-hot risks, you really focus on those, solve them, and then step back and say, okay, now what are the other risks? So, you're constantly, you're in the risk management business building a company. So, you really have to take care of those risks. Now, there comes a point when you can say, okay, now it's an execution play. So, at that point, you do the project planning and all that. Great. Do you have any more questions? Great. Do you feel that you generally have more ideas than you pursue than you can personally incubate? And so, do you think about filling up activities of YouTube left? So, the question is, do I have more ideas than I can handle? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I probably have 10 companies buzzing around in my head at any given time. But I just, you know, sometimes I never get to them because someone else does it. And, yeah, that is a real problem for me. A big problem. Well, you know what, I want to thank you so much. This was absolutely terrific. I think that all of you, hopefully, are as impressed with me as I am and wish you the best of success with all your next ventures. Thank you. Thank you.
