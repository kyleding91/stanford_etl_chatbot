 You were listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at edcorner.stanford.edu. It is now my wonderful pleasure to introduce our terrific speaker today. Tom Telly comes to us from IDEO, which is probably a stone's throw from Stanford and a really good friend of the Stanford community. If you don't know about IDEO, IDEO has designed so many products that you probably use in your everyday life. Everything from the crest meets squeeze tube to the original Palm Five and the mouth, but they also have done a lot of really amazing things recently where they've been designing things well beyond products. They design experiences. They work with the Red Cross to design the whole blood donation process. They'll design the office of the future. Tom has been at IDEO for 21 years. He works there with his brother David, who was the founder of IDEO, and he's been there since the company was just a handful of designers and now has 350 people there. Tom also is the author of two really interesting books. One of them is called The Art of Innovation, and I actually use the book as a textbook in my course on creativity innovation. And his second book is The Ten Faces of Innovation. And Tom has agreed to stick around afterwards to sign books. Their books are going to be on sale outside, but in addition, we have a special surprise because a handful of you in this room selected randomly will get some signed copies for free. So stick around after the talk and I'll tell you how that's going to happen. So without further ado, Tom Kelly. Well, hi, good afternoon. So I'm going to talk today about staying young at heart, going to talk about how to be an innovator for life. And I have to confess, this is all a bit experimental in the sense that this is the first time that I'll be covering most of this material. And I would love to have had another, oh, I don't know, month or so to let some of these ideas just percolate along in the back of my mind, but we don't have a month, right? So that's the global innovation tournament starts today. So if you think of this as kind of an experiment, we know not all experiments succeed, but I'm hoping that this one will. And so all of my previous writing, my research, my speaking has been about this, you know, ideas approach to innovation in an organizational setting. And so I've had a great conversation with lots of teams and team leaders. In fact, I've sat across the desk from over 1,500 client groups to talk about innovation. But what's new today is I'm going to try to apply it at the personal level, right? Innovation made personal. I'm going to try to apply it to individuals specifically to young creative individuals, like which we have many in the room whose careers and whose lives are just radiating possibilities right now. You know, you've got so much in front of you, there's so many opportunities. I was over at the coho, the coffee shop the other day, and they've got these pictures on the wall of what they gauge to be the most famous Stanford grads ever. And some of them are like movie actors and some of them are recognizable founders of big companies that I'm thinking, you know, in the room today there are people who will have their picture up on that wall. We just don't know which of you it is, right? And so I know given the age of many in the audiences, in the audience, not many of you have at least fallen very deeply into any particular ruts just yet, yet. But you know, you'll have the chance to do that later. But so my message today is mainly about nurturing or building or reinforcing your creative potential, your creativity, your capacities for innovation so that they can stand the test of time. And I think both the good news and the bad news on this young at heart thing comes from Pablo Picasso who said a long time ago he said, you know, every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once you grow up, right? And I think what Picasso was talking about is that as you get older and his responsibility to start piling onto you, the next thing you know, it will almost seem as if circumstances are conspiring against you, right? There are forces like erosion and things that, you know, and entropy that try to chip away at your creative energy. But if you're willing to work at it a little bit, you can reinforce your abilities, you can, you can prevent that from happening or you can at least fight against those, those forces as a way to stay young at heart. My favorite books on creativity innovations by a guy named Gordon McKenzie is called Orbiting the Giant Hairball. Anybody ever read this book? Not too many. Currently out of stock at the Stanford bookstore in case anybody's interested in like dashing over there to get it. But anyhow, Gordon McKenzie, great guy, he was an artist. He was also, he worked most of his career at Hallmark Cards, but he's an artist. He made these really funky but fun sculptures. He welded together out of rusted steel. And what he would do is he spoke to a lot of school groups, and I mean grade school groups. And so he'd go, and he was prepared to do what, what, I'm not sure I would be prepared to do, which is he was prepared to speak to each class individually. Which is to say he started with a kindergarten kids in the morning and then he spoke to the first graders and the second graders and the third graders and the fourth graders until he got to the sixth graders late in the day. He must have been really tired by that point. But he asked them, he started the same way with all of the groups. He started the same ways and he said, look, I'm an artist. And I love to be around other artists. And he says, I look at your walls and you've got art on the walls so there must be artist here. Anybody here an artist? Right? And he's asking the kindergarteners, right? And some of you can remember kindergarten, others you can remember kindergarten for your kids. And what do kindergarteners do? Everybody in the class is up like this. Yeah, yeah, I'm an artist. I'm an artist. Right? Everybody is in the class of the arts. They're not just an artist. They're an enthusiastic artist. Right? And so he does that again of the first graders and still, every hand is up, not as much dancing around, not as many double hand raises, but everybody's still an artist. And he says, you get to the second grade, which is where you have your first little bit of attrition. Not every single kid raised their hand. You get to the third grade, the fourth grade, the fifth grade, end of the day, you get to the sixth graders. And these kids are old enough to understand this. He asks the question about who's an artist. And when he asks the question of the sixth graders, there's only two hands go up. And the people, the kids, raising their two hands, they're looking around kind of nervously to see if they're going to be judged by their peers. And so Gordon McKenzie asked the sixth graders, he says, hey, what happened to all the artists in this school? He said to all the other artists, transfer out? He said to all the other artists go to art school? He says, I don't think so. Said I think something much worse. He said, I think someone or something is told you it's not okay to be an artist. And he said, if you don't remember anything else I say today, he said, I want you to go home and remember it's okay to be an artist. And so this is part of my message today. It's okay to be an artist, right? It's okay to be an innovator. It's okay to be a design thinker, even if it causes people around you to raise their eyebrows. Right, especially if it causes people around you to raise their eyebrows. You know, I have a personal story about this. My wife, Yumi, is a Japanese immigrant. She had never been to America when I met her. In fact, she'd barely been out of Japan when I met her long ago and far away in an Australian bus stop. Right, but after Yumi moved to America, she would occasionally have this thing she would say to me, I was misbehaving in some way. I was being the innovator or something and she would say, oh, Tomson, you are like a child. Right, and looking back on it, I'm sure she meant that as a criticism. Right, but I took it as a high compliment. Like a child, that's pretty good. Right, and we've managed to live happily ever after for a pretty long time using this technique of taking the bad things that do one the other person says to you in a interpreted and a good way. Right, in fact, it was 20 years ago, exactly. In fact, it was 20 years ago, almost to this hour in which her parents crossed the Pacific for the first time in their lives. And my parents, I can say this, my parents crossed America so they can meet up here in San Francisco so that we could have an international wedding. So 20 years ago today, I got to get out of here after I'm done talking so I can take my wife out to dinner. So, but if you think back to it, even with her broken English 20 years ago, my wife still got it linguistically correct when she said you are like a child. She said, you know, that's like childlike. Because in the English language, we make a pretty big distinction between childlike, which is all positive in my mind, and childish, which is pretty negative, it translates pretty much as selfish. So if you want to be an innovator for life, be childlike as often as possible, but childish not too often, right, as little as you can. So this is partly this idea about innovator for life. This idea of building up momentum is partly about starting good habits. So just as you could start now, you know, with a good habit that relates to health and wellness, if you could, starting today, eat edamame as we do at our house, you might imagine instead of potato chips or pork rinds or whatever your snack of choice is, if you could do that and start that habit and continue it on, that would contribute to your health and wellness over the course of your life, right? And in the same way, you can start mental or behavioral habits that will help you be an innovator for life. So it's really about forming habits now that are going to help you, that are going to help you later on. And I came up with five habits. I'm sure if you put your mind so you could come up with a lot more, but for purposes of the time we have available to it, I think five will be plenty. You want it to be seven plus or minus two if you've read that research. And so five, nice and easy. And the first one, when it made me my favorite of them, is think like a traveler. Right, it's easy for me to do this. I spend a hundred nights a year away from home and so I think like a traveler all the time. I'm on a plane. But what I mean when I say think like a traveler is, ever notice when you go to a distant city, especially when you travel internationally, ever notice that there's a piece of your brain that is turned up on high, right? You're in this hyper-aware state where you notice everything, right? You notice how the coins and the money is different. It's all better than the money in America, by the way. We got a billion graphic designers or something in America. This is the best we can do. Our money is all green. I can't figure that out. But, you know, coins, we can't do the dollar coin. Anyhow, don't get me started. So you notice that the money is different. You notice the shoes are different. In fact, when you're overseas, it's almost the surefire way to spot an American is look at their shoes. I don't know why. We always have different shoes than people in Europe or Asia or whatever. You notice the way they serve coffee is different. You notice the trains are different. You know, little bits of things in your brain is on high alert. It must have something to do with evolution or, you know, looking out for predators or something because when you are traveling internationally, that part of your brain is super active, right? And, you know, Tina, I don't know if anybody realizes this. Actually, neuroscientists, I bet she could tell us which part of the brain it is. I don't really care. All I'm saying is whatever part of that brain is that is super active when you're traveling internationally, try to turn up that part of your brain all the time, right? Because if you can do that, if you can have a higher state of awareness that people around you have, you will spot more opportunities and those opportunities will have value for it. So, you know, if you can observe more, if you can learn more, if you can get a better or more up to date, we'll come back to that a minute, a more up to date view of human behavior, that gives you power. That gives you credibility as an innovator because something that's going to happen to most of the students in the room is you're going to someday soon join an organization in which people are twice your age and have ten times your experience. And they will mentally try to use that against you, right? And you might find that ever so slightly intimidating, but just remember this. If you capture your ideas, if you write them down, if you, you know, find some way not to have your observations run down the drain. Everybody's got a different way of doing this. For me, it shows you how old I am. Maybe it's for me, it's a piece of paper, it's a little pad in my back pocket. But for you, it could be something on your smartphone, it could be something on your laptop, it could be something in your blog. But if you can capture those things and then use them as you try to make contributions to organizations, you've got to remember, you are the world, you know, undisputed expert of your own experience. So try to capture the lessons from your experiences you will be able to use those in organizational settings. So that's this idea about thinking like a traveler. You know, I think Yogi Berra, former catcher for the New York Yankees, I was like, he kind of addressed this issue when he said you can observe a lot by watching. And I like Yogi Berra. He liked that phrase so much. That's what he called his book, by the way. But I think I get more value from this other guy, from this writer Marcel Pruss, who said, the real act of discovery consists not in finding new lands that's traveling, right? But in seeing with new eyes, which is thinking like a traveler. And wow, the seeing with new eyes thing, it gets harder, the older you get, the harder this becomes. So you, you know, joining new organizations, this is something you can offer to everybody. They don't want your advice right away from my experience. But keep track of it, keep track of your thoughts. What surprised you? What disappointed you? What seemed weird about the business or the organization you are entering because you'll be able to use that later? And so this is this, this freshness at Idle we call it the eggs teaching the chickens. You know, people who don't know, quote, the way things are done often have big ideas about how to change them. But the flip side of this is when people have been working in their careers for a very long time, right? And what happens is they develop deep expertise. And that deep expertise is extremely valuable to the organization. But in the process of developing that deep expertise, they start screening stuff out. They start trying to eliminate, quote, distractions from the way things are and therein lies a problem. And so the AG Lafley, CEO of Procran Gamble, used to bring his senior management team out to visit Idle in California once a year. Forty of the most senior people in this great consumer products company, and we would say to them, look, you know more about your business than we are ever going to learn, right? But for purposes of today, if we're going to do these observations together, we want you to set aside some of what we know. We want you to see with new eyes. In fact, we even have an expression to describe the state of mind that we try to get people into to see with new eyes. We borrowed this expression, by the way, from Bob Sutton, anybody know Bob? I'm just guessing lots of people. Anyhow. Bob Sutton, Bob and Turnbarlett, from a guy you may have heard of named George Carlin. You know, there's this well-known expression, there's an expression from the dictionary, used around the world untranslated from the French. I spoke last year, year before last, I spoke in 16 countries. And in all 16 countries, they used this expression, deja vu, right? You've heard a deja vu been there before, right? This is the opposite of deja vu. It's called Boujade. Boujade is when you're in a place you've been a million times before and you're seeing it with fresh eyes and you start asking, why do we do it this way? Why is it always that way? And so if you can get this concept, this state of mind called Boujade, it helps you to think like a traveler, it helps you to see with fresh eyes. So here's some good news about this. Think like a traveler thing. If you have time to go out and get a PhD in something like ethnography or cultural anthropology, I recommend it. We have lots of those people that I do, they're brilliant people, their work is very interesting, I have learned a lot from them. So if you want to go for the PhD in that, that's a good idea. In fact, I would really urge you to take at least one anthropology course before you leave campus. But the good news is you can do this, right? Because I've had zero courses in anthropology and yet I've discovered not only can I switch into this mode, this anthropologist mode, this thing like a traveler mode, not only can I switch into it, I have trouble switching out of it. I'm always in this mode, trying to write things down and look at what's happening in the world around me with respect to human behavior. So this is I was in Paris a couple years ago now and I go to Paris Airport, Charles De Gaulle, anybody been to that airport? Oh, lots. Anybody like that airport? Not me. Anyhow, it turns out I just think there's that last summer, it's two airports. There's this really ugly old round one that they make us American co-to. There's the one that I'm talking about here, there's actually quite a nice terminal two next door that I've never seen, it's like they wouldn't let me in because they saw my passport was from somewhere else. Anyhow, so I'm talking about the old one, you go to the old one, it's in the circle, I get to go around two or three times getting lost. So eventually you get out and you take this train into town and I love that they've got the train into town worked out so well, we're not very good at that in the US, but they've got this train and it's safe and it's fast and it's clean and it costs seven euros, I think they raised it to eight this year. So it's all good except for one thing. Except for if you want to get on that train in the airport, if you want to get on that train and go into town, you got to get past these turn styles. The hardest this is to imagine, I can't process this in my brain, hard is this is to imagine, is nearly as I can tell the architects, the engineers, the designers who created this train station on the airport, I guess it never crossed their mind that people arriving in the biggest airport in the country forgot sake, we're going to have, you know, luggage. And so what I experienced was it was Bambner impossible to get through that turn style with my two bags. But you know, I traveled pretty light and so although I was kind of anxious to get into Paris, I actually hung out in the airport for 15 minutes to watch how other people did it. And I can report in 15 minutes of watching zero, zero people made it through that turn style easily the first time. I saw gambits, you know, I saw strategies. The most important one, the most successful one not being used by this couple is the two person method. As in honey, you go through first and I'll pass you the bags, right? I saw solo travelers toss their bag across the turn style and I deal that's what we call a drop test, right? You see if your computer can stand up to four feet on the concrete, right? But I saw zero people, zero people make it through there easily. But here's why it's, you know, Vujade, here's why it relates to thinking like a traveler because there are people who work in that airport every day. They've been working there for years and they never even noticed. That this was a problem, right? And I don't think it's just because they're French people, right? So I worked just down the street from Paul Safo at the end of the future and Paul says, I don't know who it was that discovered water, but I'm sure it was not a fish, right? You get immersed in your environment and you stop seeing stuff and this is where you with your new eyes, this is where you think like a traveler, you can spot stuff and say, hey, look at that. Hey, look at that. What did we just see there? And sometimes the answer to what did we just see there is an opportunity, right? And so you encourage you to keep that part of your brain turned up on high because you can get value from it. It can enhance your credibility, your power as an innovator out there. And it's just so you don't think that this is a mental exercise because of course, having spotted this in the French train station at the airport, nobody's actually asking me to do anything about it, right? And so at that point, all I'm really doing is exercising my muscle, right? I'm developing that part of my brain so when it comes around to something that does matter, you know, we can apply it. And so here's a case. I have 4,000 cases like this at IDO. I'll pick just this one. It's quite a simple one, but I think it illustrates the point. About 10 years ago, we got approached by one of the largest oral health care companies in America, company you've probably heard of called Oral B. And they said, look, we'd like a new kids toothbrush because ours is starting to get commoditized. It looks like a lot of kids toothbrushes out there and you can't have that. We want to be special, right? So we say, okay, we'll do this. We want to go out in the field and do some field research. And they're kind of not sure about that. Like it's not rocket science. We're talking about kids brushing their teeth, how hard could that be, right? They would really like us to stop fooling around and start designing, right? But we want to go through this process, this observation process because we think almost always you can spot opportunities. And so we go out and we're on like the first day of observations and we make a small discovery. Small discovery we make is that every kid's toothbrush in the history of the world has had the same implicit assumption. It's a logical assumption. It just isn't exactly right. Which is the assumption always was parents have big hands, kids have small hands. And so when you want to make the kids version, make it like the parents brush only smaller and skinnier. Perfectly logical until you go out in the field. Until you actually watch humans, little tiny humans, brush in their teeth. And what you notice right away, you get a five year old boy brushing his teeth, he's not holding his toothbrush in his fingertips the way mom and dad do. He's fifting it. He's holding it like this because he doesn't have the dexterity. He doesn't have the fine motor controls that his parents have. And so he's got to hold it like this. In fact, the other thing he does is he holds the brush too far up very frequently. And so he's punching himself in the face as he's trying to brush his teeth. And we solve that problem too. But the main thing was came back to the field and said, uh oh, kids don't need little skinny toothbrushes. Kids need big fat toothbrushes. Let's make a big fat squishy toothbrushes. And you may have noticed now every toothbrush company in the world makes these. There are client reports that after we made that little tiny discovery out in the field sitting in a bathroom watching a five year old boy brush his teeth, they had the best selling kids toothbrush in the world for 18 months. So when you think about power, when you think about, you know, credibility, if you could go out in the field and do that observation and come up with that finding and your company, your organization was the best in its field for 18 months afterwards. Would that be worth it? I think that would be worth it. And so that's this message about think like a traveler, being anthropologist, use your powers of observation, have that part of your brain turned up as high as you can, uh, all along. So that's the first one. Promise not to spend as long on the next. But the second one is called think like in a, I mean, is a treat life as an experiment. And this is partly about risk. This is partly about actually being willing to fail. Because experiments, as I said earlier, they're not all successes. That's why they call them experiments. Right? And so if you treat life and experiment, you got to be prepared for some stuff not to work out. You know, I'm an author and I take this approach with books too because you can, you're going to a bookstore and you look at books, you know, the average book is like 300 pages long. That can be intimidating. If you, you know, if mom raised you that once you start something, you got to finish it. Then a 300 page book, there's some big risk in cracking it open, right? Whereas if you treat that as an experiment and say, look, I'm just going to read the first 10 pages and then see how I feel and if that's good, I'm going to continue, right? Then a book is not so scary. Then next thing, you know, you read 10, 20, and 30 and if it's a good book, you get all the way through it, right? But what got you into it in the first place is you were willing to treat it as an experiment. Because if you go whole hog, if you got to, you know, do the whole thing, you know, that scares people away. And so you can go through your whole life with this method of like, look, I'm going to try this. Because if anything for a day, I can, you know, I'm going to see how this works. And so you get in the habit of, you're failing, but ideally you're failing forward. You're failing in a way that has a little bit of learning attached to each one. And historically, the most famous guy in this experiment or category here in the US is this guy, right? Thomas Edison, right? And do we tend to think of Thomas Edison as a success? Right? I think we do. I think he's the most prolific inventor in the history of America. He made, you know, light bulbs, of course, we all know, phonographs, he's, you know, he had a whole long list of things including tattoo pens. In fact, I think we're still using Edison's design today in the tattoo pen department. He also left us General Electric, which is going pretty strong still after all these years, 120 years or whatever it is. But Edison, we think him was success. Success? No, he was piling up all kinds of failures. He wouldn't use that word. At one point in his life, he said, well, I haven't failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that do not work. He was trying to come up with the filament for an electric light bulb. 10,000 things he tried. Think how frustrating that must have been. Well, he stuck with it. You know, it worked out pretty well in the end. So he treated life as an experiment. He had this great group, this great team around him. And they were doing multiple experiments every day until they came up with success. And the fact that one of them failed, no big deal. He got 9,000 other failures out there. And so Edison, way long time ago, so some people, especially people that age some of the people in the room think, oh, that's a 19th century example. Don't talk to me about that. Here's two examples from the 20th century that have spilled over into the 21st century, WD40. Anybody have any WD40 at home? Right? I suppose it's not that convenient in dorm rooms. But trust me, almost every house in America's got WD40. I've spoken Brazil recently and they all had WD40 in their houses. Ever think about the name? I didn't. Right? WD. That's, well, that's obvious because it's an oil, right? So it does water displacement, right? Catchy, name only an engineer could love. Anyhow, WD40 is what I want to talk about. 40 is because the first 39 formulas failed. They stuck with it to 39 failures. They got to formula number 40 and they did darn good with that one, right? This is a consumer product unchanged for about 50 years. You never get a chance to do that, but WD40 did. And then that is nothing compared to this guy, James Dyson. Anybody ever seen his iconic vacuums? They reportedly work pretty well. Anyhow, lots of people. Okay. Anyhow, James Dyson, if you read his book, Jim Dyson says he had 5,100,000 and 28 failures. 5,128 prototypes before he had something he could sell. Man, that must have taken a long time, right? But he did pretty well in the end. You know, he's one of the richest guys in the UK because his product ended up being such a tremendous success. But 5,128 failures along the way, I got two questions. I ever meet Jim Dyson, I'm asking him two things. The first thing is, why did you keep track? Right? Once I get over 1,000 failures, I would just say lots, you know, lots. I don't need to know that when I'm in the 5,000 failures, just a lot of failures, right? But way more important than that, and it relates to my comment earlier, is was he married at the time? Right, because that is one patient spouse. I can just see her saying, Jim, get out of the garage and get a job, right? But he didn't, and he stuck with it. He had lots of failures. He's willing to tolerate lots of failures, and it worked out pretty well for him in the end. So that brings us to number three, which I also stole from Bob Sutton, who with his permission, I was ever in Bob's office of the D school earlier today. And Bob's got this idea that I love, that I've fully adopted, called having an attitude of wisdom. By the way, those of you who don't know Bob, he's the one on the right with the clothes on. Anyhow, Bob, that was got this idea of an attitude of wisdom, which is a healthy balance between confidence in what you know and distrusting what you know just enough that keeps you thirsty for more knowledge. Because we've all met people in their lives who they get to be an expert, right? They develop this deep expertise, and then they want to rest on their laurels. I know a lot about that. I don't need to know more, right? And I've got to even count it some people like that. Life's in this resting on your laurels, especially with respect to learning, never a good idea. In fact, if you think about it, resting on your laurels, it wasn't even a good idea back when they had the laurel reefs. You know, we get that from like Julia Caesar's time, or something good happened, you get to wear the reeth of laurels. Right? But think about it. So Julia Caesar, case in point, right? Julia Caesar, 44 BC, he's made Emperor for Life. Right? Imagine that's a happy day, right? Emperor for Life, then have a nice ring to it. Right? You're not just Emperor for Life of Lithuania, right? You're Emperor for Life of the most powerful empire in the world. Right? Being a president of the US is nothing like that. You've got eight years, you've got to give it up, right? So he's Emperor for Life. He is the happiest, proudest guy in the world on that day. And he, you know what? He remained Emperor for Life. But his friends killed him a month later. Right? And so resting on your laurels, even back then, bad idea, certainly can't do it now. So on this attitude of wisdom, I think, you know, the very quotable Mark Twain, I love Twain. I don't even know if he said all that stuff, but if he did, I just want to follow him around, right and stuff down, as he said it. And he said at one point in his life, he said, it's not what you don't know that gets in the trouble. It's what you know for sure that ain't so. Right? And this, no for sure stuff can be really a problem for lots of people. I was in Istanbul recently with the very charismatic, executive vice president at Best Buy, you know, big retailer. And he told a story from before he joined the organization. He told this story about one of these things that you know for sure that ain't so. Apparently, in 2001, Best Buy, then as now, the largest consumer electronics retailer in America, right? So they know a lot about consumer electronics. They know a lot about people buying media, things like that. They want to expand their influence. And so they're looking around what their mergers and acquisitions had on. And they find this company called Musicland. Musicland, really big deal. They own Sam Goody stores. You know, they were a force to be reckoned with at the time. And it's 1,300 stores, biggest retailer of audio CDs and DVDs in America. And the boy, the management team at Best Buy thought this was really strategic. They were willing to pay billions of dollars for Musicland because it expanded their empire. It was so good. 2001, this is, right? Because they're confident they know how people buy consumer electronics. They know about media purchases except for one thing. The management team, probably in their 40s and 50s at Best Buy in Minneapolis, Minnesota, they hadn't noticed that there was this little company called Napster, started in 1999, two years before their purchase. And that this sea change had already started happening. In fact, it was well underway in 2001 when they made the purchase that, you know, 18 to 30-year-olds had basically stopped buying CDs completely. And we're downloading their music online in MP3s, right? And so this very smart group, people I've met, some of the management team, and they're very smart people, take nothing away from them. But they make this strategic mistake because they were sure that they knew about their market. And Cal Patel, this executive vice president telling the story, says, before the dust settled, five years later, when Musicland went bankrupt, Best Buy lost a billion dollars, right? So they lost a billion dollars because they were overconfident in their knowledge of the market. And he says, the really ironic thing of this is the trend had started with 18 to 30-year-olds. He said, ever been in one of our stores? He says, who's working in there? 18 to 30-year-olds. He says, in other words, not only do we miss the trend that happened the world, our own employees knew about it. But the information didn't filter up to the management team. And he said, we will make more mistakes in the future of Best Buy. But he says, we won't make that one again. We won't get overconvenient knowledge. We won't overlook data about trends that exists within our own team. And so that's the thing about things that you know for sure that ain't so. So I got invited about 2000 or 2001. I got invited to go to this Think Tank in Singapore. It's called the Islands Forum. And I said to one of my friends at the time, gee, this will be fun. I really know Singapore, right? I lived in Singapore, I wasn't for Singapore Airlines in the 1980s. And so I was really looking forward to that going back to this place that I knew. And I wasn't off that plane five minutes at Changi Airport, where I used to work for Singapore Airlines. Before it occurred to me, no duh. I don't know Singapore. I know Singapore 1985. And if you haven't looked lately, Singapore 1985 doesn't exist anymore. Right? And so I'm walking around with this misperception that I have knowledge that is in fact way out of date. And so as you get older, you've got to continuously hold up your worldview against the actual world that's out there to see where they disagree. And while they do disagree, you've got to continuously adjust your point of view. You've got to have an attitude of wisdom that allows you to adjust your point of view when the world turns a little bit when you're not looking. And so having learned that lesson, I'm quite sensitive to it of having the idea that I'm smart about something when I'm really the opposite. So let's see, we had think like a traveler, we had treat life as an experiment, we had an attitude of wisdom number four, has two parts actually. Part one is use your whole brain. Right? And since the year K through 12 education was so good at developing your left brain analytical skills, anybody from the law school or the business school here, very good at that. Like let's continue refining, let's continue exercising, fine tuning that your left brain. But in fact, there's lots of opportunities out there for your right brain to make its mark. Right? Roger Martin at University of Toronto calls it the opposable brain. You know, applying the left brain and right brain at the same time. And what I'd really love to do at this point is there was a wonderful presentation at the TED conference in Monterey this year. A woman named Jill Bolte Taylor, where she's talking about how the left brain and the right brain, she's a really pretty separate and she says, oh, let me show you what I mean. And she turns, there's a little screen here and she turns behind the screen and she comes out with a brain. With a human brain with the, with the, the, the, the, the, the, the spinal cord hanging down and I'm thinking, you don't see that every day. Right? So I wish I had the brain here, I could hold out. But basically, since your left brain is already very well taken care of this whole brain approach, the Dan Pink talks about in his great book, A Whole New Mind. It's really talking about bringing your right brain into play. And I'm going to go out on a limb and predict that the winners of this year's global innovation tournament, they're going to use a lot of right brain intuitive skills as part of their successful entry. So that's part one, use your whole brain. But part two is use this thing that Guy Claxon calls your tortoise mind. He's, he's a great book. He's called Hair Brain Tortoise Mind. And he says, the hair brain is the one you know really well. Hair Brain, that's the brain you can focus, you can concentrate with is under your direct control. But he says there's this other part of your brain that is not under your direct control. That's actually smarter than the hair brain. He calls it the tortoise mind. And this is where contemplation happens. This is where rumination happens. Your tortoise mind is working on things in the background all the time. And you can, if you work at it, you can actually assign little tasks to the tortoise mind. There are people who are really good at this, they'll write a question down before they go to sleep in the hopes that their brain will work on it overnight and maybe come up with an answer. So there are ways if you can address the tortoise mind, you can do things with it. I think that you know it's partly got the metaphor of growing an idea from seed. I worked in a farm in North Dakota one time, we were growing wheat. And you know all the concentration in the world, all the heat and light and moisture and fertilizer and everything you apply to that, you're not going to grow that wheat overnight. It just doesn't happen. It's not in the realm of possibility, growing wheat, just like growing certain kind of ideas takes time. And you try to build the right greenhouse. You try to build the right atmosphere, but you can't always accelerate the process. And so there are researchers now looking into the science of epiphany. People have these flashes of brilliance. Allegedly, you know, Newton is under the apple tree and the apple falls. And he suddenly is a fully foreign point of view about the idea called gravity. I seriously doubt that it happened exactly that way, but there are epiphany. There are aha moments. And what's really happening in that aha moment, according to the neurosciences looking into this, is it's not like you had a lightning bolt come down and deliver all that knowledge to it's that your tortoise mind has been working on this for days or weeks or months, or even in some cases even years, and you've just crossed the finish line. You've just gotten to a place where you say, oh, it's obvious now, isn't it? But it wasn't obvious for the previous, you know, however many number of years. So here's the thing is, if your mind is running like this, like Grand Central Station, it is a big distraction to the tortoise mind, right? Because the tortoise mind needs a little space. And so what you have to do, and this is sometimes easier said than done, you got to find a way to take some time to daydream. I had this for me personally. I, early in my ideal career, I was commuting from San Francisco. Now I can ride my bike to work and that's really quick. You know, I don't have to listen to those radio shows about, you know, where, you know, there's big traffic on, you know, the Caldeca tunnel or whatever, because I, you know, I got an eight minute bike ride. But in the old days, I had something approaching an hour commute, and I got addicted to audio books. Anybody else like audio books? I really got addicted. I listened to 300 audio books. I loved them. Basically, you leave me alone for a minute in a car or, you know, anywhere else the book is on. And that was all good. It was really entertaining. I still loved them. But when I started working on my first book, I realized that those audio books were kind of crowding out, you know, they were taking up all my attention. They were crowding out my ability to daydream. And so I actually dialed them way back in order to turn up my creative powers to write my first book, right? And so it's this, this chance of, you know, taking some time to daydream so that you can engage that, that tortoise mind, which is, you know, oh, it breaks me. The other thing, which is related to this daydream thing, which is finding your muse, right? So I have a set of things I could tell you. I could write them down, but it almost is irrelevant what my set of characteristics are that allow me to be most creative. But as part of your journey of self discovery, really important for you to figure out for you what, what unique set of circumstances help you be most creative. And it can be a whole host of things. It can be a certain type of music. I wrote two thirds of my current, my first book, listening to something called Brian Eno's Music for Airports. I doubted that will work for you. Really helped me a lot, right? It's about figuring out, do you like a lot of stimulus or do you like a lot of quiet? Are you best at certain times of day? You know, if you figure out through the self discovery that you are the most productive or the most creative between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. in the morning, then for God's sake, don't spend a minute doing email during those two hours. Don't go to anything called a status meeting during those two hours, because that's a precious commodity. That's when you're being visited by the muse, right? This is when you are most creative, and so you gotta leverage that. You gotta take advantage of that. Some people, by the way, find that they take a nap during the day. They're good in the morning, and then they're bad on the afternoon. They figure out that they take a nap midday. They can have two mornings. So whatever works for you, gotta figure this out. This is super important for you to know what your muse is. What set of circumstances allow you to be most creative. And in the old days, way, way back when Michelangelo was painting, this is the Cible of Delphi. He painted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Back then, they thought the muse was really fickle. I think you can manage the muse a little bit. They thought the muse was really fickle, and the muse wouldn't come to you sometimes. So what they did is said, well, if the muse won't come to you, you gotta go to the house of the muse. So they created back then this thing. You've probably heard of museums, house of the muse, right? And so you gotta find your own muse. What is right for you? I doubt that it's museums, but spend some time thinking about what's right for you. And so last to these five, these five habits, these five ideas about how you can be an innovator for life. Is this one called Follier Passion? Let me go back to that. Follier Passion. And to think about this, it sounds kind of corny. It sounds kind of trite, but this is really important. Because I got a lot of friends my age, and I can put them into two buckets. The people who follow their passions and love their life. They love their career. They are happy most of the time, and people who did not. And for the most part, some of them are pretty miserable. Or at best case, they're working for the weekend, right? Because all the fun happens in Saturday and Sunday, and that stuck during the week is awful, right? And try to avoid that fate if you can. I met Francis Ford Coppola last year. We were both in the same speaking calendar in Buenos Aires, Argentina. And Coppola said this thing. He said, it's kind of obvious, but he said, look, this is really simple. He said, do what you love. Not because you just want to be self-interested. He says, do it because you'll be better at it. He says, I love wine. And so I have a winery. And I think it's pretty good. He said, I love food. And so I have a restaurant business. And I have a pasta business. He's starting a resort, apparently, in South America. And he says he uses all of those just to generate cash so he can finance his own movies. And so pretty obvious, but I hadn't thought of it in those terms. Do what you love because you'll be better. You'll be willing to put in the extra time, the extra mental energy, because you love it. I saw, it's been several years ago, I saw Jim Collins speak. Anybody read any of his books? He wrote two great books. Oh, a lot of people. So built to last and then good to great. And it's several years ago and he used no slides of any kind. He's drawn circles in the air like this. But there was something he said that is stuck with me. I remember it like it was yesterday. And he was talking at first it seemed he was talking about companies. But as he got into it, it really seemed like he was talking to us each as individuals. And he said, trying to think of what you should do next, he says, think about these three circles. And the first circle is, what are you good at? He says, by the time you reach a certain age, most people have a sense of what they're good at. He says, but watch out for this circle. Because in this circle, he says, lives the curse of competence. Just because you're good at something doesn't mean you should do it. He says, you might be, if you look around your school or your office, you might discover you're the fastest person you ever met at the keyboard. He says, that means you should be a data entry operator? Probably not. He said, he was really good at math. And everybody said to him, Jim, should be a math major. And so he listened to that advice. And he got to school. And he was, he continued to be good at math, but he ran into people living in the second circle. And the second circle is, what are you born to do? Right? When are you the happiest? When are you in a state of flow? And he said, he met people, I think it was mostly guys, he met people who were never happier than when they were solving equations, right? And doing proofs. And he said, you know, I realized that good as I was at math, this is not my true calling. Right? And so he thought about those two circles. And then he thought about this third one. He says, don't overemphasize this one, but you got to think about it, which is, what will people pay you to do? Because he said, you know, they say what you love in the money will follow. He says, it's not literally true. He said, his favorite thing is to listen to Brahms symphonies. He says, there are Brahms symphonies. I've listened to a hundred times and I have yet to find anybody who will pay me a nickel to listen to Brahms symphonies. Brahms symphonies. So he says, think about this intersection. Think about where you are. Oh, and by the way, then he drew a little box around it and he said, then there's this other thing called who, right? He said, which is who you're going to work with? Who's on the bus with you? Because you can show up for work every day and you can do stuff you're good at and you can do stuff you're born to do. You can do stuff that people pay you to do. But if you're working with people that you hate or that hate you or that have no respect for you, still not going to be a happy camper, right? And so that's his kind of personal formula for this. And so he stopped speaking, as I will eventually here in a few minutes. And he stopped speaking and I'm no kidding. You talk for an hour and this is a small part of what he talked about, but 100% of the questions were about the three circles. In fact, 99% of the questions were about this circle here. What are you born to do? Because people kind of have a sense of what they're good at. It's pretty, there's a pretty efficient job market telling you what people will pay you to do. But what am I born to do? That's a much harder question. And Jim said, well, I can't answer that question for you, but I can answer it for me. He said, I was a kind of a nerdy kid. When I was a kid, I'd get out my magnifying glass and I would watch a bug. He says, and I get one of these old style laboratory notebooks and I write down my observations every day, I'd watch that bug and how does he eat and does he sleep and what's the bug doing all day. He admitted up front, he was a nerdy kid, right? Anyhow, so that's what he would do. And so he said, he found himself at this point in life he was working for a culot Packard, a great company, which he openly acknowledges, but he wasn't happy. And so he said, he got out one of those laboratory notebooks and he wrote on it a bug at the top and then he wrote a bug called Jim. And for two years, he kept a laboratory notebook on himself. It wasn't a journal. He wasn't writing down the occurrences of the day. He wrote down during the day, during each day for two years, when did I feel it my best? When was I in a state of flow? When did I feel the happiest? Because that's really important. And he said, it took him two years of discovery. This is the tortoise mind again. It took him two years of discovery, but he eventually figured out he was happiest when he was teaching and when he was working on systems. Things with lots of little complexity and moving part. And he said, figured out, I should be teaching about systems. And so he did. And I think he taught about systems at Stanford for a while as well until he found another calling. But he kept a lab notebook on himself. And so I've actually made this suggestion to somebody who's very near and dear to me. And that person followed this advice and got some value on it. And so if you're wondering, if you're drawn those three circles in your head and you're wondering, what am I born to do? I'd encourage you to try this lab notebook. It's an experiment, right? It can't hurt. So on this thing about following your passions, I think the definitive word comes to this British historian, Arnold Toinb, who says, the supreme achievement in life is the blur of the line between work and play. And that is what I try to do at I do. That's what I think a lot of my colleagues do is, I can tell that's what Tina Sealy does. Blur the line between work and play where you say, wait, are we working here or not? I lost track. And if I could pay to do this, this is pretty good. And so that's what you want to seek out. If you can follow your passions, if you can blur that line between work and play, that is almost the formula for a great life. So look, there are five of these. Seven plus or minus two, there are five ideas, five habits, five things that you can do. And so that's what I think a lot of people think about is, I think, like a traveler, turn up that piece of your brain so that you can do those observations all the time so that you can be the person who develops this deep and up to date knowledge of what's happening around you. There's the second one, it was, treat life as an experiment, be willing to fail a little bit, be willing to, you know, as long as there's learning attached, be willing to have some things not go as well, be willing to look a little silly in front of your peers, one of the nurtured and attitud of wisdom is Bob Sutton would just do that thing about having confidence, but distressing your knowledge just enough to keep searching. That's number three. Number four was use your whole brain and your tortoise mind, the tortoise mind being to me the more interesting of the two in certain ways because most people are conscious of this left brain, right brain thing, and then five, follow your passions, try to blur the line between work and play. And if you can do those things, if you can develop these five habits, if you can, you know, get a kind of an innovation momentum going, then you can nurture and build and reinforce your own creativity and you can stay young at heart and be an innovator for life. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. So as part of that experiment where I went through material for the first time, I talked slightly longer than I was supposed to and so we have a whopping three minutes for questions. I'll be around afterwards, signing books and things if you had a question. So there's a question there in the back and our microphone up here, I think you can either shout it out or approach that mic. Okay, it's a stupid question. These are the best kind. Treat life as an experiment. Do you have a blue stripe in all your presentation slides? Okay, the question is, why is there a blue stripe in my audio, in my visual presentation? This is really important. We've got to the heart of the matter here. And the answer is, when I made this, this one is missing the blue stripe at the top, so when I made this presentation a long time ago, so this is all graphic design by Tom Kelly. There was this point of view that said that remember TVs, the old ones, the CRT based TVs, that a squareish TV was old and assumed to be outdated. Whereas all the cool flat panel high definition TVs were more stretched, had an aspect ratio for the graphic designers and engineers and there was much wider. So this was cool and this was old fashioned. And so following that basic thought, I wanted mine to be cool and distinctive from, because people get tired of PowerPoint, right? It is actually the software underlying this presentation. I wanted to seem fresher and newer and so lacking the full complement of graphic design skills, I just stuck with that template. So glad we got that one out of the way. So anybody want to talk about design or innovation or creativity or any of those? A question? What's the coolest thing you ever designed for these? Oh, what's the coolest thing we ever designed? So as Tina said, we're off onto designing experiences now, but if we stick with products, coolest thing we ever designed is the answer, right? Because we did all, we made all these billions of dollars for people, you know, the Crest Meat Squeeze toothpaste tube of Palm Five, fabulously profitable products. But my favorite by far is called the Heartstream Defibrillator. We're all, I know there's one out in the lobby of this building. Heartstream defibrillator is this technology that used to be on a giant cart that sold for $60,000 and was used in the operating room, right? Or in the emergency room, and you've all seen this on TV. It's when they put the metal plates on the person's chest and they, you're like this, you know, it bounces them of this. Shock is so big it bounces them off the table, right? And our client, it was a startup company in Seattle, came up with a way to shrink that down and make it cheaper so that it could be in a police car. So you could have one in the lobby of the building and stuff like that, except it needed an interface. It needed a way so that someone completely untrained, you know, it's a flight attendant, and some were working on a train station could use it. And we made this interface so incredibly dirt simple. It's got a big one and a big two and a big three that with my daughter, Maya, was six years old, six years old, never showed her any instruction of any kind. I handed her this thing. Oh, I disabled the shock. The parents in the room are worried about that. I handed this and said, Maya, see if you can make this work. And I swear to God, my six year old daughter could have saved a life if anybody had letter at the time. So, wow, you make it so a six year old girl can operate it, you know, without instructions, that's pretty good. And so I am certain, we've said, well, the product has saved many hundreds of lives. And I'm certain there are people walking around alive today who would otherwise be dead because that interface is so simple. You go in a cardiac arrest, you got six minutes maximum to live, right? And so any kind of fumbling, any kind of reading instructions, even opening the unit, we have designed it, it's like a laptop and people fumble with that darn latch. And the designers behind the screen saying, you stupid user, you know, it's just a button, I'll just open it up. But the anthropologist is saying, hey, must make it simpler, gotta save those lives. And so easy question, heart soon to fibrelator. Toughest design project. We are working on a project now that I think falls into the category called Wicked Projects as in impossible, but since the client still under wraps, I can't talk about it. So sorry about that. Toughest. Toughest. You know, the American Red Cross one was quite challenging because there aren't many things like this in the world, let alone in America, in which, you know, we, all of us, you know, Stanford Hospital, you know, finest hospitals in America is right next to us. But if you go into Stanford Hospital and you need blood, you know, you need a transfusion, you are entirely dependent on the goodwill of others to donate that blood. And not just to donate it, once in a while, but donate it in a continuous basis in a way that we can maintain our inventory levels. And so that was quite a challenging project. And we think we have some ideas, it's not fully proven out, it's not fully implemented yet. So there's this pretty radical idea about focusing on the donor instead of focusing on the recipient that we think might bear fruit. What do you think those companies do use personal individuals to be much more innovative? Are they changed about themselves once they are in thousands of people? Are they afraid of their business? Sure. Okay, so question is, how do companies get more innovative? And wow, now we're on a topic I know about, right? So I've written two books on that subject exactly. And so I could say just by example, two of the companies that I've seen the biggest changing in my whole career were Samsung and Procterine Gamble. And there was a series of things that both had charismatic leaders. Both had this momentous change and they said, okay, must fix this, right? But in both cases, a whole series of things, it's Samsung, those radical ideas, let's have the older people listen to the younger people just a little bit. As far as I know that it never happened in the history of Samsung before, it was a very autocratic organization. But they also set up, they set up design centers around the world because they wanted this antennae they call them, you know, intended to bring in new learning. And Procterine Gamble, it's a series of things, it's a culture of brainstorming, it's more than anything, it's this idea about humility. It's this idea that we don't have to have all the solutions when AG Laughley, their great CEO, came into power. He said, look, I want you to switch from being problem solvers to being solution finders. You can imagine is R&D team at the time said, yeah, okay boss, the new speak, stop saying problem solvers, start saying solution, but they thought it was all semantics. But in fact, it was a sea change for the company because it was a company with great pride, great R&D team. And up until then, they thought no matter what the challenge, they had to build it themselves. Because we have the best chemist, we have the smartest people on the planet is what they're thinking. And they do have very bright people. But when they switched to this solution finder mode, what they said was it would be foolish for us to try to solve this problem ourselves. If somebody else, if a PhD student in Jakarta has been working on this for seven years, we want to start with what they know. We want to license it, we want to buy it, we want to hire that person, we want to tap into that knowledge. And so right now, you get no extra credit for developing a solution yourselves. You get extra credit for finding it somewhere in the world and bringing it in. And so there's this whole language in companies about not embedded here and it just went completely away at Procter & Gamble. You can't even voice that idea. Because your friends will say you didn't get the memo, right? The CEO said he wants at least 50% of the ideas come to the outside and it has opened up their company. You can see it in the rate of new product introduction. You can see it in the culture of the company because they made that change. So but two books, I recommend the second one if you want to go into that. Thank you. All right. So on behalf of Basis and STVP, thank you very much Tom for your participation. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
