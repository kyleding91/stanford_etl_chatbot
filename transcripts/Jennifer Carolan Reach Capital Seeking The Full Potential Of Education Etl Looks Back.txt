 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. So it is my pleasure to welcome General for Carolyn to ETL today. An experienced teacher and education researcher, Jennifer now serves as managing director of the new school seed fund, which she co-founded to make investments in early stage ed tech companies with a potential for big impact in K through 12 education. To lead us in exploring Jennifer's insights in this area and to discuss maybe what it means to be part of a nonprofit venture philanthropy fund, I'm also privileged to welcome serial entrepreneur and our own Stanford Engineering Consulting Associate Professor Steve Blank. Please help me welcome Jennifer and Steve up for ETL. Hey Jennifer. Hey Steve. How are you? Good. Great. Honored to be here. So Jennifer, we met a long time ago and I thought maybe we'd start by you maybe telling everybody how high were we when we met. And so you're going what? I will go there. I'm questioning is that right? Do you remember how high we were? We were 11,000 feet. We were at 11,000 feet. Make sure you note that to your parents. Okay. Where were we and when was it? I actually don't remember the year but it was in Yosemite backcountry, high Sierra camps. It was. We were hiking across the high Sierra camps and I just would like everybody in their audience to know. Jennifer was the first person ever to see drawn in the sand. The beginnings of the lean startup when I was trying to explain it to anybody who would pass by including these random people I didn't know. I was drawing it in the dirt with a stick and in fact it was you and your husband who in fact renamed it from market development to customer development. So we've known each other for a while but you've had a really interesting career. You know you were a teacher for seven years right and then you came back to Stanford and got your MA in teacher and curriculum development and then you went off and joined the seat fund for education. What was that connection? How does MA end up as a venture capital? Yeah. Well so on that just a note on where we met in Yosemite, I'm pretty certain that I wouldn't be doing this job today if we hadn't literally crossed paths in the backcountry of Yosemite and you were on your mules. He had his two daughters with him and they were like you guys literally were on mules. And we were hiking in the backcountry. Because people have called me an ass before. So it was very appropriate. And it was my first kind of real exposure to the concepts of customer development and entrepreneurship. So it really sparked something in me and that experience. But to your question about how I ended up here, yeah a lot of people ask how does a teacher end up running a venture philanthropy fund. And I had taught for seven years, loved teaching but felt I had plateaued and really wasn't meeting the needs of my students. Oh my goodness. I was teaching US history in the last year. I actually taught teachers differentiated instruction. And for what age? Middle school and high school. Okay. So I felt like I had plateaued a bit, decided to go to grad school, came to Stanford, got my master's and curriculum and teacher development. And I started hanging out a little bit at the business school and I saw Kim Smith speak. And she was the founder of New Schools Venture Fund. And she talked about this idea of hybrid teams bringing educators together with MBAs and entrepreneurial people and people that had more of a business and technical background. And I was really taken with her vision of there's a place for me in this world of entrepreneurship. So begged her for a job. She hired me on as a part time research assistant. And I worked there for, I've been there, this is my ninth year actually. And so after my, so really kind of learned how to do this job by shadowing, you know, basically like apprenticeship, shadowing the partners at the time. I had great mentors. And then three years, three years ago, my friend and I way, we actually launched this seed fund to formalize the structure of ed tech investing at New Schools. So, so once back up, you've raised some really interesting questions. One is this idea of Kim Smith had what, nine, ten years ago, or even further. That was something unique. I mean, what was the unique insight and what were people doing before and what changed after New Schools Ventures show? Sure. So she had this, so she founded New Schools with Brook Byers venture capitalist and John Doerr, another venture capitalist. And they came together and they thought, can we bring the venture model into education? And can we bring the kind of rigor and discipline of investing in early stage entrepreneurs and support them? But the difference between our model and a traditional venture fund is that we prioritize impact. So we are, we're looking for sustainable, scalable, strong businesses, companies. But we are above all else prioritizing impact. So that was the first difference. What does impact mean? Are you doing charter schools or software or future training? We have this belief that there is sort of no silver bullet for education. So the answer is not charters or ed tech or teacher development. That it's really a complex system that requires entrepreneurial energy across all of these different sectors. So we do invest grant money to nonprofit charter schools. We have close to 400 charter schools in our portfolio. Wow. Yeah, and we invest in teacher training programs. And then I focus on education technology investing through the seed fund. So really good. So the idea of the fund covers all these ways to change education. And what you're focusing on is tech. Is that the ed tech? Exactly. So. And so what's an ed tech? So we started investing in ed tech. So new schools was founded 16 years ago. And we started, our first investment was actually great schools, which is still around a really great company. And we have always invested in ed tech. But we started about three, four years ago. We started seeing some, some kind of differences out there in the funding environment. There was a lot more angel investing. And our schools were absorbing technology like never before. So we thought the time is right. Let's formalize this fund now. We moved our headquarter to our office to Palo Alto. And we started investing in seed stage ed tech. And I think ed tech is like a catch all for this intersection of education and technology companies. And it can be companies that are focused on students, that are focused on teachers. Most of our investing actually is targeted at teachers. And you said though that one of the goals of new schools was impact. Is that still true for the ed tech investing you make? Yeah, absolutely. Is it impact or is it profit or is it these five or once a non-profit? Yeah, so we have, so we're agnostic if it's non-profit or for profit. Okay. So new schools will say, what is the best way to get at the impact goals? Wait a minute. You're a venture fund that would fund a non-profit. I've sat on boards where I've decided they were non-profits. But that was by accident, not on purpose. So you actually fund them on purpose? We have some of those in our portfolio. But at least you could say, oh, we met you guys to be a non-profit. We actually have some more profits that are closer to non-profits. But you can make that decision on day one as a fund that these are something that's worth funding. Yeah, yeah. And I think that's what's unique about this space is that we have amazing non-profits in this space. Khan Academy, CK-12, read works that are strong, scalable, sustainable, non-profits. But we have them side by side top tier venture backed ed tech companies that we co-invest with. So we are, again, it goes back to this idea that there is no one single solution. It's a complex system that requires, we need hardware in the schools, but we also need software that teachers can use and the students can use. And these things work together. And we see, that's what I think is really unique about new schools, is that we see this whole system, we touch all different parts of it, and we can see where the needs are. So our fund is really need driven, thesis driven. So we ask our teachers, we ask our school leaders, you know, what's preventing you from, what's preventing your students from reaching high levels of student achievement. And then they will tell us, this is what we need. We need a better way for teachers to share lesson plans. We need a better way for students, for teachers to be trained on the spot. And we will go out looking for those solutions. So before we go through some of those solutions, which I want to hear about, you said something earlier that I thought was really interesting, is that the adoption of new technologies is accelerated in the last couple of years, in schools, is that true? Absolutely, yeah. And what is, what's driving that, or is it legislation, is it iPads, is it something, is it, it's now time, or the students have more tech than the schools? I mean, yeah, there's quite a few factors. I think one is that, I would say this ed tech revolution has been led by the teachers. And they are the ones adopting these solutions, bringing them into their classrooms and using them. That's a big idea. Why do you think that is? Well, 40% of US teachers, there's 4 million US teachers, are under the age of 30. So they're young. They've grown up with technology. I see. And this is the way, you know, they're banking online, they're shopping online, they come to school, and they get, you know, in most schools, this is what you get your file cabinet, your textbook, and your paper grater. And they're saying, you know, no way, we want technology tools that are as good as our consumer technology tools. So that's a big change, right? So teacher driven because the outside world for them is computerized, and they're going back into something that looks like the little house on the prairie school house. And what else? Any impact of legislation or no child left behind, or is that all orthogonal to what's driving them? No, it's not. You know what, actually, this is, three years ago when we started this fund, what was really a driver of the change was the budget cuts, actually. And the severity of the budget cuts, and they were faced with, do I, you know, you know, one of our schools that we funded, Kip LA, do we not open the school, or do we open it with more technology and a greater student teacher ratio? So that was, you know, it's been one driver of getting the technology into the schools. And then there is a lot more devices, right? Like there's nine million iPads in USK 12 schools. We have 2000 schools or one to one now, and we expect that number to be close to 100% of schools to be one to one, which is, I mean, one. Sorry, I fall into the education lingo, one device per child. Oh, real? I mean, they assigned somebody an iPad? Yeah, so when you register a school, you get your textbook, you get your iPad, you get your... And who pays for those devices? It varies. So sometimes the schools pay, sometimes the parents pay. Some of the funding for this is being covered by Title I funding for low income schools. That's really interesting. And has the entrepreneurs changed in the 16 years? Or are they the same? Are they motivations? Are they technology? Are they goals? Or are they the same that you've seen? Yeah, thankfully they've changed a lot. So, you know, I think that the technology used to come into schools. Innovation came, you know, with a car in a car. You know, so the salesperson would drive up and have some CD-ROMs and show the IT specialist. You know, there's Oregon Trailers or whatever the software was. And the IT specialist would purchase that technology with often without talking to teachers and without having any data on the efficacy of this product. And then they would roll it out to the teachers kind of, you know, top down, force teachers to use it. And that's the way technology was, was, was, was came to our schools in the 90s. But now, thankfully, the way it's happening is that these teachers are adopting the technology into their classroom. They're using it. They're understanding how it works with their students. They're getting efficacy data, doing kind of many research in their own classrooms. And then they will kind of pitch their school leader to purchase the software license. Wow, that's, that's a real shift. It's huge. It's like the difference between PCs entering the corporation versus mainframes being controlled by a single department and a CIO. Yeah, same ideas like consumerization of IT, right? It's a great insight. And, and but have the entrepreneurs themselves changed? I mean, do they all have the same vision that they had in the 90s? Or are they more savvy, less savvy, same problems, different problems? So, yeah, you saw two of them up there. I mean, I'm biased, of course, but I think, I think they're amazing. Like these, these entrepreneurs are, we have more entrepreneurs coming from engineering and from the consumer tech sector coming into education. So, the first guy that you saw. You mean, you don't stop them at the door and send them away. So, if there's some engineering students and some tech entrepreneurs, you'll let them actually go picture. No, we welcome them with open arms. We love them in education. Love them. So, the, the Krishna, he has students, he has students, he has children that are in school and he wanted his kids to, to be able to learn coding computer science early on. So, that's why he had built Tinker, but he had two successful companies in consumer tech prior. And he then decided to go into tech because he had kids. Yeah. Is that some kind of motivation for you? Absolutely, yeah. And roughly, across our portfolio, we have 46 ed tech companies in our portfolio and 45% of them have been founded by teachers. Interesting. So, tell me about the portfolio. And tell me about the types of deals you see. And in fact, let me ask the canonical question. How many deals do you look at or get pitched or get thrown over the transformer week in my tech? Yeah, so, I think we're really lucky because New Schools has been around for 16 years and has a name and presence in the space. So, we get 20 to 30 companies coming in our pipeline per week. A week. That's about a thousand to 1500 a year. Yeah. Do you read them all? No. Okay. Not anymore. So, what's the first, give me the characteristic for anybody watching or here? What is kind of a good first order pass for an ed tech deal to be looked at for you and new schools? So, like the space or the... Both the space and the entrepreneur and then how do they then will ask, you know, what's your email address so they can email you personally. But no, we won't get that. My email's on like 10. It is open. It's out there. But first of all the space, what are you currently looking at? How do you sort through the thousand to 1500 as a venture capitalist, but a venture capitalist and a very specialized niche? Yeah. What should people be watching or listening think about when they're thinking about pitching a deal? Sure. So, we focus on K-12 first. So, education market covers kind of pre-K through higher ed. We focus on K-12. And then we were thesis driven. So, we've identified some of these problems, which I mentioned earlier. What are they again? Yeah. So, these are problems most identified by our schools that we are investing around. But I also want to say that we are not dogmatic about following our investment areas. Because I'm continually surprised by the entrepreneurs that come through our doors and show us what they are doing with technology. And that is, you know, so we're open to breakthrough innovations that entrepreneurs bring us. But what are the thesis? Okay. So, these are, I think first is that we focus on underserved populations. So, we are looking at companies that are going to service special education students, English language learning students, first generation college, going students. So, these are areas that have been terribly underserved in the past. So, the tools that teachers have in these areas which are heavily compliance driven are just terrible. So, we are looking for innovation in those sectors. Give us some examples. Okay. So, actually our first investment out of the seed fund was a company called Goldbook. And this guy is amazing, Daniel Yu. And he was a Oracle coder developer. And then he became a special education teacher in Ravenswood. So, we had this really unique mix of engineer and teacher. And so, he had coded up a solution for teachers to create individualized education plan goals for their students. So, in a few years special education child, you have these IEP goals. And there are goals that the teachers and the parents and all the people that are supporting that child are working towards. So, he automated the process. Exactly. So, he automated that process. But he also brought great research into it. So, he infused this research coming out of Boston into the goal making. So, that's an example. One thesis, special education in the serve community. Next thesis. So, another thesis is tools to help teachers differentiate learning. What is happening? It sounds like an education for me. Yeah. So, differentiation is actually the number one topic of professional development requested by teachers and has been since the early 90s. So, basically the idea is that our school system is one size fits all. That we are in a mass production, school system. We kind of batch kids through our school system which worked really well when we were preparing kids for factories during the industrial age. But now we have demands of a very high skill economy and that does not work anymore. So, the idea is we are moving closer to personalize learning. And differentiation is a set of strategies that a teacher would use to help personalize instruction for children. So, instead of breaking them in separate classes, it's how does one teacher actually personalize the content for mixed learning. Exactly. So, that's learners. So, just give you a real quick example on that one. There's a company we fund called NewsElla. And they bring current events into the classroom. So, they have partnerships with like New York Times and Washington Post. And they bring great journalism into the classroom. But they level it. Five different Lexile reading levels for students. You'll ask me. You may do one. So, they level the article. So, there's an article that you're getting from New York Times. They kind of rank the complexity of the ground. Exactly. So, there's actually a standard Lexile. It's called. And you can level any text for different reading abilities. So, the idea is that all students in the class can engage in the same article. Whereas before, you know, they would split kids up. And then you'd have, you know, names like, this is the Bluebird group. And they're reading like really interesting text. And then you have the, you know, buzzards that are reading, you know, see Spot Run. Because they're struggling readers. And it's very stigmatizing to kids. And the idea now is that you can engage in the same article. And then they can have a discussion around it. So, that's another thesis. Yeah. Yeah. So, that's a differentiating instruction. Then we're really focused on STEM. Science, technology, engineering, and math. So, we're trying to build the STEM pipeline. For K through 12. Yeah. And exam. Tinker was one of them. Yeah. A coding. We have three coding companies in our portfolio. Tinker, code HS. And code now, which is a nonprofit. Got it. Another thesis? Or is that the other one? So, then we have underserved STEM. We do a lot of digital, oh, big data. Big data is a, actually, really important one. So, this is basically tools that extract data from students, student learning. And provide a really nice visual dashboard for teachers or decision makers that are making decisions about a child's placement or even like what they're going to learn tomorrow. And we have four or five companies in that portfolio. So, this is decision management for administrators and teachers. Exactly. Be more effective about utilization of teaching resources. Yeah. Okay. And so, with those kind of the general. Yeah. So, how many companies a year do you fund? So, we fund 12 to 14 companies. So, let's say, let me do the math. That's about 100 to 1. Yeah. Right. So, for every 100. Plans, you see, you fund one. Yeah. Right. So, I see somebody in the back writing up 100 plans right now. Right. So, you, you, and what's the filter? How do you kind of decide? I mean, how do they get, is it personal introductions? Or what's the best way for your fund to connect to an entrepreneur? So, there is, there's easy ways to reach anyone in new schools. You can, we do have, my email is unlinked in and available. And people do email us directly. I get at least one or two per day from entrepreneurs. Do you have a fund any of those? We have funded one. One. Okay. So, what's the more effective way? That's spam, you know. It's a really awesome company. Brightfights. And MIT guys. So, you've never knew them before. So, cold email? He was just cold email. So, one out of a couple hundred. But what's the other way that they, she get all of your fund? So, usually they come in through warm introduction, through, so entrepreneurs are great pipeline of referrals of companies. So, they should be spamming your portfolio, right? That is. Right. For an intro. Is that what you're suggesting? Is that what they should be meeting the CEO? That is one way. Yes. And so, but that's just a natural way that venture capitalists tend to feel. I mean, it's not that different, I guess, than other venture capitalists. It's that, if someone vouches for someone that says this is an interesting company, this is a great entrepreneur. Yeah, you listen up. Yeah, exactly. I mean, we really do try to be open because we believe that, you know, especially in education, some of these great ideas are coming from teachers that are twilling away in their classrooms and building solutions. And they may not be connected to anyone in Silicon Valley. So, we want to find them too. So, the standard model for, certainly here at Stanford, and if somebody's, you know, watching online or listening to podcasts is, you know, everything needs to be a billion dollar company. Is that the goal of these EdTech companies? If they need to come in and prove to you that they're going to get 20 million students in year one, and then, was there a different model for what you saw? Yeah, I know. So, because we prioritize impact, we're not looking for... So, say that part again. Because we prioritize impact. Big deal. So, you're not looking for the little graph that looks exponential like Facebook, though you wouldn't throw them out. Right, right. There's some, you know, there's a reason why that data is going up into the right, and so we want to understand why. But, I actually looked this up just today that there's been 11 EdTech companies since, I think it was 1998, that are considered like EdTech Unicorns, billion dollar valuations. But that's not what you're looking for. And so, what do you look for when they talk about, you know, scale and business or whatever? So, besides a great idea, and you think it's interesting, what are the other things you're kind of filtering out? Yeah, I think that, you know, this is one of the things that we have gotten... We make a lot of mistakes, too, I should say, that like, I don't feel like I have, you know, some magic, you know, seen to the future that all these companies are going to be successful. Are you sure you're a venture capital? I mean, we are coming in at the earliest stages when there... These ideas are raw, like, many times they are just a feature, they're an idea, they're... Because it's a seed fund. We're at the top of the funnel, it's a seed fund. So, we're doing a lot... So, I think the most important thing that we're looking for is authenticity. So, is this person authentically driven to solve a problem? And that authenticity could look lots of different ways, right? Like, it could be a teacher that was like Daniel, that was, you know, face the problem in his classroom, and so he built a solution for it. We have a great company called No Red Ink. This teacher in Chicago, actually, he was at a Chicago Public High School, and he was tired of grading papers. And so, he found a developer on Craig's list, and he actually created this solution, No Red Ink. So, you know, he was very authentic. Like, he was a guy that's just like driven to solve a problem. So, we are looking for what is driving them to start this company. And so, we're looking for authenticity, and then we're looking for courage to, like, starting a company as you know, Steve, intimately, that it takes a lot of courage and a lot of going... Or stupidity, one of the two, right? We're looking for the courage side of that spectrum. So, I never would have gotten funded. And so, courage, authenticity, and then... And then, it's on the specific theme. Kind of aligned to one of those themes. And do you give them some examples? Is there stuff on your website they should look at? We've linked to SteepLink.com. I was thinking about... is it listed your portfolio companies up there? Yeah, yeah. And so, what mistakes do the people you fund in ATEC? Not just the ones to get into you, but the ones that actually are funded. Do you see some common mistakes of entrepreneurs? What we do... This is an interesting one, because I think it's two sides of the same coin. We see companies that don't think of themselves as technology companies. So, they think of themselves as an education company. They have a lot of great former teachers that are starting this company. But then I say, you know, where's your tech team? Where's your developers? And I say, oh, you know, we outsource that to wherever. And we built our product. And we're going to sell it. And, you know, that is sort of a red flag to us, because that harkens back to the technology of ATEC of the 90s, where they build this product, and then they just blow up this huge sales force and just go sell it to schools. And then the product... And what's wrong with that? Well, the product wouldn't have... Literally, like, would go, you know, 10 years and not be changed. And not be improved. And they can't respond to user needs. And they're not getting out of the building and talking to their teachers. So you want to see a whole team of both... So I want to see a hybrid team of educators and technologists. What other mistakes do you see in that tech? Yeah, so on the flip side of that is sometimes we see heavy technology teams that don't have any educators in the leadership team. And I see, you know, those are problematic, too, because I think it is really beneficial to have somebody that understands schools and education deeply to be helping guide the company. And then I'd say, like, maybe one other big, big mistake companies make is that they... Because there's so many teachers adopting these products, and they are the ones that are really driving the attraction, that they build this product for the teacher, but then forget that the payer is the administrator, and that there's a whole different set of processes and needs that administrators have. So that's interesting. So you mean they kind of confuse that there might be a multi-sided market and dealing with users and payers? Yeah. And that they might actually know that the users are passionate, but they might as well be a non-profit, because the payers don't care, is that? Yeah, I would characterize it like that. Yeah, there's a lot of companies that have figured this out and have done a really amazing job of capitalizing on this, like, user base. And actually using these teachers to kind of upsell to principals and administrators, I think Wiki Spaces has done a really good job. But as your point, that should be a strategy, not an accident. Yes, yeah, exactly. And without naming names, are there some spectacular failures that you now kind of think back to, and everybody likes the barrier they're dead and leave them dead? But you wish you knew what you now know about, I should have seen these happen in that kind of education specific. Yeah, definitely. I've got some of those in our portfolio. But there's one that I think that really frustrates me that we invest in this company, because this is one of those, I've mentioned, you learn this job by doing. You learn it by making mistakes, and you learn it by seeing lots of companies and by actually doing the work. And this one company that we invested in, this is early on, the cap table, I sort of didn't look at closely enough. Cap table, who? The capitalization table that basically says who owns the company, you know, how the shares are divided. And what I didn't realize is that the founder, his share of the company was actually like super small. And he'd come out of this incubator, this accelerator, that owned most of the equity of the company. So he basically felt like, you know, hired help to run this company. And it played out that way, so. So what would you do different now, or what do you do different? I look very closely at the cap table. I try to understand who all those people are, and cousins, and uncles, on the cap table. And then I think goes back to like data, like pattern recognition, you get better at looking for that authenticity in the entrepreneur. So you want the founder engaged and the ability to go. This has got to be his heat, or she, they're going to create this company, whether without us, no matter what, they feel strong conviction for this company. So that's what, you know, it's one of the most important things that we look for. Good. And any other lessons that were expensive or interesting? They're ongoing, so many. You know, yeah, I think there's another one that I learned that is, that I sort of projected my vision for a company onto this company. And I was so excited about this vision, and it was really like, when I think about it, it was my vision. It was not this founder's vision. And so we just sort of had, there was a lot of friction there. Direction that company should go. And let me just kind of close this with trying to understand the context of your fund in the funding ecosystem. You're a seed fund, right? And that implies what, and for additional funding, where do you fit, and what happens in a successful payment? Successful path for it. Yeah, so we're very active ed tech seed funds. So we were the number one most active ed tech funder the last two years. So what does seed mean? So generally it means first money in. Sometimes it's after an accelerator and incubator. So we are pre-series A investor. And is that like $5,000 or $500,000? So our ticket size is usually like 150 to 200,000? So ticket size is that, if you speak for something, is that? Investment. Investment is how much? 150 to 200,000. So that is a seed round enough to get you started. And what do you expect them to do without money? We co-invest with other angels. I see. So how much is the pool? This is interesting. So when we first started the seed fund, average seed rounds were about 750 in ed tech. And now they're about 1.5 million. And what do you expect a startup to do with a $1.5 million seed round? So our company is we bucket them into three categories. And one is you're going to get to sustainability on your seed round alone. So goal book is a company that achieved profitability on a million dollars. So sustainability means make more money than you're spending. Yeah. That's bucket one. Second bucket would be you're a good candidate for foundation or other type of impact financing for follow on. So you're not VC profile. But there may be impact investors like Gates or Gates Foundation. There's a lot of angel investors that are interested in impact. And then the third is you're getting ready for VC round of financing. And a VC is actually interested in the space? Yeah, very, very much so. So last year there was 452 million invested in K12 ed tech. In one company? Across a number of different companies. But yeah, there's like Bessamurizen, Client or Perkins. We've co-invested with Excel as in two of our companies. So yeah, there's quite a few. Great. And so they go then down the traditional venture path. Yes. How interesting. And so what would you tell entrepreneurs who were interested in ed tech today? What should they do? Or why should anybody be interested in ed tech? Those who haven't even given much thought about this area? Yeah, I think that this is such an important sector, such an important area, as all of us sitting here at Stanford know, that we have our education system is really suffering right now, especially for the low income students. So in our country that if your parents did not graduate from high school, then the chances are that you will get to college and get through college, or about 5%, and in other industrialized countries that's 23%. So education, which used to be this amazing escalator of opportunity for people in the United States, especially those in lower income people, it's not the case anymore. And yeah, there's lots of stats that I can tell you around that. But I think it's ripe for innovation, and the time is now to be building ed tech companies. So is the way to think about this is if there's more to life than 140 characters, you should be thinking about giving back and ed tech. Yeah. I mean, there's nothing wrong with social media, but this actually affects people's lives a little differently than other things you could be doing with your time. And by the way, you mentioned US, is that where your funding is, is the focus on just US ed tech companies? You know, we're being drawn more and more outside the US, but we've invested into Canadian companies. And we are across the portfolio, about 15% of users that are using the companies that products are outside of the US. Will you look at deals outside of it? Yes, definitely. And so you seem to be like committed to this. Yeah. And why? Personally. Yeah. I mean, you now have enough, you know, like points in the game to kind of go to any venture. Why are you doing this one? You know, I think if I sort of play armchair psychologists with myself and think, why am I drawn to this space? I think it goes back to, I grew up in outside of Chicago. And I grew up in a suburb, Glen Ellen. And it was a western suburb in very middle class community. And my sophomore year, we moved into the city. And I went to Chicago Public High School. And it was just, you know, just vastly different experience in the quality of education. Better work. A lot worse, a lot worse. So long-term subs, just the teachers were not high quality. Just the opportunity that was offered to the kids is not the same. So we moved back the following year into the suburbs. But I consider that year like a real gift in my life. And understanding that opportunity is so important for people. And schools, our education institutions are incredibly important to make that opportunity happen. So I think human potential is everywhere. It's not just in Palo Alto and Silicon Valley. And we need to make sure that we have schools that can really tap into people's potential. So it sounds like you're in a mission. Could say that. So is there anything I should have asked you? What question do you wish I would have asked? No, we can maybe open it up to this. We will, but no, no, no. You're blushing already. So there must be a question. You're either happy I didn't ask. Or you wish I did. I think maybe the path may sound like it's been easy. I was a teacher and then I popped into Seek Him Smith. And then I went to new schools. And now I'm investing in education. But it's been steep and long learning curve for me. And when I came into new schools, I was a researcher. And I didn't have an MBA now. Surrounded by these Harvard and Stanford MBAs who would talk about leverage and value proposition and level five leadership and all of this fancy MBA talk. And I was so intimidated by this. They didn't know what it meant to you. But now I use that. Now I'll drop leverage a couple times a day now. A couple more times this talk. So I think that I was, and I did feel when I first started at new schools I have this my ninth year, like very intimidated by that. And I guess like if I could give, you guys don't need advice. But if I could offer something that I took away from this experience is that to value what you bring to the table and value your skills and what your experience and what you have done. Because I feel like I undervalued my education experience. I was the only teacher at new schools at the time that you know had taught more than two years. That was a non-TFA teacher. And I didn't, I feel like I didn't, didn't, I didn't value that enough in myself. And it turned out you were the only one who I knew anything. You could have helped it. So I think that's a, that's is a great way to kind of end the conversation. But I want to thank you for your time and I learned a lot. And so thank you Jennifer. So you want to take some questions on the audience. So questions? Do we have a mic or we're going to just do this? If you could repeat the question. And working in the field, how have you seen companies looking towards making their product have a large impact because technology is so expensive? Have they been in the innovative ways that they look towards getting us across the wide breadth of people in the schools that don't have the private school or charter school funding? Yeah. Okay. The question was how can you grow your company inexpensively? Is that right? Well, so now things have changed and there's great ways distribution channels into schools. So we have the App Store, which teachers use. On the iPads, there's 9 million iPads in our schools. We have the Google Chromebooks, the Google Play for Education Store. There's a Moto App Store. So I think that that is a good first sort of first line of getting your app out there and seeing. Getting your feedback and growing from there. I mean, I'm amazed actually that some of these companies they put their app up there and they grow like Class Dojo. This is a fantastic company. Class Dojo spent zero dollars in marketing and grew to 45 million students. Just through the App Store? Yeah. And having like a, they have a blog and they have some social media presence but mainly through these things. And the other thing is that teachers love to tell each other about great products and they will. And so there's a natural virality in education. Okay. Right there. Do you find any mental health or emotional health companies related to students? The question is social emotional learning or social emotional health? Social health, emotional learning. Yeah. We are looking into that more and more actually. We're doing diligence on a company right now in that space. So I think it's really important and we know that those qualities are predictive of student success in lots of different ways. So yeah, there's more and more companies out there in the space. Okay. Next. Yeah. How do you justify to your clients investing in nonprofits? And also can you give us some examples of ways to measure your impact? Sure. So the questions, how do we justify nonprofits, investment in nonprofits? Yeah, it's a good question. So we have invested or granted money, I should say, out of the seed fund to six nonprofits. And because we do not provide returns back to our limited partners. So the money that comes into us to invest is a philanthropic capital, it's donations. So you use the profits to kind of evergreen the fund, reinvest in more companies. Exactly. So we've had several exits, some recently, N-grade. We had this year, wireless generation, Carnegie learning, blend space. And profits from those returns are recycled back into the fund, which we then happily invest in other entrepreneurs. But you had a second question. Oh, how do we measure impact? Lots of different ways. So we care about, we collect metrics from our companies every quarter. And we care about retention. And retention is very important for us. Our teachers using these products. We measure net promoter scores of the products. We look at student achievement gains when we can. Next question. Yeah. Just out of curiosity. I just wanted to do you ever take input from different education models in different countries? Of course. Yeah. So the question is, do we look at other education models in other parts of the world? And take that into account when we're thinking about our investments? No, inter-year-old. And you compare it to China? Yeah, I was in China two years ago visiting the schools in Chengdu. So we do, we do, we should do more of it, but we do look at other models. And we certainly look at the international rankings of schools, student achievement across the country. Okay. Other questions? How come this side of the room hasn't asked anything? Are you guys like all in detention and school? There we go. All right. This is kind of close to that side. Yes. What's your things, would you like to see assuming you had like any power in Congress in terms of education reform based on your own experience? Yeah. It's a good question. What was the question? The question is if we had endless bank account to change education or to reform education, what would we do? I think I would want to move us away from this system that is based on essentially seat time. So you kind of move through the system, grade by grade, and move it to a mastery based system so that it's based on your mastering different concepts. And you're moving more fluidly through the system. I think it's this system that we have right now based on seat time is very constraining to schools. Same by, we run that experiment. Yeah, there are schools that are doing mastery based learning. Where you can spend variable time in the school? Well, you kind of work through a set of objectives at your own pace, right? So if you like finish it fast, you're out. And if you're not that fast, you're still there. Yeah, I'm not sure what happens when you finish all of the objectives if you're actually out. But there's schools in Alaska that I know they're doing a lot of work in that front. And there's lots of schools around here too that are more tech enabled. I think that's a big one. The way that teachers are trained and the way that teachers are, like I was, I went to the school of education. And if you go into that coverly library, you see that all of these like research journals, hundreds of research journals, which essentially hold all the secrets to how we best teach kids. And those are inaccessible to teachers that are in the classrooms teaching students. It's just ridiculous in this day and age of technology that teachers are not given access to the latest research. And how best to teach students. Sounds like a start up in there. Yes. We'll find that. We'll find that one right there. Anybody else? Yes. I was just curious. What is your firm specific goals? You talked about master education and how is it curious? What else would you like to see? What animals do you want to see if you're in the student of the United States of Education systems? What are our firm's goals? What are new schools' goals? Our mission is to transform public education through passionate ideas, powerful ideas, and passionate entrepreneurs, especially for the most underserved kids. And so we are really focused on this achievement gap, which has gotten worse and worse over time. So since the 1960s, there has been the gap between affluent and poor students has grown by 40 points. And now it has doubled that of the achievement gap between black and white. So you know, you say that last part again. So class is now more important than race. Absolutely. In the US educational equipment. Yes. Yes. And the research has been done by children. Well, you ought to like think about that for a second. But the research has been done by professor at Stanford, Sean Reardon. And yeah, it is more of a predictor now. That class is more important than race in educational success. The predictor of educational success is in the middle. Which also is the predictor of income. Yes. And what is scary is that now 48% of students in our nation's public schools are eligible for free and reduced lunch. So almost half of our kids and its majority in some areas of the South are eligible for free and reduced lunch. Which is a proxy for low income. Yeah. Those race in class are not necessarily mutually exclusive. That's right. One can define other ones. Does that see some information telling you? Yeah. I mean, you can see that there's a great piece in the New York Times about this actually. That talks about has a bunch of graphs. A lot of what? Oh, was race and income are not mutually exclusive. Yes. But they're not completely overlapping either. Right. That's the surprise. Other questions. Ah. That's like, you get to ask two because you're representing the entire side of that auditorium. Yeah, just believe what you mentioned about goals. Would you be supportive of goals that, you know, such as like online education, replacing physicality in schools altogether. Would you be supportive or would you endorse those goals? Like, you know, I complete my entire high school requirements online or my university requirements online. And save on so much money building physical school and things. And would you be supportive of those goals? Yeah. It's a good question. So the question is, would we be supportive of... Virtual. 100% yeah, 100% online education virtual schools. So it's an area that we're looking into quite a bit now because it's the fastest growing subpopulation of schools in the US now. And it's growing 11, the best research that I have tapped into is 11%. It grew last year and it's growing almost twice as fast as charter schools. So it is a very important sector to think about. We have not made many investments in that... Any investments actually in that space. We have made space investments in blended learning models that are still focused on teachers being the coordinator of learning in the classroom. But, you know, there are a lot of... Just to be honest here, there's a lot of bad providers in that virtual learning space, k12.com. It's one of them, it's a billion dollar company. And we would love to see some disruption of the dominant players in that space. And why are they not optimal? Their results are bad. Their results around helping students learn when you look at student achievement results are not good. Then why are they dominant? I think that there's... they're the market leader and there's so few alternatives right now. And kids are opting out of the traditional school system and are going totally online. So it sounds like you're asking for some business plans in this area? Yeah, yeah. That would be looked at kindly if people were facing you those ideas. It's a hard space to get into because you have to create a very comprehensive product. It's not like some of the other products that you can kind of wedge into with a little product, a little MVP. Like you actually really need a comprehensive soup to nuts product that you're providing. And that's difficult to create. So we have time for one or two best questions. Okay. All the way back. I'm not a expert at the guy. Yeah, he is. Yeah, smack him. He will get her after you. Unless you're related to him. Then smack him twice. How do you make the investment in a company? What is your relationship with that look like? How long have they remained in the portfolio? How do you continue to support the founders? Yeah, it's a good question. One question is once we make the investment, how do we support these companies? So we believe that we have a hands-on role with these companies after we've invested in them. And so they don't necessarily have a board. Most of them don't have a board. I am on seven boards, though, of companies that have now grown up and have raised their series A and invited me to the board. We have a set of supports that we provide. Actually, our director of portfolio supports is here. She's in the back, Eva. And we have some kind of scalable supports. So we have great strategic partnerships with Google and Apple and Modo that we're able to support our companies through. There's a lot of kind of interportfolio convenings that we do. We bring up portfolio together. They share best practices with each other. We do a lot of, you know, I'm constantly texting and talking with our companies on different problems that they're having. So we support them in very kind of traditional ways that a seed fund would. But I think that we bring in education lens and we have a great network in the education space. And we have almost 400 schools that we are close to. And I've seen this as an amazing interaction support. We have it at Steedown. Who has a quick best question? Quick best question. Right there. So, in the last few years, there's been a lot of concern about the costs of technology in terms of short of attention, spans and distractability. There's actually an interesting question. Not the lecture. What's the question? In the New York Times thing. What's the question? There's a question. We're running out of time. What's the question? What's your opinion on the downside of technology? Particularly in light of like all school children being treated. Okay. Okay. So, question was like, what are the downsides of tech? So, we have focused our investing on schools, institutions and really focused on teachers. So, we haven't had, I don't mean to dodge the question, but we haven't really had to deal with the early, the very earliest ages, you know, zero through five of children using technology. And there's definitely more and more research out there. There's recommendations from the American Pediatric Association about screen time and things like that. But, you know, I have three kids of my own and I can tell you that this is really hard. Like, we vacillate between, you know, giving our kids iPads so we can get something done to, you know, to like banning technology for, you know, months on end. I think it's, I think it's, I think we really got to get better at figuring out what is the balance of the technology in the classroom. So, Jennifer, thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks very much.
