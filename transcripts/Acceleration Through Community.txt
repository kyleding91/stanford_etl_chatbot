 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Today we have a really fascinating panel. This is a panel of folks from Star Decks. How many of you in the room know what Star Decks is? Great. Because of you don't, you're going to be very educated in a few minutes. I want to start by introducing Cameron Titelman, who is the founder of Star Decks. It started out as a, essentially, as a project that he started as a student here when he was a student in the Management Science and Engineering Department. And then ended up spinning out into a very exciting venture. So I'm going to hand it to Cameron to introduce the other panelists. Hi everyone. I'm Cameron Titelman, Tina, thanks for the warm introduction. Just a couple of years ago I was sitting in your seat. So I'm very honored and privileged to be here. So our panelists today are some very, very impressive people. Way more impressive than me, so they'll have a lot more to say than I will. Our first is Joseph Huang, a good friend of mine. He was in a very early session of Star Decks, the second session. His company Wi-Fi Slim does indoor positioning, and I'll let him talk a little bit more about that. About a, I was a, oh, he can't say, but about a year ago, his company got a acquired by Apple for around $30 million, a couple years after founding. These guys are out of the PhD program at Stanford, and so I'm sure he'll be happy to talk about his start-up experience. And then we have Sida Saksana. So Sida was a math and computational science master student at Stanford. Was in the first program of Star Decks, and actually went through, and second went through another program of Star Decks a couple years later. Our first program was a financial advisory company that sold. And then she, well, I'll let her talk a little bit about the other ones, but she reformed another company and went through. Then we have Milton McCall. Milton's one of the EIRs that went through Star Decks, and he was with us for about a year. His company is really fascinating. It puts the iPad in the operating room to monitor blood loss. And Milton, I'm not sure if he'll say this, so I'll just say it for him, but he was an undergrad at Stanford, and he was a medical school student. And while he was in medical school, he won two Super Bowl rings for the NFL for the 49ers. And then he founded a couple of biotech companies, did a few things like manage the venture fund for Stanford's athletic school. And now he's spending this company. I also want to add that he was a classmate of mine at Stanford Medical School, so. You're a mill. Great. So let's start out. You assume, of course, that everybody knows what Star Decks is. Maybe you could tell us a little bit about what it is so that we all have a shared understanding. Yeah, so at the core Star Decks is a community of high potential founders at Stanford. And as an organization, we organize them to help each other. We do this in a bunch of different ways, and one of them is we have an accelerator program. It's basically a 10 week program where you have to have at least one Stanford founder on your team. You come in, we figure out what you want to learn. And then by the end of that 10 weeks, we help you learn that. We also help develop specific skills that in our initial research setting up the program, we found Stanford alums did or had learned to be successful. So in the initial stages, when I was actually in E-145, which is a class at the Palm Bires, who started STBP, put together, I went out and talked around 220 Stanford alums to figure out what made them successful. And out of that research, we figured out some patterns and some skills that they developed that made them successful. And a certain type of network they had formed around themselves. And so Star Decks is an attempt to educate entrepreneurs who are building companies out of Stanford, help them develop those skills and manage the extended network that develops. So let's pass the mic to these other folks because it would be really great to hear why they chose to be at Star Decks. Clearly, the three of you on the panel could have started a company anywhere. Why did you decide to take part in the Star Decks program? Great, so we'll start with my story. So as Cameron mentioned, we were in one of the very early programs. And so we were just grad students software in computer science, 2011. And we're in the process of starting our own company. And maybe didn't quite really understood what it really entailed. And we had applied to Star Decks mostly because other entrepreneurs have told us, hey, this is a really interesting thing to do. But once we had got in, it didn't take very long to realize, this is an incredible, incredible opportunity. And if nothing else, just an opportunity to spend your day to day with some of the other top entrepreneurs from around Stanford and future leaders and visionaries of Silicon Valley, I think is priceless. And maybe we didn't even appreciate that enough when we started. Cool. Yeah, so kind of echo Joseph's thoughts. I was, you know, again, I was also grad students. And I also didn't do my undergrad at Stanford. So I wasn't really familiar with the whole idea of startups. I came out to Stanford and was taking classes and kind of get sucked in. That's all everyone talks about. And it was like, when are you going to start your next thing? And so I took a class to learn how to code and we had a product and had no clue what to do to start a company. And so we were actually product started as first class. I remember our interview was that he was trusted. You know, really nerve-wracking. No, I mean, you have seven minutes to explain your business and we built a little project in class and we had to kind of make it sound compelling. But Cameron, you know, was really nice and all the mentors are really great and they saw something. And I think that's kind of their job is to take something very raw and mold it into a company that eventually got sold. And, you know, even in terms of the practical matters, like, you know, how do you structure your company? What are the legal matters other entrepreneurs have been through it? What are the pitfalls? How do you even think about fundraising? When should you be fundraising? I mean, these are all questions I didn't even know I should be asking myself before I got into startups. So, I mean, I guess, I mean, helped me the first time and then I came back the second time and it just as helpful and this is a bigger company. So, it's been exciting. So, my introduction to startups really was a little different. I had been in industry for 25 years. I had been in startup companies. I've been in venture capital. So, I was pretty familiar with whole process. But I'd come back to Stanford just cementoring at the Stanford Bio Design Program. Ironically, they were short to a business student that one-for-ter in the bag and it was a really easy polyoc acid to buy. It would actually be the business student on a team. That sounds kind of fun. I actually never went to business school. So, I'm not sure how I could have been involved with that. But I ended up meeting the co-founder of the company. At the end of the course, we ended up sort of deciding to start a company not based on that project that had been a different one yet had going on. And the next thing I'd say a few months later, he asked me, would I be the CEO of the company? And so, it's been two and a half years and it's been a great experience. We were fortunate because he knew about Stardex. I've been on Stanford for years and knew nothing about it. In fact, I've been trying to start something like this in the medical side at Stanford. But being in a lumb and having a bunch of people trying to help me, I realized it's really the student-sick and things that so somebody like Cameron and took someone like him to get this started. And I was able to join into it and be a part of it. It's been a great community. And I feel like I have something to offer some of these other, I'd say younger students are all I'm not. And the other man, many of them teach me stuff. I know nothing about iPads and software and all this. I'm learning up to my ears on stuff now. So, Cameron, maybe you can help us understand the relationship between Stardex and Stanford. I have to say I've been here long enough that I remember the days when Stanford was allergic to the idea of having any sort of incubation or acceleration programs. Basically saying, listen, Silicon Valley is one big incubator. Why do we need something like that? Maybe you could tell us about how this came to be and what the relationship with Stanford is now. Yeah, so I'll start with how this came to be. And I mentioned it briefly. So I built two companies when I was at Stanford. Two completely different companies. One was a private equity company. And one was an advertising company. And I learned a lot about entrepreneurship, specifically through the MSNE program. I took E145. I went to all the ETL classes. And when I was building my company, I found that I needed to learn a lot of really practical things. And I kept kind of hitting my head against the wall trying to learn it, trying to learn it. And then I would go and talk to my friends. Or I'd find some, I'd go to a networking event and find some mentor. But it's still, it seemed really inefficient. I got this really solid foundational education. But after that, it didn't seem like there was much support. Even in Silicon Valley, I go talk to investors. And to be honest, Silicon Valley is a great place. And it's a very, let's say, meritocratic and honest place. But there's still people who will do shady things. And so when I was talking to other friends who have built companies, there was a lot of issues they saw in Silicon Valley. So what I did is I did what I learned in Steve Blanks class here. As I just got out of the building and started talking to customers. And after talking to hundreds, this theme emerged where after a couple years, they finally figured out how to be effective in Silicon Valley. And so the people who built $100 million companies or $50 million companies figured out, hey, if I have the right support system around myself, I'll be successful. And they wish they knew it earlier. And then people who failed would say, I wish I had known how to build the support system around myself. Because when you're in a large company, you can go to HR, you can go to legal, you can learn all these different things. So after talking to them, it was very clear that there was this big, missing educational need. And there's this problem where if you could just structure the resources of Silicon Valley, they existed in a certain way, the process for building your company out of the university could be 10 times more efficient. And so the idea was Stardex wasn't to, let's say, create new entrepreneurs. It was to increase the speed of innovation and decrease the friction with people who will be, they might be successful anyway. But if we could move the needle on people who weren't successful, to be successful, and then make the successful people even more successful, that adds to solving problems in the world. And so Stanford, the relationship with Stanford initially, and you can look back at this, people are wondering, why are these guys doing what they're doing? Is this an incubator in the classic sense? Are we going to waste students time by supporting them if they shouldn't be supportive? If they should be thrown out into the wildest Silicon Valley? And it was very clear from our research that it was something that was needed. And so, we pushed forward. We built something, we launched it to our customers, we iterated on it. And a couple of years later, Stanford has said, hey, this is great, this provides a lot of value to our community. So initially, we are legally separate from Stanford University as part of the student government. And then after a couple of years, we spun out of the student government as a legally separate entity. We said a lot of relationships on campus. And earlier this year or late last year, Stanford was after talking to President Hennessy and the CFO of Stanford, President Hennessy is the president of Stanford for those of you who don't know. They decided that they want to financially support us to help us grow even further. So now they're giving us around a $1.2 million grant a year to help in our operations. And then separately, we have a fund with them. And the fund is a nondescussionary fund that any company who goes through startups, any participant can pull 10% of their funding round from the fund. And so, I think like any startup, we consider startups a startup. We had a kind of rocky start where people didn't really understand us, but now I've kind of broken through which is great. You'll be super to hear from the folks on the panel about maybe some interesting example of something you gained out of this. It's particularly interesting for the folks who came with very different backgrounds, right? Either folks who had come out of classes where you were taught a bunch of foundational material or even milled, you know, you were a VC. So you had a lot of background, you know, what sort of benefit are you getting from being this type of experience? There's too many great things about startups to give you one answer. So maybe I'll just start. So first of all, you know, we got there. And as Cameron mentioned, we're one of the very early sessions. And so we didn't really know what to expect either. But it only took, you know, a couple of weeks before we realized this isn't your typical startup accelerator. We've done some research, you know, to try to understand what a startup accelerator was in Silicon Valley and what really they do. And, you know, for example, we would walk in and surrounding us. There were more, first of all, there were more graduate students and undergrad. There are people there using building game, changing technologies in very, very interesting businesses. And it wasn't just, you know, a bunch of people making Facebook for cats. And, you know, like, and I touched on this earlier, in hindsight, the greatest value we got was just spending day to day with some of the top entrepreneurs from Stanford at that time, who are going to become future leaders and future visionaries in Silicon Valley. And, you know, we got to, like, I got to sit in a chair beside these people every day. Let's dig down into that. Did you spend time discussing your problems with them, the challenges? Was there formal programming where you were working together? I think it's incredible how much you can absorb and learn when you're both trying to tackle startup, raw startup problems at your desks beside each other. You know, when we had a sales problem and it was just, hey, these people aren't responding the same way we thought. And they, you know, they hit, they, some other, you know, Jet Lord gameclosure anyone sitting across the table and say, hey, you know, we ran into that situation. We tried this, it worked well, we tried this, it didn't work well. People had gone through recruiting, people had gone through patent strategy, pricing, the whole thing company I can go on forever. All the things you really need to do when you build a company, there's just great minds around you. And it's not just people who are there trying to tell you their stories because they're building their companies too. I can go on forever. I don't know if you want to. That's great. That was perfect. Yeah, so it's just mentioned, Stardex attracts great people. And for us, I think it really, at least for my second company, spot on especially, really laid the foundation of how we built the company start off with. So when I sold my first company, I took some time off and I reached back to out of camera and being like, hey, look, I think I'm ready to get back into the startup space. I may do another startup. And so he was like, yeah, sure, come out, you know, check out the news Stardex space. And I did and I was blown away as massive. There's so many more teams. Like, as Joseph mentioned, that it was this whole collegiate, you know, atmosphere, which was, which was great to see. And through that process, I found many co-founder, which was great. Again, he was kind of the same stage that I was at late nights talking about the problems that we were excited about. And through that, we also found our lead investor, again, another Stardex mentor who really liked us. I don't love with the idea that we're working on. And it was like, sure, I'll back you. Put together our seed round for us. And again, through Stardex, we found our first employee. And our next four employees as well. So what Stardex, I guess, really serves that as a really good filter for the kinds of people you want to be working with, and the kinds of people who can help elevate your business down the line. And also, the same time, it's just really fun people. I mean, it's very rare to find smart people who are really driven, but at the same time, how personalities and are interesting and in friends. I mean, I'm glad Joseph that I met you and then we get to hang out. Thanks. And so from that perspective, it's been great for building memories as well as, you know, start it. So I can remember the first day I landed the first day at Stardex. I'm an early riser, and I got a usual early to get to work, and I walked in the door, and I saw a few people there where I said, well, I've never been to people meeting me to work in the morning. But I actually recognized these were students that had been there all night long, and they're just leaving in a few minutes. So I learned that the culture is very different, obviously, but I'd say I thought a great example was I was a sitting at my desk, and Stardex has a bunch of tables, and all the founders sit around them, and it's a big community is what it really is. And I was chatting with the person next to me, and who is our director of engineering, and said, yes, we're having trouble with Apple. You know, they have anxiety pads, and we can't figure out how to make this work. And also, some of the turns around and says, oh, we did that last week with Apple. We met with this guy, Ian Jo, and here's his phone and we're calling him. He'll fix it for you. So it's this kind of collaboration community that really makes things helpful there. And in the same hand, I've been working in the medical device industry for 25 years. I mean, some of the companies are, they have a Stardex mid-group, and I remember having a lunch session one time, we just started talking about the FDA and how to deal with the FDA, and I spent 25 years dealing with the FDA. Nobody can ever deal with the FDA, but there are some tricks to work with, and I'm sure things that are helpful to know. And so I was able to share some of that. So I think that that whole part of being able to help your co-founders is really what's incredible about the FDA. So I'm curious, Cameron, how do you pick people? I understand that these days it's harder to get into Stardex, and it is to get into Stanford. So what's the process of picking people? Because clearly, the community folks that you have under that roof is very special, and that that's a huge part of what makes it valuable. Yeah, so to preface that, we're a 503 nonprofit, and we have an educational mission. And so what we want to do is we want to empower as many entrepreneurs as we possibly can. And so when we were initially starting, a lot of the reason why Stanford didn't want, they were allergic to this idea of an incubator, is they didn't want people who shouldn't be building the companies to be building companies. Actually, they didn't want PAC students to just do it because it was cool. They wanted them to, if they were going to build a company, to do it because they were really passionate about the problem that they were solving. And a lot of people in the 2000s were getting funded just like money thrown at them, and so they wasted a lot of their time just working on problems that weren't useful like Facebook for cats. And so one of our core criteria for accepting people is that they have an intrinsic passion for the problem that they're solving. So you have to have an ambition to solve it at a large scale. So motivation and passion are number one criteria. The second is team dynamics. So we don't just accept excellent entrepreneurs. We want them to be in highly functioning teams. Entrepreneurship is very lonely, very hard. A core part of the value we provide, we actually have kind of like a in-house therapist, psychologist, like a de-school at Stanford does. But one of the core values we provide is positive psychological motivation. Because a lot of times when you're by yourself coding alone in the basement, or building alone in your lab, it can get isolating. And so providing people with a community of peers that can benchmark against, that they can talk to about problems, they can't talk to investors about or mentors, and provides a lot of value. So having that core team you trust that you love working with, and that complements your skills, solves a lot of problems that companies face. And I think no one was in Harvard said 70% of companies fail because the team dynamic is you. So team dynamics is number two. The third is ability to build and build quickly. So just like Steve Blaine's concepts and the lean startup, you have to iterate quickly. Even in the medical device, even in the medical industry, we try to push companies for this. So they need to be highly technically proficient in what they're building in order to iterate quickly. So we actually do technical screen and technical interviews on biotech companies, on stem cell companies, on IT hardware, across the board. And the final and least important criteria to us is the idea. And that's kind of weird to people sometimes. Why is the idea the least important thing? Well, it's important that our founders and especially the CEOs have good strategic minds. So they can talk about the problem and lay out and break down and reduce the problem that they're tackling in an intelligent way. And then when challenge on something and incorporate that and listen well. And so sometimes people can't listen or founders don't want to listen and they're too stubborn to listen and that doesn't work. You can't iterate if you don't do that. So they need to be thinking through the idea correctly. However, everyone knows, well, you know, people like you know who understand the space, the initial idea you start with always changes. But it's important to us that the problem they're trying to solve always stays true because they're intrinsically motivated by it. How exactly they're solving it can change. And that's the framework we use. So how long do people typically stay there? I know that one session is three months. It's like, is a quarter. How long do people, do they say one, two, three? So most... So most... Yeah, exactly. Most people stay one. There's a couple teams that stay multiple quarters. So for instance, our medical program is six months long because there's a longer iteration cycle for medical companies. Early on we had a company, a great female founder named Karina Picart who built a Braille labeler, a more cheap, efficient Braille labeler. And that was a hardware company. And so she stayed on three sessions because the product iteration cycles are longer. So usually we say, well, you can stay on if you're going to become part of the staff and help the next founders. You can stay on if you really need help. And then we actually do kick people out if they're not making tough decisions. So there's one more problem. There's one more aspect about this too, which is Stanford and Stardex are these communities that are really powerful. And it's not how many sessions you're enrolled in Stardex that makes a difference. It's the connections and bonds you form and utilize with the people who you connect with and bond with while you're there forever. That matter. Right? And we are still getting help from people in Stardex today as well as people we interacted with at Stardex while we were there. And I don't think that's ever going to end. So technically we're in an infinite number of sessions. So that's a really good way to look at it. I'm curious about the transition out. You know, is that an easy transition? Does it feel like you're sort of leaving the nest or is it something you know you're getting kicked out or is that a really seamless process as you go from being in Stardex to then basically flying. And basically flying on your own. So we actually were there a little over here ourselves and we really felt like it was helpful for us. But what happened is the company got a little bit bigger and so we ended up eating our own space. That's always helpful I think because you know, that's part of the issue. But I think what Joseph mentioned is even the moment we left you're still connected everywhere from physically you come and visit and be part of it. But through the net and things, I mean I would say we're looking for higher people. We said the word out and the next thing you know we have started to people telling us things or we have somebody coming back Friday that said an expert in marketing is we're going to write a lot of product from you know Cameron sends out a message. There's somebody that's here that would like to help. So it's this constant communication that goes on I think it really makes started so different. Yeah and I think you know again, so I'm going to what you said the cost of communication definitely helps. But even when we transitioned out I think it was great that we are offices right beside another Stardex office. Stardex company's office and it's great you know we get to hang out still is also in the same problems and the community kind of comes with you. And you know we try to have events after as well and stay connected and spend being alumni as I guess is not as different as being so part of the program. You still hang around and are involved. Great so the community lives on so can you talk a little bit about the business model. You know this is an interesting and a lot of accelerators or incubators they take equity. They're all different ways in which this work. Can you tell us about the business model for Stardex? Yeah so one of the let's say what people say is a big differentiator of us is that we charge founders nothing. We don't take any equity there's no cost it's completely free. So the question is how do we how do we sustain ourselves it's crazy right? Well the core idea behind Stardex is a collaborative community of founders that helps each other. And so we didn't want to charge for that. We didn't want to put up a barrier to get excellent people in. And these guys can talk a little bit about that. And so what we do is we figure out what our founders need help with and who they can get help from and go to them and ask them to pay us to be able to help them. And it's kind of a weird thing. So we have partnerships with companies like Microsoft and into it. And on the medical side Johnson Johnson Genentech and J and J. VC firms like Sequoia Capital's a partner and Graylock and DFJ is a partner as well. And so they help us they well part of the part of it is they believe in the values of our program and our missions they want to support. Another part of it is they want to get in front of these founders. And so we've always been really stubborn and never creating an exclusive partnership because we want to have a level playing field fall of our partners. And that's part of our revenue. We've actually the only let's say a donation based revenue we've ever taken is from the Blackstone Foundation. And then we had a large grant from the Coffin Foundation in the past to produce a work product. That's half of our revenue. The other half is coming from Stanford right now. So what we're saying is we're going to bring excellent people. We're going to help them learn from each other and we're going to give visibility to people. And that visibility is basically what people pay for on the partnership side. And on the university side we're going to say hey look Jerry Yang never gave a percentage of his company to Stanford. Stanford didn't know anything but both President Hennessy and the University had a great relationship with them and so we ended up building a building here. And so what we're able to do for Stanford is drive donations through basically engagement and we're able to help them with our fund. With our fund basically. So yeah that's our business model. Super super. So who is there? You know when this started I remember it was students right students could be it was almost like taking instead of taking a quarter of broad. They could take a quarter at this you know accelerator to work on their projects. Now I understand that most of the people are participating are graduates and even alumni you know so milts you know I know how many years you've been out of school. It's the same as I have. So I'm curious you know what was the reason why you switched from really focusing on students to alumni. When you say participating do you mean like the staff the people? No I don't mean the staff I mean the startups the founders right it used to be that it was students students who were working on companies in their dorm rooms would come and spend a quarter. Now it's folks who are graduates. I don't know if that's exactly accurate. You know when we were in the program it was a mix of both students and people who had come out from you know further alums of Stanford for example in our session there was Lark who was making sort of a sleep tracking. iPhone accessory. Diffbot was making they're sort of using computer vision to solve unsolved problems in web parsing there was there's a number of people who added incredible value to us personally as well as to our company as well as to the communities. And these were already they were already Stanford alumni when we had gone through the program. And then today I think you still have a mix. I'm you know I'm taking part in the start X community events and things we still have many people who are students as well as probably the same mix of people who have more industry experience to offer. And I'll clarify the initial intention was start X so our first summer we took people who are currently in school and people who are graduating. And then the following fall we are wondering can we actually support people who are still in school is a possible and through that we had a company clear air Lily Trung who was spending 70 hours a week on our company on top of school. And she was finishing up her classes and she just needed some support and so we're able to help her and when I was building my companies at Stanford I was spending 80 hours a week on my company. And so what start X really is for are people who are going to dive into building a company. They're going to do it regardless of whether we're there or not that's actually something we've got for. And because they they're so crazy passionate about the problem that they're solving that they're going to do it. And so people are still in school and they're spending full time hours and working really hard and spending time at start X. We're spending time with the company will bring them into the accelerator program. Now that doesn't mean we don't still support other members of the community. Now one thing we do for instance is anyone who applies to start X anyone we get feedback from all the judges online and in person and we do office hours for anyone. And we sit down and spend hours hundreds of hours giving feedback because it's extremely valuable you don't really get that you go to a VC a pitch they say goodbye because we love you. It's it's it's it's me not you. And they don't really give that hard feedback and so we do that. And then and then you know what happened is we we have that segment that's like leaving the university working full time in the company. And what we've done is as our brand has grown we've gotten more and more people later stage. And so the percentage of non students has grown but the absolute amount is said relatively the same. And what we're doing moving forward is we're moving three blocks off campus to this 12,600 square foot building that the person who designed the D school at Stanford is designing it. And it will be moving in there in two weeks. And so over the next three months we're actually spending that doing this thing called this initiative called open X. And we're trying to take our accelerator program what we've learned from it what we've learned from supporting the extended community and open that up to more earlier stage and students. And so we're working with STBP and the GSB and having lots of events there. And trying to you know focus on saying okay well we kind of nailed this segment of the population now let's provide value to more people we're nonprofit. Terrific. So in a minute I'm going to open it up to questions from the audience to start thinking about your probing questions about start X. So I'm clearly a huge value comes from the community of folks who are working there. I understand you also bring in a lot of mentors and coaches. Maybe you can talk a little bit about what sort of people are involved in helping and what they get out of it. Yeah absolutely so there's kind of four things that we provide. One is community which these guys have talked a lot about. Two is mentorship and we have a bunch of different mentorship structures from serial entrepreneurs who are lead mentors to an advisory board. For instance on the medical advisory board of a company they'll have a doctor and a see if I have a hospital. To experts hundreds of experts I think they're around 500 that can come in and get on phone calls do office hours that sort of thing. But I actually pass it over to these guys they're all mentored and in fact we bring our lungs back to mentor the other founders. So maybe you can talk about what you could get out of it and what your mentors get out of it. Sure. Yeah we so there are plenty of people who offered great great help to us. I'll just pick out a couple. Jay Borenstein was our lead mentor when we were through the program. He's a professor here. He was a grad student in computer science just like we were. He started his company sort of not really knowing what to do just like we did. And you know what was really interesting I think was that startups is able to pair you. I think it's because they have 0% equity it's sort of they don't have an incentive. They're not purchasing mentorship. Right. When you find that mentor which who's exactly was you in your footsteps several years ago and built a successful company. It's a perfect match you both want to you want to get help them then they want to help you. And I think when you sort of open it up you have a 0% equity you have this really interesting dynamic you get you get super tailored help. And we couldn't have done anything we did without Jay Borenstein's impact and he's always been incredible. And you you sold your company now and so but you come back and help out other startups. I think yeah a lot of companies will come back and help and I think it's just so tremendous even while we were running Wi-Fi SLAM. The minute it was possible as soon as I tried sort of this mentoring other companies going through the program. I realized I had way more to gain from me like you know sharing what I'd learn and lessons I'd done with them. And then perhaps even they have to gain from these lessons themselves. Talk about that. Yeah so give you a couple examples first of all it's really hard to be objective with your own company when it's your baby when it's something you're working on you want to get perfect and you're every hour of the day you're trying to you know while you sleep you're trying to figure things out. And sometimes you just can't think clearly about it but when you're sitting there and it's another company maybe they're not in your domain maybe they're not. They don't say background is you and you're looking at you're like but that that doesn't make sense why would a startup why would you want to do that and then you walk out of that meeting you realize why am I doing what I'm doing this doesn't make any sense right. But you know it goes much further than that I think it's really inspiring as startups continue to raise the bar for people they bring in. You know you'll get to mentor teams that you know learn lessons that they've learned while they're building their companies you know and it helps you to it's sort of like two basketball stars of comparing notes at the all start game right you you can't possibly learn everything on your own and they as part of the mentorship process they have to report their progress to you sometimes they'll show up and we'll say hey we had this really interesting sales tactic and we went in there and work great and it's worked three times out of four and you'll say hey you know let me take notes like this is really interesting. And sometimes they'll just inspire you like sometimes you're you know starting a startup is like a roller coaster is as I'm sure you've heard a thousand times and sometimes it just takes you know another team pushing as hard as they can to overcome adversity for you to say all right I'm going to strap in I'm going to do it too and so it just I could go on forever as always. What about what about milk you've been trying to live. So so I learned in life really on that there's nothing free in life and although they don't take equity there is a there's commitment and the commitment is your part of the code and the code is you help out your fellow co-founders and every every founder is extremely busy you they were 18 19 hours a day we we pull all nighters there I had pull on there's a medical school and I was pulling all night or it started one night and it's just part of the code yet the same thing when one of your founders next to you has a problem and it's not you can help out and it's your obligation to stop what you're doing and it is a very interesting culture because it works it works because that's what everyone expects of you when you go there so they help you and you help them that's what makes the the system work. Right so I have a pleasure sitting on a board actually with Joseph right yeah so remember and these are all words of wisdom from Joseph I worked with this so it was a company that were presenting and they were in green while us and I'm not terrible because I mean here's a founder is me obviously there they're very casual they're doing and we just disagree and then a comment was made and this is always stuck with me it's like you know if you tell someone you want to build a rocket ship no one's going to ask questions you tell someone you're going to paint the shed so the everyone's going to be going on about what color and so that's exactly what's happening and then you kind of start thinking about well wait I've been in a situation before when when I when you know when I've been painting the shed and no one pointed it out to me so it's moments like that you know when you when you feel like okay great so I'm at the right place and this is you know I'm learning just as much as these guys are learning and I'm really glad to be part of this whole process and I think starting to the good is a great job of kind of making that happen because they take into account you know how I've working the past how the other mentors are working the past I'm going to have a poor with the team and having few teams and having a long night that are engaged kind of really makes it easy to make that happen so I really appreciate it that part of it. And of course something that's a core staff value and a core value of startups is feedback and constantly getting feedback from people around you your mentors your customers most importantly is essential so we get a lot of feedback from our mentors and a lot of what our mentors say well one there's an affinity like this person was me and so I want to help them another is they actually learn a lot like technology technological innovation is so fast there's so much new stuff happening that just by mentoring guys like Joseph you learn a lot of things like that. And then a lot of them come to me to say I learned this I'm going to bring it back to my company now and talk to my co-founders about it and so you know these mentors are there because they want to learn they want to they want to help people who are in their shoes and and you know there's a lot of people who want to get involved in Stanford want to get involved in startups just for deal flow for instance or just to like get stuff out and we actively vet those people out and we constantly are getting feedback on them and so people you know misrepresent something and they are bad actors in this community then they're out. Are they allowed to invest if you're a mentor can you invest? Not during the program so if you're active you have an active mentor relationship with someone you can't as a mentor you they actually they actually like have to agree to something that says they can't even like tell the founder they're interested in investing while they're mentoring them. Now after the program or after the mentorship relationship we allow the founders to make the decision we say hey if you want them as an investor here's the steps you need to go through the program and then you can't do that. So we're going to go through to make it an appropriate relationship and then we warn if someone's mentoring you they have inside information that they could use against you and in negotiation so just be careful about that and then we are again actively evaluating our mentors to make sure that they you know won't do things like that. Interesting thank you so I bet there are some questions who in the audience would start. Yes. Hi Cameron Joseph Smith at a note so we were also at my company Virgin Slabs is also a start X alum company and yeah one of the start X I want to say is very awesome and one of the things that we got out of it is that we learned we when we started we were trying to build sort of a lot of similar but different products the same time and actually advice from Cameron help to focus on making this product which glasses that can capture the point of the experience. So you know we've been able to focus get that manufactured how to even warn by Maccammur you know got investment from including from Tim Draper so I want to say thank you to start X and also my question is for companies that are participating in start X what are the recommendations for how to learn the most from that experience and then companies that are start X alums what are the best ways to give back to start X community. Can you just repeat the question. Yeah the questions are as a start X as a participant in a program like start X and start X how do you get the most out of it. One and then two as an alum or community member of start X how do you continue to get value and contribute value. So I'll answer the first one first the one thing I think I tell every founder that enters the program that I wish I knew when we started to sort of get as much as you can out of the program is take the time to get to know the other founders in your session it's really really easy to be heads down like if you're an entrepreneur you love working on your startup and you will do that every day all the time. And it takes a what you're only in the session for the 10 12 weeks and that first couple weeks no one really knows anyone there's no there they run events but but go out of your way to get to know these people they're all super fantastic and and if you do that you'll get blown away by who they are and you have a better sense of how you can really help them everyone is trying to do a lot of stuff and some things are just really really easy for you because of your background and really really hard for them. Because of their background but it doesn't matter because if you can save them three weeks of time with two hours of your time it you just create a really really interesting bond that will last perhaps forever. So, Smith, did you want to answer the second question? I'm sure like having alumni contribute towards startups. I think the best way we talked about this already is measuring and staying in touch with the community making sure that if there are other companies kind of in the field or some are related to you that you can reach out and make sure that you're helping. But I think overall generally speaking time to worst enemy has a startup you're always trying to solve problems as quickly as possible and this kind of again touches on just the point is that you really want to get to know the founders whether they're alumni or the existing class to make sure that you're solving problems in a way that you know the people have already tried it and found an optimal solution. And so that way you can collaborate make sure that you guys are reaching your goal together but at the same time making most of the program. Hey, you want another question? Yes, Bruce. It sounds like you're building up an enormous amount of social capital within startup. Okay. Have you started to track one creatively how startups founded companies or mentors companies are doing versus some of the other I think you betters in the valley. So the question is how do we quantitatively track the success of our founders and our companies. So again our core metric is what they learn and how what they learn translates to impact in their company. So we do track that we track how many skills a founder learns they come in and say hey I want to learn what this I want to learn this list and then after being ripped apart by alums and mentors they're like okay actually I need to focus on this list. And then we do help them develop those skills and then we ask them how does that how did that actually impact your company. Now that's on the nonprofit education side and there aren't really other people that are doing that on the let's say against for profit accelerators metric is usually funding or average funding per company. Our average funding per company is around 2.1 million per company that makes us the number two on that metric which for profit accelerators use that makes us number two in the world right behind why combinator a head of tech star is 500. Other other accelerators let's say and so you know our companies have raised I think 350 million there's 12 acquisitions. And 85 or say 80% of our companies are still going and funded 10% have gotten acquired 10% of shutdown. So in the startup world that those are great numbers and our core thesis is if we can empower high potential entrepreneurs and help them develop skills to reach their potential then they'll build successful things and part of that potential that John was talking about over here was helping them focus helping them throw stuff away if they need to throw it away. And that's all about helping them critically think about the problems is solving. Tracek another question yes. So my question is your manager is Cameron but I was curious in the earliest days of Sardex especially your student here. What was it like trying to establish these relationships with mentors entrepreneurs without really having this tangible metrics to show where substance really go off and show off but yeah clean. Yes so the question is the very early stages when I was starting how could I what was it like building the network and building this relationships relationships for to build startups without anything. And I didn't come from a background where my parents know a lot of people I was kind of a unit of one. And so what I did is is the most one of the most important things when starting a company which is figure out if you're solving a real problem. Very first thing and I with overwhelming evidence I had identified it was a real problem you know 70 founders had you uniquely said the same thing that yes I did this and I'm so glad I did this I wish I had done it sooner. But I'm unique and 70 people said that so it's like okay there's a problem here and so without problem then I could craft a solution or a very clear concise explanation for what I wanted to do and more importantly why. And so then when I went to people and explained it they got it like oh that makes sense here's the data that backs it up. And so they agreed now the question is okay even if they agree that's a problem why would they think I can do it. Well that's goes into salesmanship and some other things but basically what I did is what we teach startups founders to do I went to one founder I thought was great I asked them who are the other founders you think are great and they told me five people I went to all those five people and said what are the founders you think are great what mentors you think are great and I went to those five founders and 25 and five mentors. And then I went to those mentors talk to them and said hey which mentors you think are great and through that I got warm referrals and connections into hundreds of people and then you start drawing this kind of mesh network of who thinks who is great. And then telling people hey we're going to do this thing when it happens you want to be involved and here the other people are going to be involved. And so it's kind of like building a marketplace startup where you have it's kind of chicken and the problem and you had discussions about that week over week. So it was it was like getting one getting the other and using them to get more. Another question. Yes. Can you share how many jobs. Yes so I think the number of the question. Well the question is how many jobs have been created. So the last tally was roughly around 500. And so there's I think that we have a different number now but it's roughly around the 500 number. I don't know the exact stat right now. So what are your goals going forward. You know this is you have built something that is incredibly impressive. I mean I remember when this was an early seed of an idea and you were you know really had a lot of headwinds. You know when you when you started out so that you've really done an incredibly impressive job and clearly you know folks appreciate what you've done. What do you see as the goal is going you know five years down the line. Yes so the initial vision of startups was there's 40,000 companies that have been built at Stanford. Collectively they create $2.7 trillion of annual revenue. That makes it the 10th or 11th world's largest country. The people were the most successful leverage the group around them to be more successful. So the core vision of startups was if in the past all those 40,000 people or companies were helping each other. They could have created a lot more impact. So the next step was startups is saying okay well if we can leverage the entire Stanford entrepreneurial network to help itself. That could materially increase and improve both the skill development, the access to information and the access to people. So right now we supported people five years out of school, a couple people like Miltz. We've had a CS professor go through the program Monica Lamb, a bunch of medical school professors. And so the idea is okay well let's take this from from this specific stage we're at of really supporting companies in this extended community to really helping the entire Stanford alumni entrepreneurial community. Providing them value, getting value from them for the other founders. And then use that as a test case to potentially go to other universities. And so or be a model other people can replicate. Now there's a lot of universities from Harvard, MIT, to other places who have called us reached out to us and tried to replicate components. And yeah just like the epicenter is trying to create more entrepreneurial engineers all over the world. And all over the country we'd love to provide a platform to for universities and ecosystems to have a structured way for networks to help themselves. Perfect question yes. So it's not technology for technology sake but creating maybe a solution for instance on something as big as global warming and such. I know that's huge but so what type of criteria are you looking for outside of just the engineer come in with with an idea to develop that's going to really create a real real world solution. Can I jump in there? So, so. Okay sounds like the question was what criteria are there to make sure people are solving big problems for the world. And I just want to you know when we were in there we were the second session. I think they didn't have nearly as much leverage to sort of bring in great entrepreneurs but even us you know going through our session to our left was a company who had you know found a way to create a new world. And you know found a way to transform skin cells into beating heart cells so that they could do you know live screening of drugs and things. On my right was a company who had drastically transformed economics for solar heliostat technology using AI and robotics. And I mean you know here we are we're just doing into our positioning for smartphones like we're the ones that like really. And I think it's just inspiring when you sit beside these people you ask yourself hey could I be so you something greater too I think everyone motivates everybody and so maybe it's not just the criteria maybe it's just the environment. And I just want to re emphasize what Cameron said earlier about started in terms of picking companies they don't really look at the ideas so much it's really about the team because what you find out is it's all about. I mean so many ideas on how is my very first company and we started one direction within a year we were in a completely different direction and we have been very successful but it's not necessarily about the idea it's about the people getting together and leveraging the thinking process and a bunch of smart people that work really hard it's amazing how successful they can be together if they work collaborative. Back there speak up really that. How much cross pollination is there between teams like do you recruit people from other teams that are not doing as well as your company and vice versa do you lose numbers if you're struggling to other teams that are doing better. Sure and the question was how much cross pollination is there between teams are teams recruiting from each other. Yes that's fair representation. So I think the common theme for home ice and started success great founders and you have people at great power coming in one of working great ideas. There is generally again you know like good you full of thumb that you could basically say that you know obviously you know go out there and stealing one of those employees but teams break apart sometimes and things don't work out and started as a great place there to find where you want to fall into. So for example for us when I first went to start I was actually working with someone else and we ended up not working together and similarly now my co founder was working with someone else and they also didn't end up working together and which is again having an environment like start it's very safe and supportive it's perfectly fine to experiment and things don't work out and you move on. Charles and I ended up working together on spot on and it was great I mean at that point I time it just clicked it made sense we were like we're supposed to be co founders and now we can move on. So in that way it is partially true but it does create relationships where they wouldn't have been otherwise. Yeah so the one of the core things we focus on is reducing the barrier for people to help each other and that's trust. So we have certain community norms around not putting employees and not doing things that are shady again but then we also spend a lot of time building trusted relationships between the founders and creating rules around engagement. And what that does is it allows us we actually one session went from 15 to 30 companies and the work for the staff went down. It's like oh interesting and it went down because we focus on providing mechanisms for founders to teach each other and reducing the barrier and so yeah the core value we provide is creating trust between founders so they can help each other. Do you know what the breakdown is of participants coming from STEM backgrounds versus software humanities backgrounds? That get into the program or that apply so yeah so so I'm not sure about the applicants. We definitely have way more way more STEM backgrounds than humanities and that's we also have way more STEM people apply and we don't really look at people's backgrounds as a let's say we do look at people's entrepreneurial backgrounds. Have they have a tackled hard problems before have they tried to solve some inefficiency just out of their pure frustration with it. But you know there's we haven't had as many soft majors go through the program we definitely have had some we've had some people like there was one founder who was building a company kind of like a mint calm but for for minorities instead of using a web platform using cell phone just texting. But yeah we've had them but definitely not definitely not as much. Yes. One question is you said Stanford doesn't take any equity how does it is there any licensing deals you know Stanford. I mean if you so make stand up. So the question you asked is does Sartrex doesn't take any equity and you're asking if there's any licensing deals with Stanford is that the question? Is the question whether Stanford has any IP interest in this? Yes. Okay yes so Sartrex is a legally separate entity from Stanford and so there's no issues with licensing and we don't take any IP. So if if a PhD does research at Stanford and uses material resources Stanford independent of startups owns a part of that IP. And so that's kind of an independent process from startups. Yes. It would be interesting to hear from each of you if there's a single personality trait that attributes to a funder's success. So the question is is there any personality trait that you've seen contributes to the success of a founder? So Tom said it was asked once you're talking about a thousand times to figure out how to make a label and he didn't say fill 99 or 99 times he said he learned 99 or 99 times how not to build a label. And I think that's really what's key about entrepreneurs if there's one thing that you have to be able to deal with failure because that's what that's what the whole learning process is about. And I think that's what the support of the place I started Sartrex offers for you. As somebody mentioned earlier, entrepreneurs and startup companies are old posters and you're going to spend a lot more time on the downside of that roller coaster going and it seems like you're on the upside. So I would say if there's one thing I would say about it and this comes from being an entrepreneur capitalist and being an startup company to myself is, it just has to be perseverance. I think that's a wonderful writing characteristic. So I think this might be a little bit more random. I think for me the most valuable characteristic was empathy. I never thought this would be important coming into doing a startup. But I think it's been incredibly helpful when it's come to recruiting, to finding investors, to finding my co-founder and keeping relationships. Sartrex are very rocky and what that ends up doing is it ends up making you question, you know, the kind of decisions you're making and who you're working with and having empathy at those points of time and not really pointing fingers and taking a step back and talking through things can be very helpful and instrumental towards making sure that you grow this thing out before beating it to death in the beginning. Yeah, perseverance and empathy are far and away my number one and two, same reasons. I think I have a slight variation of that which is, actually it's sad. It's the combination of perseverance and empathy. What I was thinking is as a founder you have to be okay taking risks and failing and thinking of that as learning, just like Milts said. And you have to have this, I call it humble confidence. And it's a, it's a, it's this trait where you're strong and you could, you can inspire people to follow you because you, you're not afraid of making tough decisions or taking risks. But at the same time you're constantly listening and you're constantly trying to learn and become better and using every single opportunity interaction to learn something. And so you're both humble and extremely confident. On that note, we're going to have to call this to a close but please join me in thanking this fabulous panel.
