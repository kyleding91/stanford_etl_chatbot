 Hello ETL fans, my name is Toby Corey. I'm a lecturer at Stanford University and I'm here for another special ETL episode to offer my take on. What I think is truly a super unique year. Now 2020 has defied everyone's expectations. No one could have ever predicted this, but from the challenges posed by the pandemic to the extreme weather events, personal and professional lives have been massively disrupted. This has been a really epic year. But the entrepreneurs and innovators who visited ETL this year also brought us really incredible weekly lessons in how to find agency and act with conviction in times of crisis and uncertainty. Something that sticks out to me is my conversation with Ethan Brown. Ethan is the founder of Beyond Me and what really resonated with me is how entrepreneurship isn't an aha moment or it's not a silver bullet or it's not this incredible idea that you have in the shower one day. And it really is truly a process. Let's hear what Ethan has to say. This was not a aha moment type of idea. I had begun to think about this issue in fits and starts as a child in terms of not being comfortable with animal agriculture. And what I mean by that is I grew up in Washington DC and then college park Maryland. But my father who is a professor entrepreneur himself had time on his hands on the weekends and summertime and never really wanted to be in the city he grew up in the country as we were discussing prior to the the broadcast. And so every chance he got he would take us out of the city into nature and we bought a series of farms and the one that had the most impact on me was the one we still have today in the western part of the state of Maryland. And so we would spend a lot of time out there and it was supposed to be a place to recreate. But being entrepreneur himself. He also started a dairy operation there. So we had about a hundred head of whole steam cattle and until I got very familiar with animal agriculture. But more importantly, I just loved the the ecology around me, the animals in the streams and for us as well as the animals in the barn as well as those in our house. And I began to have some trouble making a distinction between which ones were units in which ones were pets and and why that one was afforded certain rights and the other wasn't. And so that kind of stuck with me as a young person. I didn't do anything about it per se in terms of career. I did become vegetarian. But I really felt strongly that some other issues as well climate and particularly climate. And so focused my career on on energy. But this kept coming back to me that there was something here that I wanted to address. And I got further into energy. I began to realize the impact that livestock had on climate. And you know, my company, I was a terrific company, valid power systems, we were spending over about a billion dollars developing fuel cells and the sector developing any more lithium ion batteries, solar cells, etc. And so I started to address a certain amount of carbon and greenhouse gas emissions. And yet this other sector of livestock was going largely unchecked. And there was almost no discussion over the time when I was working on this. And so that started to also bother me. And so this is a sort of confluence of personal ethos around some of these issues. And then ultimately the work I was doing professionally started to point me in this direction. And so I asked a very simple question, which I'm glad I did, which is, do you need the animal to produce meat? And I was never interested in a meat substitute. That's been done for hundreds and hundreds of years in Asia, particularly with the Buddhist temples. What I wanted to do was to understand whether you could build meat directly from plants. And that's the journey I started out on that ultimately led to be on meat. So as you can see, Ethan's a lifelong learner. And I think what also makes him really unique is this ability to connect the dots, the story from that time on the farm, thinking about animal agriculture, connecting the dots with climate change, and finding an untapped opportunity of a big blue ocean to go and exploit and take advantage of that. Join us for our next mini episode in ETL when another one of my colleagues will share their top 2020 takeaway.
