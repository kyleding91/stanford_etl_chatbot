 You were listening to the DFJ entrepreneurial thought leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Today, as I think you all know, we're lucky to have Lyndon Rive here. Lyndon is the founder and CEO of Solar City. He started Solar City in 2006 with his brother, Peter. And under their leadership, the company has grown to more than 13,000 employees and has become one of the most recognizable brands in the clean tech sector. They are now selling approximately one out of every three new solar installations in the country. But I just want you to know that Lyndon is not all working. No play. He's also an aficionado of underwater hockey and he welcomes all questions on underwater hockey at any time. Also working with Lyndon today is Tim Draper. Tim is a Stanford grad, as I think many of you know. His venture successes include Skype, Tesla, Theranos, Twitch TV, and so on. So hundreds of startups he's been involved with. He's long been recognized as a leader in the VC world and an outspoken person on many issues I'd say. And he's been called. We're all outspoken persons on many issues. And perhaps that's a bad thing. I don't know. Anyway, Tim has also recently received the World Award for Entrepreneurship, this was just given to him in China, and maybe also around a little closer to home. He's the Commonwealth Club's Distinguished Citizen Award for his achievements in green and sustainable energy. So without further ado? Yes, okay. Tim had forgotten the award before, but now anyway, let me give you Tim and Lyndon. And he is a very good one. Alright. So Lyndon, I thought I'd just start by starting with the question that's pretty much on everybody's lips right now. What is your theme song? And why? My theme song. Sure. He's used to these. We did this at Drapery University and good, this is a stumper. I know. I'm trying to think of Lyndon likes it about listening to music. theme song. How about something that matters to, like, I mean, it could be like we are the world, right? It's a good one. I didn't come to me like that, and I'll take it. We'll go with that. Okay, so tell us a little bit. Let's say Kung Fu fighting. Oh. That feels more like the theme song. It's Kung Fu fighting. That feels like that every day. Kung Fu fighting. Just going to fight. Keep on fighting. Okay, tell us how underwater hockey is played. I think we'll find out about Solar City. Yeah, I'm going to get to the point. Yeah, we'll always have time for that. So, Mask Funs, one hand in stick, a puck's made of lead at the bottom of the pool. You play six players aside in the water. You have four subs, so 10 players a team. 15 minute halves. You go down, hold your breath, play as long as you can. Before you run out of air, you give the puck to your buddy. You go up, get some air, and you just alternate. Now, it's actually not a big spectator sport, as you can imagine. But it's tremendous fun. If I can try and get Stanford to create a team, so any plug you can do to get there. Are there any rules? Can you keep a guy down? Yeah, no driving is allowed. It's kind of like possible where there's actually no real filing, but you can't check somebody. You can't be a little filing. It's actually a very, very friendly sport. It's often played co-ed. I'm actually mainly played co-ed only at the international competitions. Is it played many women? But mainly at the local pickups, it's co-ed. It's a real friendly. If you like swimming, this is far better than swimming. Swimming, you get tired of that black line for a long time. And then, if you like water polo, those are the type of players that often come and play the sport. You need a bottom that's uniform. Yes, that's the one criteria. You need a flat bottom. I guess you can play from side to side. You always play over the worth of a pool. Of a pool. So the worth of Olympic size pool. So 25 meters by 15 meters is typically the length and width. And feet, I forget what that is. I think that should be a varsity sport here. Okay, so you are a very close cousin to Elon Musk. And your brother also grew up in the family, apparently. And so your mothers were twins, right? Yeah. So what was it in this family? I mean, this is amazing what you guys have accomplished. And is it like, did they say, Lyndon, you have to save the world. You have to, you know, the world's getting too hot. We need solar energy. Or did she just sort of kind of let you run free and hopefully? I think the environmental thing came up way later. We were brought up in South Africa. The country still doesn't be recycling. It's just to put it in perspectives. So there's no, maybe they're just starting now. But it's not environmental. It's not a big focus. All he said wasn't when I was going up. That happened as we got older. And I'm not sure if it just happened that we wanted to solve the problem. But when you, before, solar study, we had a software business. And nothing wrong with software. Great great software companies out there. But when you're in the grind back to the comfort fighting, like every morning you're waking up and you just get into the grind and you just work, work, work. At the end of the day, if the only outcome is financial, that gets old and you want something that can get you more motivated. Because otherwise you don't work as hard. You don't push yourself as hard. And so finding a job where you can actually have a financial reward, but also have an environmental reward or a different award. It's something that helps humanity. That's exciting. You can get up. If you're passionate about it. And it's the double one. That's kind of what's related to it. So, yeah, you, okay. So before solar city, you ran EverDream. That's right. And EverDream did other, you know, it was a different business. How has that affected solar city? Did you learn something from EverDream that made you realize that you should be doing something a little different at solar city? Yes. So one thing I liked about EverDream, it was an okay outcome. It wasn't a wild success. We ended up selling to Dell computers for 120 million. In that period, we went through the dot bomb and give J-support rest of the way through, by the way. Thank you very much. They gave me my first $2 million check when I was 22 years old. Wow. Real money. But anyway, so let's start EverDream. But in that period, the financial crisis, or at least specifically the software financial crisis in the Bay Area occurred, and it was the technology crash, the experience somebody learns out of facing real, real problems makes you a better athlete. Like you just, you have to work harder, you have to hone your skills better. And so I'd say that experience helped a lot. And in solar city, we had to solve problems. Probably wouldn't have to solve. It's a company that didn't have the financial, or at least the technology crash. And then we grew out of that technology crash, and then they're having to sell it to Dell. So it was an okay outcome. But that I'd say was invaluable. So, okay. Solar city, you install all the panels everywhere, and then it generates energy, and that energy goes up onto the grid. And after a while, somehow you end up owning the whole grid. I mean, you end up owning at least all of the energy that comes off those panels. How does the financial model work? Yeah, so it's, when we started the business, the entire market, specifically the residential market, the only way you could buy a solar system is if you bought it. So you have to use home, your own capital to pay for commodity, which is an operating cost. And so the only reason for actually doing this is if you really are like a strong environmentalist, or you have disposable cash, and you look at the long-term returns, then it's a fair investment. So since the beginning, solar was a product for the rich. Like, you had to have lots of money to come out with it, and at least to disposable cash to pay for it. So we looked at it and said, okay, we have to create a business model, it makes it really easy for people to adopt solar. And the way how people buying energy today, they don't actually go pay for the power plant. They just pay for, you know, as you use it. And so we created that model and allowed us to install the solar system for free. So the customer doesn't pay for the equipment, doesn't pay for the installation, but only pays for the energy. And so then as the energy produces, they pay for that. And then we charge less for that energy than they currently pay from the utility. So given the choice of paying more for dirty energy from the utility, or less for clean energy from us, that's that helped us. That's enabled us to grow the level that we've grown right now. We made an easy decision for a customer to get clean energy. And part of that differential has come from some government subsidies that have declined a little bit. Significantly. What's the, what you're thinking on that, where do those come out over time, what happens? Why did they give you the subsidies in the first place, and then why are they decreasing them? And what do you think is going to happen in the future? Yeah, it's just all energy in the country is highly, highly subsidized. Like, highly subsidized. And the subsidies go so deep, you can't even identify the subsidies. Like, if you asked them, please come up with a list of all the subsidies, they will miss them. Like, kid, you're not. Not like, wait, you have an example. I said, I'm going to get that back off. It's a passionate point for me. In California, you have to get a bugging permit to install a solar system. That permitting process delays the installation. So imagine you have a highway, you've got cars coming in, and all the cars have to stop for a week. A week. That's going to cause a serious backup. Not only is it the cost of the installation, it's the cost of throughput of the business. There's a few things we don't need a permit in the state. If you're going to do a small fence around your house, you don't need a permit. If you're going to do a small retaining wall, you don't need a permit. If you're going to do a small toolset, you don't need a permit. And if you're going to do an oil derrick, you don't need a permit. They're saying, if you want an oil derrick, you don't need it. So it's just like, that's not an incentive. It doesn't get captured anyway as an incentive. It's just the way you deploy oil derrick. And you have the crazy thing. If you want to structure around the oil derrick, you don't need a permit for the either. All the fraternity guys are thinking, how do we build a derrick? Oil derrick, right here. Normally when I show this, I show houses in Malibu, nice house, beautiful house, world derrick, nice house. It's like, how did that just pop up? The building in Palm doesn't know they're there. You don't have to ask for a permit. That's our craziness in Texas. It's faster to get a permit for a fracking facility than it is for a solar system for a house. So that was just my little rampage on energy incentives. So at the start, solar derrick gets incentives. And most of the states offered rebates. So the two primary incentives. It's a state incentive and a federal incentive. The state incentives helped initiate the market. It was really, really important. In California, there was the Million Home Solar Initiative. That worked really, really well. Not quite a million homes, but it got these start of it. And it was a billion dollar program. The plan was that program to last for 10 years, that only last like six and a half, seven years. But the industry did its job. So the industry reduced its cost as the state incentives reduced. And now for the last three years, there's been no state incentives in California. Most of the states for the last three years haven't had any state incentives. So the only remaining state incentive right now is the federal tax credit. And the federal tax credit has a 30% tax credit for solar systems. And that's going to be expiring in 2016 for residential owners. And for commercial, it's going to go from 30% down to 10%. I hope this doesn't happen. It'll be bad policy if it does happen. But we are preparing for that. You said it will be happening. It's going to happen. It's going to expire. Oh, it'll expire. But is there possibly the choices? Do they renew or do they pull it away? Yeah. So it's going to expire unless DC makes a change. There's this fair amount of gridlock right now on DC. But I think it will get it renewed. A gig of a high probability than not. That it doesn't get renewed. If we look at the problem we need to solve, climate change is a real big problem. I don't know how many storms it will take for us to realize this. I don't know how many fires will take before we realize this. Like, how catastrophic does it have to be before we go, oh shit, we have no choice but to react. I think the signal will be loud enough right now. It looks like we have to turn the signal up in further. So hopefully we don't have to. But bad policy would be not to continue with that. As we have the solution to the world's biggest problem. And if we stop it, I think 20 years from ago, okay, we had the solution and we decided not to fix it. Because of a tax delta between 30 percent and 10 percent, that would be crazy. Now the true best solution to do is not to extend the federal tax credit for solar. Don't have it. But penalize those who are killing us, who are polluting the atmosphere. Like pay for the pollution. It's very basic. If the pollution was a liquid, you'd have to pay for it. Because it's an air, you don't have to pay for it. So pay for the pollution. And so there would be essentially a tax on carbon. But based on the political influence, I think that's a little probability of that happening. So if that's going to happen, then continue incentivizing those who are providing energy. That is, is not bad for us. So your work is two questions. Your work is saving the planet. It's an ambitious goal. Your work is saving the planet. The sun is sort of helping with the saving of the planet, but he's also trying to get us off the planet. Which is more important? It's a stand. And is there, do the curves somehow eventually flatten out where you get the global warming and then there's solar city? And it starts to flatten out. Or are you just sort of delaying the inevitable where we all just fry? For those who play a sport, do you ever give up? If you, like professional sport, doesn't matter what the score is, you never give up. Like you just play all the way through, because things can change and you can go through. Right now the score will look pretty bad. But I think we can one. But back to Tesla, solar city and Occupy Mars. The solar city, the solar industries are addressing our electrical issues. So electricity is the cause for the largest air pollution in the country. Right at parity with transportation. So electric vehicles then address that. So you have to address both our energy concerns and our transportation if you really want to have an impact on climate change. And so we're taking it from both angles. And then the jackpot is Mars. But that's more for just that's more for like a catastrophic event. Now, now do you, I mean, let's say the whole planet was covered with solar city panels. Does that slow global warming in some way or is it just a cleaner way? Does it make it so that there's less part in particular? What's the science here? So absolutely, we'll have an impact now. It will take a long time to undo, but you'll stop it from getting worse. But this is a 20, 30 year new stir. Like this is just big. And if it's just the US, the store doesn't solve the problem. We have to get the US, we have to get China, we have to get all the big countries. Then we have to start focusing on the developing countries because they're burning a cheap cost of energy, which is coal. So we have to address it all over the place. But assuming that scenario, if you had a magic wand and we can do it right now, what's all the problem? Absolutely. So here's another question. Have you thought like is your R&D department working on something kind of science fiction? Like putting solar panels outside the atmosphere and in effect blocking the sun's ray at noon or something like that. So somehow you're collecting the energy outside the atmosphere and then beaming it down. So if you think of all the energy that we burn right now comes from the sun, you use the light hits the plant. Just talk about the inefficiency. Just like to walk you through the equation of most of our fossil fuel. Like it's the plant, the tree gets bigger. Then eventually the tree dries. Then it goes into the ground for a million years. Then we dig it out. Then we hold it out to a factory or a plant. We burn it. That burn. And then heats up water, creates steam and makes it moves the turbine to create electricity. Then we hold that electricity all the way back to your house and then you can use it. That's step one. Alternative. Skip that process. Put the little glass panels on your roof, capture the light to create energy. I think that is more efficient than that other process. So we will get there. And the cost curve has come down significantly. So now we are more competitive than carrying more competitive than diesel. This is no subsidy at all. In the US we are more competitive than most energy sources. In most states, we are in 18 states today. But at least it's tied to the, it is dependent on the 30% tax credit. Okay, let's switch to your. One other comment on the R&D department. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We do have an R&D department. We just announced the most efficient module, solar module in the world. I'm not sure if you guys saw that. That was a big deal. Good job. That was nice. Taking a record from a competitor feels good. That just the same. That record will move around. It's trophies. You get to keep it for a little while. Competitor takes it. You get it back. It makes it all better. It's a good thing. But in terms of, as we look at expanding internationally, we go to many countries and back to the incentives. I'm from South Africa. And the finance from minister came to us saying, you should expand to South Africa. Okay. Sounds great. Good sun. Amazing country. What's your cost of energy? The cost of energy is around 15 cents a kilo. Okay. It's not bad. It's pretty good. It's pretty efficient. Why is it so low? We highly subsidized. We paid the government paid about half the cost of energy. You're saying without the government, the sub-study, your coal generation and your cost of energy would be roughly 30 cents. Yeah, yeah, it would be roughly 30 cents. Okay. So we need to come in there and compete and help you. Absolutely. We need to have a big energy crisis. We have blackouts all over the place. You go, great. So you pay for half of coal. What's your plan for solar? I know we can't give you anything. We have to solve this problem. You subsidizing. It should give you a 15 cents. Exactly. You could end up getting paid. But it is amazing how many developing countries are there. So we're a source of stimulants. It's to pay for the electricity. Which is bad. Rather just give it as a credit. Because it artificially holds bad energy cost low. And that's what we up against. And that's worldwide. Yeah. So you got to change people's thinking. You have to work on it. A lot of things. Every entrepreneur has to face that. And the entrenched people who are entrenched are going to clearly fight that. And so you're going to be. It'll be a fun long term fight. I'm fighting for you. Just keep fighting. So here are you've got. You said 13,000 employees. Is that right? It's 14. 14,000. We had a few. A lot of overhead. It's revenue generating. Yeah. We're trying to keep overhead flat. We've got a cap and trade program. Cap and trade is good. If you want to add extra one overhead, you've got to trade with somebody. So are they W2 or 10.99s or both? All our employees are W2s. Yeah. Okay. So they're full-time employees. Full-time employees. The benefits, stock ups, and everything. So it's like, number one, asking the company's own employees. Really make sure that they have good wages. It's the challenge. But we've successfully managed to pay people more at the same time, reducing cost. So that was, we're happy about that in the center plan that we came up with that enabled that to happen. So how do you, I kind of think, you know, people probably ask, how do you manage that many employees? But maybe it's how do you communicate with all those employees? How do you get that, you know, whenever you come up with something new and you need to pass that on to the 13,000 people, what do you do to make sure that it penetrates and they grok it and they're ready to go? Yeah. It's not easy. It's a big problem. So we've tried different things. The one that's seem to work right now is every week we have what we call Solicity TV. And then we'll get different people to speak on the TV. It's an armor show. We broadcast it into the entire company and it's a good participant that shows up. So we can track the amount of people logging on, how many people watch it afterwards, and that's a good way to get information out. And then email is never that great, but we do a fair amount of email. The email is intense in the company, a little too much, but that is a form of communication. And then just making sure that you communicate to your leadership as much as possible, so that they can carry it. Is there a feedback loop back to you? Is there some way that they see something out there in the marketplace they can turn around and say, hey, you want to pay attention to this? Yeah, so it gets harder as the company gets bigger, but the culture that we embrace is a total open communication. Anyone who understands me, I always respond, although there's a lot I'll get back to them. Best to send me emails on Fridays, because you can have the best of them. Good weekend. If you send me an email on Monday, I could be on a long response time. You may have to wait till the next Saturday if I get to that one. Weekends are my catch-up time on an email. So I always respond on that. It's a cube environment, which is common here in the Bay Area. And make sure you get out of the field all the time. So you do it all on weekends. Your wife doesn't like that too much for her. So you have the trick. So I have some of the same problems. So I just want to look at your problem. The way I think I managed to solve this, is I managed to find my wife and I was really young. We met when we were 14. I tried a data for two years to say no, but at 16, she said yes. So we've been together ever since. I got married at 24. Had our first kid at 30. So she's my last-time partner and the best person in the world. But the secret of that is she doesn't know anything better. Like, she doesn't know what to do. You mean this is how it works. And so then when I find friends, I make sure the friends with husbands like me, meaning that they're never there. They're always working. So you keep this little box. She's starting to figure out it's not true. And at 80 hour work weeks, it's not normal. And that the data, or the husband, actually has to be there sometimes. So the pressure is getting there. We've negotiated a lot of things. I'm a very, and a little guy like data, I like to measure things. So when there's a debate about, hey, you're not at the family enough. But it feels like I'm being at the family enough. No, you haven't. And so this emotional thing, we just have to guess what the right answer is. I can't handle. So we actually came down to a quarter. 16 hours a week is my quarter that I have to achieve to be with the family. I know it sounds rude or something. Can you be sleep during summer? No, no, it has to be quality of time. So 16 hours, you know, it's doable. So if you do one hour a day, then weekends are okay. If you don't do anything in the week, then you've got eight hour a day, so weekends with the kids. And that's a long day. I love my kids to bits, by the way. No, it's not. But yes, so that's, it's his fantastic, but his management. Okay, so back to the business. When entrepreneurs come to me and they say, hey, you know, what should I have to get funding from you? How do I do that? I'm always saying, well, one of the things I'm always looking for is how do you get your customers to become your sales force? So what are you doing to getting your customers to become your sales force? How do you get them out there doing your work for you? Yeah, that's really good. One third of our business comes from our customers. And so that's, and so we've essentially created this ambassador program. So there are referrals from neighbors or something? Yes, so it's a dual referral. If you, if you're a customer and you refer your neighbor, your neighbor gets a discount and you get an incentive. So it's, if you don't do it that way, you kind of something out your neighbor, because you get in the center. And now the difference is you're hooking up your neighbor. Very big difference. And so this is a small change. So hook up your neighbor, get them a discount. And so that has worked well. And then they can become ambassadors to hook up their neighbors to and on ambassador program. And sometimes homes don't... So if you guys are the leaders in this market, and, but there are still some competitors that are coming along. What is your competitive advantage and how is that going to play out in the future? And is it easy to jump into your business or not? And, and then maybe what might come and hit you from some other angle where you get blindsided like Napster did to the music industry? Yeah, yeah, so the... In terms of different shades of us, is our vertical integration strategy. So from the beginning, we decided to vertically integrate. Now, the downside of that is you have to manage 14,000 people. That's a lot of people. Now, the upside of that is you can optimize costs. You can optimize customer experience. You can optimize for product. So earlier on, we made a decision to vertically integrate. And so when we looked at our competitors, they were not... In order to get solar, somebody asked, would solve you the system, then another... And I would probably do the installation too, but some other one asked, would do the financing. In some case, you'd have extreme. You'd have somebody, solve you the system, another person would do the financing, and then another person would do the installation. In fact, it's still quite a bit of the market. You have three different companies you're working with just to get a solar system in your house. And so out of the gate, our competition was ahead of us. Because they could leverage other people's infrastructure and have them do the sale of the installation. But when you are in a small market like us, that infrastructure gets depleted. They can't grow more than those 20 or 30 partners. And the only way they can grow is either they provide the working capital needed for those companies to grow, or grow the rate that they can just grow with their own profit that they make. It's just...it just won't be able to grow faster. So... You get some of the panels from other suppliers, or all of them coming from your facility. No, actually today, all of it is coming from other suppliers. I'm not...in fact, we will only be up and running in 2017. So here's some interesting thinking, and how you...I'd like to know how you came up with this. Okay, the suppliers of solar panels have fought each other and the margins have gone down, and the price has gone down, and you've been able to take advantage of that. The fact that everybody's price is going down, and it's getting to be a commodity, and it's...in lots of them have gone out of business, and what made you decide you wanted to do that? Instead of just...yeah. Instead of just using this amazing system where everybody's...nobody's making any money, and you're just taking advantage of each of those suppliers. I think that's probably the one thing that most people go. That move is a high risk move, so why the hell did you do that? When we were looking at the solar industry, and we're looking at modules of solar supply, and we're looking at all our suppliers, no one is investing. You'll get a point where you just can't drive the cost down, because the glass is going to cost the glass. The glass is going to have a cost. The aluminum around the frame is going to have the cost, the plastic or the back sheet at the back is going to have that cost. So you're not going to be able to get that cost down, because those are very much pure commodities. But if you have generation 2s, if you have higher efficiency, this is to simply say, if your modules double the efficiency, then you can provide double the amount of power or energy on the same fixed cost of that sort of frame. That's why we invested into it. We can create higher efficiency solar modules at the same price as standard efficiency modules. If you're able to do that, you can even store more energy on a roof, or install less panels on a roof. And so you actually have no money, do you have the extra revenue from that power, but just have efficiency in your crew and your producer cost? So if you play that out, though, won't other suppliers go, oh, I see how you do that. I'm going to do that, too. And then they start driving the prices down again, and you've got this big plan, and all these assets you've wasted on this thing, and somebody else is doing a better job. That's right, you're just going to do a better job. You have to just keep pushing. So you're thinking you might just keep driving new technologies in there. Keep driving, but it's growth. And if you fast forward three years now, four years from now, our capacity, the manufacturing capacity, you're only going to be one gig. That only may be half a third or quarter, depending on what you look at of our volume. So we want the other ones to get a product as good as ours. If we wanted to come down, we wanted to push the industry to say that standard efficiency is not OK. Like, no one is working on generation two, and the only ones who are working on that are startup companies. You just don't have the capital and don't have the bankability assets. So it's like the circular event that even if they do have amazing technology to get a two market, it's near to impossible, because nobody of the buy the module, because there's no warranty behind it. At least it is, but it's nothing. And so you have to get the big manufacturers to chase this technology. And my hope is that it pushes the other manufacturers to do it too. And now you're manufacturing these in the United States. So did you run into any problems or opportunities or whatever by setting up a plan in the United States? And what state did you put it in and why? Yes. So we're happening in New York, it's in Buffalo. So it's a million-screen food building, except a live camera feeder. It's a stubbing built. It's really cool. When we acquired the solar company, that... It's in Buffalo. Does it benefit the manufacturing to make it cold? To have cold weather outside? Yes, not really, but the whole thing that the fact that it is in Buffalo, one of the primary reasons is you can use hydro creating solar modules is energy intensive. So if you can actually use clean energy to create clean energy, that's better than using dirty energy to create clean energy. So are you using Niagara Falls to do this? Yes, it is. What do you pay per kilowatt hour from the hydro? We're still negotiating, but just standard rates are around five cents a kilowatt hour. Wow. Actually, one of the reasons... That's cheap, by the way. One of the reasons why we have a factory in China, one of the reasons why we didn't do the big factory in China, is that the cost of energy in China is actually fairly high, it's like 15 cents a kilowatt hour. And so when you look at your shipping cost, not just your shipping cost, when you ship equipment, you have your carrying cost of your inventory on the ocean. So you go to include that into your working capital cost, combine with the energy cost logistically to think that Buffalo can be very competitive. Yeah, that's great. Buffalo needs the jobs too. That's the last time there was reason. I'm sure they give you any. It's fair. So I guess we've gone into most of that. Are there any other things that you're thinking about as you grow this business, as you... What is it going to look like 15 years from now? I always have this 15 year rule for my entrepreneurs. When they come to me, I say, is this company really going to be there in 15 years when we have self-driving, trucks that take all your... They're robot factories that take everything through self-driving trucks that construct your house by itself. Little printer. Yeah, with a 3D printer. And all those very strange, interesting things that we're kind of excited about having happened. In 15 years, what does Solar City look like? And how are you going to make it even cooler? Than it already is. So I think this may have been happening sooner than 15 years. We're starting to see this... this occurs. It's right now. Most of the markets we're in right now, we compete against the utility. That's our number one competitor. We're starting to see policy shifts changes. We're going to have two customers. We're going to have the homeowner to which we sell energy to. And then we're going to have the utility as a customer as well to where we sell grid-related services to. So that I think is going to change. And so then what's going to happen is the utility... I don't think the utility is going to go anytime soon. So the utility provides a good feature. The utility is now going to have access to millions of little infrastructure themselves. They can use other people's infrastructure. Now we've seen this model happen. Like Salesforce.com is probably known for software's of service. And they kind of created a logo around that. No software. This is essentially infrastructure as a service. Somebody asks us provide an infrastructure. And the utility then we use that infrastructure as a service. Now why this policy has to change? Today, the utility cannot use somebody asks the infrastructure because they don't make any money. Like the rule is very clear. You only make money if you pay for the infrastructure. If you don't pay for the infrastructure, it's a post-recost. If we sell it to the utility for $10, they can only rate-based $10 so they make no money. If you create an open field, it will allow tremendous innovation into the electrical infrastructure. I don't know what technology is going to create it. Create an open platform. Say yes, the problem. But after solution, utility subscribes... Takes that the winning burden of that solution. If the utility would have done it themselves, this would say that project would have cost a million dollars. They'd put it out. And so that would make 10% of that million dollars. If they'd put it out, new technology would come out maybe only cost 500,000. It still makes 10% of 500. But this way, the utility has a lower cost. The rate payer has a lower cost. And it allows for innovation in a market that has seen almost no innovation. Like the best innovation that we have right now is smart meters. And they're not that smart. But it's not being used. Like you don't have to go and send somebody to actually measure the meter. By the way, a lot of places still have to measure the meter. But it has no control function. It's just such a, so you just remote measurement of your meter. That's the stuff we've done in the last 15 years in our electrical infrastructure. Let me put it a bit in that. Could you start to link solar city customers and create your own grid? And would that make any sense? We are doing that. So we launched a microgrid product beginning this year. And it's starting to take up. It did really well. And why it's important for microgrid. Not necessarily because we think that's going to be a big market. It's going to be a decent market. But we want to show that this combination of distributed solar and combined storage makes the grid more stable. You actually have a more reliable grid. You actually have it far better. So we're going to prove it out. And then go back to the utility. And partner with the utility. You say, look, use this. Use this software. Use this application. Use our assets. Get other people to log on to it. And manage your grid more efficiently. And you really think it's worth it to bang your head against that wall, that utility wall, rather than just slowly but surely build your own grid so that we don't really need them. So the one thing that you do. Or is it that solar doesn't quite generate enough? No, we can. So one thing that you need is load balancing. And only when you do that is you have to have a wire from has to has. Right. And then you need the, I mean, you could have batteries too. You have batteries. Maybe if you have batteries. So if you have a software-canned unit with no access to the grid, you have to design the system for your one-day peak load of the year. And so it's a pretty typical, you're oversized in the system for your use. But if you can connect wires from one house to the next house, this person's one-day peak load doesn't match this person. You can load balance. And that's essentially our distribution infrastructure. That's what the utility has. That's what they provide. The lines coming into our neighborhoods are ugly. We definitely do not want two of them. Right. So that's the one place where the monopoly store makes sense. It is to only have one set of lines coming in. And so you want to bang your head against this. Okay, well, what if you did this? Every time you installed in a house, the deal is you also drill underneath and you drill a wire that goes into every neighbor's house to the wall. And then if that neighbor signs up, you then link. And then another neighbor signs up and they're linked. And then just slowly but surely it just grows out. Nobody sees it. It's down on the property. I love that idea. I don't know the fact that it's illegal. Wait, wait, no, no. You go to the end of the property. Oh, it's illegal. You go to the end of your property? You don't have to connect to home's electrical system. No, I connect them. You're not allowed to? No, I... Even if you buy two. Who created that law? Even if the property is your own property. You can't connect them. And then it's to get special approval to do that. But yeah, no, no. Is that just like the utilities have rigged the deal? Oh, a lot of cases. That's the case. So not impossible to get a chance. But that will be a big... That will be a big fight. We can start hitting it up. I was thinking you send the wires just to that place. Yeah, I like that. Yeah, that's a relief. And then you do it on the other side. You only connect them when the law makes it. Yeah, exactly. You get everything on the right. You get the columns of scales. And when the law turns on, it's boom. Yeah, exactly. I like that. There we go. Hopefully they can change it for then. Okay, I got one more question. You guys probably have the hook eventually. But I got one more question. And that is, how do investors value solar city? Not today. Not very well. I mean, today it seems undervalued. But how do they look at it? How do the optimistic investors look at it? And how do the pessimistic investors look at it? And because it's such a complex system. Yeah. Over the loans and then long term, you become a utility. And so the best way to look at it is what value are we creating? Every time we deploy a solar system. So when we deploy a solar system, we have to pay back our tax equity investors. We have to pay back our debt providers. So after we've paid back everyone, how much money is left for us? Because the tax equity investors and our debt providers cover our cost. So we have to pay them all back. And when you do the net present value of that cash flow that comes to us, after we paid everybody back, we make roughly a little over a dollar or what. This year, the forecast that we reported in a last earnings column was 900 to a gig of deployment. So at a buck, that would be roughly making 900 to a billion dollars a year. So that would be a current level. And that's 900 to a billion dollars revenue to you or net. So it's net after all cost. No way. Company should be worth 20 billion dollars. So then the debate comes in with investors is, okay, well, that value is an NPV net value over a 30-year period. We use the 6% discount rate. Some investors may use an 8% discount rate. Probably whatever discount rate you want, it's worth a lot more than it is today. So then... I see. So that's a dollar or what now, but it happens way later. It happens over 30 years. So you're really getting a dollar or what over 30 years. So you do have to put some sort of a discount rate. In 4 dollars or whatever over 30 years. Oh. Yes. So the NPV value is roughly a dollars. So NPV at like a hurdle rate of 3% or something. We use 6. And so the... You can run sensitivity. And if you just look at our current installations, so after that, everybody asks, it's roughly around 3 billion dollars. That's just the assets generating cash today. That's the assets we've deployed. An example I like to use is, we have a gaze, it makes golden eggs. If you just look at the golden eggs, that's 3 billion dollars. Currently there's no value for the gaze. For the goose. So what's more valuable? The thing that makes the golden eggs? Or the golden eggs? And... The thing that makes the golden eggs in case you're wondering. They're figuring it out. It is midterms. They're trying to figure out like what... Actually, there's more valuable than... The answer is AB or none of the above. The thing that makes the thing that makes the golden eggs... The golden gaze is... So what's our timing? Anybody... What time is it? It's 5.3. Okay, we got 7 more minutes. Okay. So yeah, in a second. Okay, so... What... How do you think... You know, you've dealt with local governments federal government and state government. You've dealt with all these governments. What do you think we should do? I mean, well, first, do you think they operate properly? And then second, what needs to happen? So, government's very much state. Quite a bit. I got to give tremendous credit to California. I think it's one of the best governments in the world. Governor Brown is an incredible reader. And he's passionate about our challenges that we have. So, he's a good policy in California. They've came up with long-term programs. Those stops and starts. And as a large industry, they grow. So about 40% of the US industry is in California. New York is not reinventing its whole electrical infrastructure and it's starting to deploy that vision I'm describing where... where it infrastructure is the service and you can interact with the utilities. So that's going to be another... So Governor Cuomo is another strong leader in this area. A few of the other states have done two of it. But a lot of states have done anything. So, we have the solution. We know how to solve the problem. We just need to start impriming it. And I think the biggest thing that can happen, like the industry is growing at 40%, 50%. It will continue to do really well. But the biggest risk to the industry right now is that it says the 30% tax credit. So that would be a federal policy. And it would be a shame to see... Federal policy to get rid of it completely. It automatically expires. Or this goes down from 30% down to 10%. And this is an active change to keep it at 30%. It won't. And you said it's 2016. So you would... That would have to happen in an election year. And that would be... It would be hard for people to get anything done in an election year, right? Yes. So the... There's a small probability that it might happen the end of this year with the World Export Bowl that may get momentum. And if that gets momentum, then as a trade, I would continue the failed tax credit. If that doesn't happen, then the only other option would be in the lame duck end of next year. And then if that doesn't happen, then you would have a lapse on the credit and it may be get it through in February-ish. When they renew... How long do they renew for? Is there some period of time? We have no idea. They just made it. So before it was renewed for eight years. But fossil fuel doesn't have an expiration, just in case. Okay, we had a question right over here. Yes. Thank you for sharing with us. I have two questions. First of all, you talked about the two different customers, the homeowners and the utility. And we thought about enterprise with government or different company agencies. Second question, you talked about the policies that... That might even be changed, such as tax on carbon or incentive, less incentive, the 30% connecting neighbors. What do you think is the most inhibitor, like the one thing that you need to change in terms of government policy to move this forward into the next phase of expansion? So... What's the first question? Well, he wants the 30%. It wants that to stay. Yeah, 30%. He said, what government policy? Did you think the question for the... Yeah, well, he said, well, what government policy needs to change to improve the environment for something like solar city to survive? Definitely the 30% tax rate. That's key. But the other part of your question is businesses as well. So we know for our residential business, but we actually are the largest commercial provider too. We've now just taken the leaderboard on it. We have about 8% of the market in our commercial rooftop installations. So I would do a lot of commercial as well. Okay, cold-called question right here. Front row, texting. Come on, what's your question? No, she has one. Come on, here it is. She's ready to go. I guess so I'm a medical student and I'm not an engineering student, but I guess my concern is that you have solar energy about what fraction that is converted to actual electron. So what's the efficiency? So the question is, what percent of the energy, the solar energy coming into the panel, is converted to electrical energy? Yeah, call it dependent on the modules, but between 15 and 22%. And where the new panels? That's the 22%. 8% is deflected off into a heat-right. Yeah. So you can create deserts essentially where you are sending off really high energy heat into the atmosphere and I can have a lot of environmental considerations that might be hard to model or predict at this point. But I'm interested to know in terms of your concerns with the lack of efficiency, but then also the underlying damages that you can take, like what do you... No, no, the heat comes anyway. So 100% heat's right now. But in terms of the environment, or the habitat beneath the actual plants? Beneath the plants. Yeah, because you create these factories, right? There was an example that I write about in Arizona where they create these large solar plants to collect and plant those solar energy. But then people have concerns with that surrounding environment, because obviously you can't... This is solar thermal. So you've been reading about how the tortoises had to be moved from... So there's different ones. So you have one that reflects to a concentrator that then heats up water. So that's a different technology. Still doesn't cause damage. I think when I just emphasize, well, there's some environmental impact, but a lot less than a power plant. The alternative is like, go there, build the nasty power plant, and that has a far bigger impact. There's some clear, complete clear size. You have to keep ours from 9 am to 3 pm. And if these are commercially available, can they build in homes? I mean, the energy that you produce is per square meter, like, 4,000 watts? So roughly speaking, a per square meter, you do 1 kilo per square meter, is 100 percent efficiency. That's just kind of how the math turns out. So if you do that, you're looking at a tuna watch. What hours? I'm definitely doing another cold call. You. Yeah, yeah, you got a question? Come on. Best questions come from the cold calls. No, no, no, look back. Come on. Yeah, you. You got a question? I think that's a little bit of a sin. You got a question, come on. No, did you hear that? You hear those questions? I didn't understand it though. Well, they were the best questions. So go ahead. No, no, no, no. Okay, go ahead, take it, whatever. I work for a software company, Solar Software Company is a service called Sighton. We do sales and financial SM management and road system design. How do you see technology we talked about when there's going to be the self-driving trucks and factories? How do you see technology playing a role in years, the next five, 10 years in your sales and asset management level? Massive, like 50. When we got started, a good engineer would take a day to do a design. Now they do 10 designs a day because of software automation. So it has a massive impact. And coming to doing that, I think, not just the design aspect of the full asset management, sales management, yeah, absolutely. That can have an impact. Okay, we're going to do one more. I'm disappointed in you. You in the back always center back. It's always the weirdest question. Come on. So my name's Anadie, I'm from the Graduate School of Business. And my question is related to energy storage. So when the Tesla is getting a lot of factories that comes online, is that going to affect your business model at all or not? And second of all, if any of us are particularly interested in energy storage, should we be pursuing that through Tesla or when they're being ruined solar city electricity? It depends on what you want to do in energy storage. So first question is when the factories, the giga factory, there's two giga factories, one solar, one battery. But when the battery giga factory is up and running, what type of effect will that have on our business? And then the second one, if you're interested in getting into the space, in the battery space, doing the giga, so you go through solar studios, so you go through Tesla. So first one, as soon as the giga factories up and running, is actually in the health of business tremendously. And it will even help it before it gets to full capacity, because the cost of storage is coming down dramatically. And as that factory ramps up, the cost comes down. We can start adding this to our solar systems, and really creating an interesting product. Once again, the product is not necessary back up, although that will be the initial product. The biggest product is offering grid-related services to the grid. That's the infrastructure of the service part that was described earlier. In terms of what you want to do, it depends on what your personality is. If you're looking at applications for deployment, then solar-city is a good place to go. If you're looking at engineering, how you can improve the chemistry of batteries, then Tesla is definitely the better place. So it depends on what you want to do. All right, we're done. We're done.
