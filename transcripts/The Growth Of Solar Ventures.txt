 You were listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at edcorner.stanford.edu. So I'm really happy to be able to announce and introduce today's speaker Larry Bowden is not just a serial entrepreneur, he's a parallel entrepreneur. If you've looked at his introduction, he's actually in the midst of two ventures, right? Simultaneous? Just switched over a new one. Okay, okay. So those two are J.D.Power and Q.1 Nano Systems. And he has been in solar and alternative energy since before it was fashionable and was really great today at a point in our history where everybody's interested in an alternative energy is to have Larry come and talk about his lessons as somebody who's been a real pioneer in that category. So Larry, we're delighted that you're here. We look forward to hearing what you have to say today and welcome to Stanford. Thank you for the invitation to come speak with you guys tonight. Throughout the next hour, I prefer questions as I go as opposed to wait to the end. So if you have something to thought or a question for me or for the audience, please just chime in and let's make this as interactive as possible. As it was said, I am on my third startup and all of them have been in the clean tech sector. I just want to do kind of three things with you. I just want to give you a snapshot of my backgrounds to the understand where I've come from. Take you a little deeper in the two bigger startups I have done, which is J.D.P. and Q.1 Nano, which we have just renamed recently, is now called Blue Solar. So if I refer to as Blue, it's the same Q.1 Nano that was introduced earlier. And then I want to share with you some of the observations I've been seeing just recently, you know, last quarter, last six months in the clean tech space. Things are happening incredibly fast. For the first time ever, and I've been around the space for 13 years long before it was ever popular, people are really getting their heads around solving the problems that every level possible, which is government, startups, big companies, small companies, strategics. And I just want to share a couple of facts I've picked up. I just got back from Europe three hours ago. And share a couple of thoughts that I want to share with you that what's happening over there is amazing how fast they're moving out on renewables and carbon neutral buildings and facilities. And then I just wanted to share some thoughts on just how fast the world's moving out compared to 30 years ago is unbelievable. The exact right time, it couldn't be better to start companies. Because with change, there's opportunities. With opportunities you can dive in there with the new business model or plan and make a huge, huge impact. So please ask us as we go. Let me just give you a quick snapshot of kind of where I came from, a very large, diverse background. I spent eight years racing cars. How's that? From car racing to the clean tech. There you go. I got bored going fast. I decided we would put things up in space and cost 20,000 miles an hour in orbit. So there's an extreme for you. But the space industry was very interesting in that when I got into it. My first year I took a quick trip to Europe in any country over there because I had a classified clearance. I had a debrief agencies to everyone I talked to because of the wall being up in the war, which really was the Russian interface I just would say. When I ended that career, I joined development with Russia. We went into Russia, but 600 engines we launched defense allies with them. So that's a big change in 13 years. Not near as fast as what's happening today. It's like accelerating it dramatically. After aerospace, which I pretty much cemented my career and I dove off and I put in some dispensing systems for natural gas fleet vehicles, buses, airports, shuttle vehicles, small fleet. So we actually built the dispensing systems in the tanks that stored the natural gas and launched those in the market. So that was kind of my first taste of clean tech, still a part of a larger company, but was able to have that experience. Did a good job. Call me and said, hey, great job. You want to take a VP of engineering. I'd like to have a golden handshake out for a couple of years. That was a really easy answer. So my wife and I took our boat, checked out for two years, sold across the South Pacific. Left San Francisco, went south, spent six months in Mexico, crossed all the islands, great place to be if you ever can get there, and ended up in Sydney two years later. So little sabbatical part time checked out. Everyone should do that at least twice. You got a chance to do it, jump on that. It's a great opportunity. Coming back and I started, Jedu, founder, one of the three founders, formerly CEO, I recently have changed, I'll tell you about that in a second. And then in the last 90 days, I have joined a company by the name of Q1Nano, which we just rolled the name out Monday as Blue Solar. So the founder, John Argos, in the back and he brought me on to help his company. We've done a phenomenally good job with probably the best kept secret and technology for three years you've ever seen. I'll talk about that tonight. Jedu, we started a portable fuel cell company long before clean tech was ever even interesting for people. And you learn a lot of things and startups by hindsight. And I can tell you now, 2001 was not a good time to start a company. So when the stock market was going down very quickly and all the venture capitalists was kind of receiving back for two or three years, it was a very, very tough time to get a one hydrogen to fuel cell in three, 2001 to get something funded. But we got it done 18 months later. We got our first round done. And over a period of six years, we built an idea from kind of nothing to today, the last two quarters being considered the leading number one fuel cell company, portable space in the world. And that's not with us claiming it. So so happens the Pentagon had a neutral party go off and test all the products out there on the market every single one internationally. And Jedu list at number one. And consequently, the Ministry of Defense, I'm going to say the ocean did the same thing. And they ranked this number one. So we went from nowhere to one very nicely. And a large success, the company has a big name, absolutely. I sit on a committee. It's called the Hydrogen Technical Advisory Committee. And it makes policy recommendations to the Department of Energy, Secretary of the Department. And we sit there with Chevron and Shell and all these companies in Jedu. So it's quite amazing actually. It really is quite amazing. That picked because we sold more hydrogen products than in the world in the six years, slammed out. So the company in that position has a big effect on policy change as it relates to hydrogen, storage products or any other way they facilitate using it in our country. So that's the quick version of Jedu. Since then, I have joined a solar company by the name of Blue Solar. Very interesting space. Does anyone been tracking this but happened in the solar space? Anyone know? Big, huge, fast. Monday, this week, let's see the stats like this, New York, Listed Companies, Collective Valuation, exceeded $100 billion in solar by itself. That's not heard of. And that's doubled in like a year. So it's just getting absolutely exponential growth every single quarter. And there's probably not an end in sight. A couple of market dynamics are happening. It's causing that. I want to chat about that. I'll tell you what we're specifically doing in the space. We are working with nanotechnology. This is a nano, we termed it a solar brush, but it's an array of vertical brushes. And each individual brush and the ray is its own solar cell, standalone own solar cell. And to give you a size of how small these are, if you took a centimeter or something about this big, there's 10 million in the centimeter, 10 million solar brushes. And why is that advantage? Is because three main reasons. One is this particular structure in that array has captured the world's record for light traffic. So that's a good thing if you're in the PV market. That's a great thing. The other advantage is it uses less materials and most all other thin films out there. I'll talk about what that is shortly. The company's outside of West Sacramento. It currently has seven employees going to 12 by the end of the year. And we are working to close our first round of funding. So it's all happened very, very fast. So why solar? I mean, what I switched from hydrogen solar. Here will be nice niche markets for hydrogen for a while. Moving it around, having it compatible with codes and regulations and standards from counties to cities to states to federal governments is a challenge. And luckily, the federal government has not figured out how to regulate the sun. I'm sure it's coming. I'm sure it will happen. But as of now, they haven't done that. And if you look at the gigawatts per year, I'm sorry, one hour per year, the sun can produce versus all the other resources on earth is just obvious. It's 360 million terawatt hours annually compared to anything else up there. So I mean, how can you not do that? And it's been around for 50, 60 years. But there hasn't been much advancements or much investment thrown in the sector until last 18 months, $500 million. In just US, it's been $500 million in solar and just last 18 months. In just our country, that's not worldwide. It was unbelievable. So you've gone from total of 100 over 50 years to 518 months. So all kinds of things are happening out there. And a lot of countries and other nations are seeing the same answer. How can you choose to ignore this? We have to tap into this resource. And this is on top of this, it's extremely way to convert clean electricity. So if you look at the problem and what it can grow to in gigawatts hours, which is what this measurement is, 2005 was less than 0.0037%, which is not even a niche market. It's just kind of barely interesting. When you look at what Germany and Japan and actually California is doing, Germany said they're going to be completely turned into solar, renewable 30% by the year 2012, which is just unbelievable. They're ahead of schedule. Japan's doing the same thing. A big percent were going to be have it done by 2012. And if you look across the entire globe, as far as install capacity, how much and who has installed the most. Germany, Japan, California, PG&E specifically, which is an amazing thing if you think about that. It won't stay that way though, because you have Italy stepping up, you have Spain stepping up, you have the UK turning on some huge regulations. I'll just give you a couple quickly. They just passed the bill in the UK that says by 2016, any new structure will be carbon neutral, any new structure, no matter what. From now until then, the utilities will put 20% renewables in every single year. Otherwise, the decommission will take them off. So they're being forced to go to renewables and you have wind, solar, and a few other biomass, but it's majority of it, solar is getting installed. So if you look at the $500 million I talked about, it's been invested in the space. $375 million of it has gotten to something called thin films. And what that is is a way to reduce the material, to drop the price point down, at the cost of reducing efficiency. So you have about 17 new companies in the last two years, Jason Thinfilms, to the tune of $375 million. So it's a lot of investment dollars going out there. My guess is, my prediction is just started. It's not enough capacity. There's not enough supply out there to meet the demand. It's under somebody until year 2010. And even at that, that's been updated and that's moved to 2011. So ask yourself, what's different about renewables now than 10 years ago? There's a huge market poll. There's not enough supply out there and everything's getting bought up. Everything. It's an amazing story. It's happening very, very fast. So our company, what are we doing? This is actual picture looking down on our arrays, the probably billions in this picture, but we pull one bristle off over here to the right and that becomes its own individual solar cell standalone. So if that was damaged or it wasn't manufactured, there's some imperfections and it wasn't working. The other $9,999,000s still continue to work. That's one benefit. Some of the other benefits are because it's a vertical ray and the sun's coming up over the horizon, it's always perpendicular to the sun. So it puts out about twice as much power as the standard flat thin film or flat silicon cell has been out there for years. So twice as much power for the same amount of square area, which is a huge benefit. It allows to use about 90% less expensive materials than the best thin films to date and the ones that are coming. So there's a term in the solar energy called first generation, second generation and third generation. First generation is kind of the standard silicon panels you've seen for 50 years. Second generation is the thin films that are being invested in now coming out very, very thin and it's a way to reduce the material consumption and third generations are designs like this. So it's 90% less material than the second generation. So we're really leapfrogging the technical ability to put power out there for very, very low prices at much, much more, a larger power. Another huge benefit is it has the ability to, there's a term in the industry called multi-junction cells and it's very simple. It's a cell on top of another one, on top of another one. And the advantage for doing that is it captures the entire light spectrum. So it's the way to get up to the 20 to 25% efficiency range. The chart I showed earlier as far as the market size, that's a nominal probably 12 to 15%. No one's thinking anyone can get up to 30%. We think we have a very solid chance of doing that very quickly, which will resegment everything in the market and probably the solar will take more of the renewable space that can happen. And last, at the very end of all of this, as I mentioned, the active layers go very thin on the nano-brussels. But the space between the bristles is additional material savings. So it's very exciting. It was very easy decision when I was asked to join the company to switch over. The space has got some key things to it. It's exploding right now. All the supplies is sold for next two and a half years. They're looking for year 2009, 2010. So it's a great time to introduce a new product. There's not significant advancement yet. Everyone's just chasing lower costs versus higher performance and lower costs. And we're looking to bring a third generation product to market in about two to two and a half years. Any questions on that before I get off the solar sub-decal? Yeah. So what I refer to that was per square area. So light capture is up, referring to. So if you have the correlation would be a standard flat thin film, it doesn't produce power until the sun's about 10 o'clock from about 10 to 2. This substrate here would start as soon as the sun hit the horizon. So it has more time throughout the day. Yes? It seems like you have a lot of technical talent. You said you're a technical people. And then you really talk about technical solutions. Can you talk a little bit more about the role that you're filling at the company and perhaps the sub of the marketing that you have on board as well between integration issues? Yeah. Do you have any questions on that? We're technically focused and the question was how are the other skillsets in the company and marketing business development others filling in to help broaden the picture more than just technical, I believe. So currently we're seven people grown to 12 by the end of the year and of the seven four technical myself. We have a business development and a VP of finance. So the other three what we've done in the last 60 days is we kind of retracted the company for a second and we redid the entire business model. How we're going to roll it out, we're changing the entire strategy to look, the fill and we have put together a financing plan on how to raise the first round which is going quite well right now. And so it's all been about look, fill, branding and the business model itself and how we're going to finance the new model. That's what we've done. Which is incredibly important. It's probably as important, it's not slightly more important than all the technical work has been done. But saying that the company did a great job taking it for the last two and a half years, they did two things really well. One is no one knows about them, which is what I like. And the second thing is they've advanced it a long ways on their own dollars and all host science foundation money. So they've come incredibly far for what they've had. So now we're rolling the company out as ready to go to market, basically product ready to go to market for the first show of financing. Yes. So it seems like one of the big challenges for solar firms is to get past the stage making prototype manufacturing and get to that commercial manufacturing factory. Do you see a difficulty layer and how are you allowed to or where you at in that account? Yes, capital intensive. It does. And I don't have the answer to this question, but all the companies that have been funded are putting their own plans in. They're scaling their own manufacturing processes up. And to put a 50 megawatt plan in, it's about 25 to 50 million depends on which technology you're trying to bring up. It's very expensive. And that's just the equipment to put on the floor. That's not the labor, it's not the materials, not the buildings, just the equipment to build it. It's a science of putting very precise layers down with no flaws, very much like semiconductor, absolutely perfectly right and very, very, very thin microns. So we're dealing in nanometers, which is 90 percent thinner you would think it'd be harder. It's not, we actually are using a process, collector of plating versus vacuum. So we're going simpler and easier. And I know that sounds strange, but our substrate material, the way we have it set up, is more conducive for easier manufacturability and more precise. So we are going to put our own line in initially. We are looking at scaling contract manufacturing after the line. It's a way for us to control the processes when we first bring it in and to know the secret sources so we can teach others to bring it up under licensing. But yeah, it's capital intensive and everyone has done it the way you described it. Yes? One of the big issues for these technologies is that people will install, you know, all these kinds of solacellas, want to make sure that they can return, and they get the return on their investments, or reliability, the big issue. What kind of challenges do you face in convincing people that your device is quite reliable? There's a standard spec. If you meet it, you have to guarantee it for 20 years, and then every year they expect to lose a percent of performance. So whatever your model is putting out 150 watts, you can lose a percent of that per year going forward. But there's a very standard defined spec that if you hit and you qualify with some accelerate life testing, which is, you know, you run it 24 or 7, 7 days a week on the extreme cold, extreme heat, you pass that in two months. Everyone will accept. If you meet that spec, your guarantee will work. So luckily that's pretty defined. And that's one of the things I liked about the space. Because if you had to develop your own specs, and then your own certification process, year to year to year is very difficult thing to do. One of the problems with solar installers space today is that they have a little bit of difference, like, you know, as the way it's constructed is there are different panels and, like, cities, you know, connected in cities, and eventually it gets a bit inverted. Here, isn't it that since you are putting all these things in individual brushes, this kind of variability is at a lot of different cells, minimal increase, and that way, you know, the maximum power, which is the constructed out of the cells effectively will actually reduce. We still have the same problem. The benefit and advantage that we'll bring is if you have a 5 KW house or 5 kilowatt, you need to put up any roof for your 3000 square foot house, we should, and that consists of 30 panels or 40 panels, depending on which ones you buy, will be half the panels. Half the inverters, half the connections, half the wiring. So install cost goes down on because of the power output, but the question that you're asking will still be faced with, though. It is a problem, the standards of that, and there are much better ways to do it, which are examples of more startups to come, because some is going to figure that out, and it's going to be a huge market to tap into that, huge. I mean, the inverters should be part of the panel built into the processes where it needs to go. Figure out how to do that, bring it to market, you'll be rich quickly. Any other questions on that? Just interesting. How much technical knowledge do the non-technical number of the company know before they board the team? How much technical knowledge does the non-schooled member, as far as not being an engineer, is that what you mean? I'm planning to talk to people at four of them are technical roles, right? So about the other eight people, how much, how much feedback on knowledge do they know about the technical stuff that you're going to do? Well, I'll start with myself. I'm probably the highest level, lack knowledge. Everyone else is deeper than I am. I don't know if that helps, but if you talk to the one scientist we have, she'll take you ten feet deep and then start grilling from there. And no one really needs to go to that level. And there's various levels as you come up. But generally speaking, the entire company does not need to, my view is the entire company does not need to speak to the technical depth that everyone does. As long as you understand the functionality of product and be able to explain it a high level, so it's simple, and be able to finance, explain it, or customer, you're fine. And let the four to five people, the twelve, have the technical depth. How do you envision the energy planning and the planning is going to be more than five homes, or are you going to sell to other utilities? You know, the demand's so high right now. I'll just give you one example. There's going to be by the name of First Solar, dear to my heart, I want to be a First Solar. They did an IPO last year, 2006, they were $600 million. There were $10 billion. I mean, it's this start of a Yahoo story in Solar, it's unbelievable. There's so much demand, they sold out almost two years supply for $1.5 billion. And just modules. And they don't know where those modules are going, but all the power providers came in and bought it all up because they saw a huge shortage. So I don't know if we'll know where exactly the applications our modules will go to. You could go to houses, residential, industrial, go to solar farms, don't know. You'll probably end up selling through power providers, which are big organizations that come in, Financing Entire, Buy, and then Financing Entire install. They collect all the money to become the small PG-NEs, and they just let you have it for your surface or your house. It's become a very nice model if you have enough surface area to let them be interested in it. So, not sure where to go, but everyone's taking care of that very quickly. Hopefully overseas, a lot of stuff is getting shipped over to Germany and Japan, believe or not. So interesting times. I mean, if you looked ten years ago at Clean Tech, first of all, no one really knew what it was. No one wanted to invest in it, and no one really cared about it. If you look at it right now, every venture capitalist, private equity, hedge fund investment banker, that's half discussion all the time. It's on the top of everyone's mind. I mean, you couldn't find a more explosive spot for investment interest and a problem to solve. And the one thing I find very rewarding, if I, because I've been in this for a while, is at all levels, high up in government, you know, secretary levels, like reporting to push all the way down to assistance, all the way down to, you know, federal and state levels. Everyone's not only concerned because they want to make a good impression, but they're generally concerned about the global problems. They're concerned about global warming, they're concerned about resources, they're concerned about this thing not working. Okay. So, they're concerned about really, if you look at all the changes that are happening, it really falls in four buckets. There's climate change that everyone's concerned about, it's happening fast. There's oil prices, $100 barrel, 97, a little slow, but it did it. Population is just exploding, which is basically putting stress on all these problems. And then there's other resources that we make products out of, that's not oil, that are beginning to become in scarce. And that also start driving prices just like oil. Those four major changes there are creating governments to change, fast, which is unbelievable. The word fast and government going together. Investment thesis changing, company starting up, it's finding it fascinating that there's people in Europe, Italy, France coming over to the valley here, picking up startup companies looking for investment. First time ever is unbelievable. You look at our venture capitalists up and down San Hill, they're all going international, they're going to China, they're going to Taiwan. I mean, it's not a Silicon Valley thing anymore, it's much larger than that. And at the end of the day, we're all trying to solve the exact same problem, which is those four problems, creating a lot of opportunities for a company and people to have novel, unique ideas to solve them. So you couldn't pick a better time to even think about starting to come here right now, because investment is extremely high. A lot of people come from every direction, trying to solve a piece of one of these problems. Now is the time, it hasn't been better as far as interest in starting company and having success at it. Here's some examples of that. If you look at this, as far as adoption rates, if you look at this is just US now, look at the automobile to almost 100 years to get to 70 percent adoption, which is a very long time. I mean, investors don't wait 100 years to do that anymore. If you look at the next couple things back from that VCR to more of a vertical track over about 30 years, but you become all the way in the charts a little faded. I apologize for that, but you look at DSL or the internet within 10 years, it was saturated. I mean, that's the type of replication you want on a business model. You want to get something that works. You want to scale it. You want to start building revenues. That's exactly what's happening with clean tech and more so with solar. I mean, solar looks a little bit more vertical than that. That's happening across all clean tech products. I mean, nuclear, wind, all those technologies, all the products, anything you can bring to market right now, people are buying up as fast as they can just to help be a part of solving this problem. And so, you ask yourself, how you can compete against the big guys? How can you guys are myself competing against Sharp? That's how I look at that, right? Sharp, biggest solar panels supplier in the world. Well, if you look at some of the things in the past, it wasn't the car, it wasn't the wagon makers, I made the cars, right? You get in this paradigm mode and you can't break out of it. So the guys who build sharp panels are going to continue to build a really good sharp panel the same way, continuously to build it. But are they going to really take third generation, fourth generation and fifth generation seriously? Probably not. So it's meant for startup companies. I've seen that now for the last five years. It's very interesting. I'll just pick another one. I mean, some of the conductors didn't come from vacuum tubes. No one was even near that. And it was right in their backyard. It's a whole different way to solve the problem in a different paradigm. So that's creating the opportunities for young companies and successful startups. Another thing I like to think about is, you know, 10 years ago there was 70 million internet users. Today 1.2 billion, 20% of the world's population has been around that long. It's an amazing statement if you think about that. Amazing. Google was even around. Look how big they are. First solar was only worth 100 million, two years, 10 years ago. Now it's time to start your company. I mean, it's amazing what's happening out there. And then the solar space was nothing besides a very, very, very, very small niche market. And it has quadrupled in size in just months. So I predict that will happen across all the clean techs out there. And it is going to happen. It's been happening for a while. I'll continue to. A lot of people ask the question, is it the internet bubble happening again? I say not. The reason why it's problem is much bigger. It's much bigger problem that we're trying to solve. And it affects the entire globe with all the countries involved. So I think it's here for a very, very long time. I see it continuing on the race and then going for a while. Here's the example I have to use. We've been talking to Flex Tronics, which is a contract manufacturer. If you look at, you just go back 10 years ago, and all the contract manufacturers in the valley, the electron was the biggest by far worldwide. And Flex Tron was two, three, and four to pin the weight here, you check it out. And they went and bought the electron. Flex Tronics bottom. So it's not the big guys by the small guys. The guys can move fast. Fast ones are moving slow. And this is what they're facility looked like in China. In 1999, it had about 14 buildings. So they just entered the country. Five years later, the campus turned into a city. It looks like this. In five years. It's all happening very, very fast. Now, granted, a lot of those jobs are coming out of here. When you start coming up, you have to have an international strategy for manufacturing, because it's the only way you will mass compete. It's part of the business line. You just have to assume that. But that is the phenomenal growth in five and a half years. What's that look like in five years from now? It's going to continue at that rate if not higher. Any questions? Can you talk a little bit about the impact that well prices have and how low would that well have to go for really get back to for the over the next five years? You know, that's a great question. If you asked me that two years ago, I would say, if it did below 50 would be in trouble. But my answer now would not be that, because oil is just one of the factors out there. There's still the population explosion. There's still resources to policing outside of oil. There's still climate change. So I don't think the world is adopting renewables as fast as they are because of oil. It helps. By the way, when it goes to $100 in barrel, you see all the clean tech companies on the Wall Street go up. There's no doubt. But I don't think they'd go away. It may slow down for a moment, but you'd never notice it because it's not going to change the policies and regulations in Germany saying that we're going to be 30% solar. Just not renewable, but 30% solar before 2012. That's going to stay in place. Same thing with Japan. Spain's on board. Italy just joined. UK's doing something different, but almost as aggressive. So those laws won't go away. So I think the ball has start downhill fast enough that I don't think the oil prices is going to detract that much from it. Two years ago I had to give you a different answer though. $97 barrel doesn't hurt. Anything else? So the student wanted you to be trying to break into this case. What would it suggest they look for in terms of internship or what kind of company or where is the excitement going? Come see us. Like as soon as you can. I would say most companies that are just starting out once in the eight to twelve category are going to do a vertical growth of 30 and 40. And all my three clinked companies we had in her and it's every one of them. And it's a great resource. We love working with them. They add a lot and over 80% of them came back in a full time afterwards. So it's just a track record. You go and make an impression. We get to know the talent. They get to know us and it's a high hit ratio later. So that's why we like that. So seriously, just get to know the companies that are coming online. They're getting funded in the valley or elsewhere. It's a great source to really get involved in the industry. We could take the relationship like Moore's Law has for semiconductor as you have for solar panels. So the vast increasing as we go like 18 every 18 months or something like that. You know, I don't think it will be as aggressive as that. I think it could be something like every three years without with you know, not as much as change. I'll give you some prices. I mean, if you look at first solar, they produce their panels for a dollar 40, a watt. They dollar for watts of common measurement. And all the new players, there's Miss Lay from Kleiner Perkins, there's Nana Solar from MDV. There's literally 10 others out there. And everyone's chasing the dollar watt. It's the dollar watt magic mark to get below. We believe we'll start at the market in 90 cents and go right down to 70 because it's so much different. I think you'll see another four or five companies like ours, different solutions that will get down to 50 and 40 cents. Then it's going to get really hard. Because then your commodity pricing in, you're still going to use the same amount of glass and the same amount of aluminum frame. And there's only so much of that bill material, the ill effect. And the active materials can only drop so much with no matter how much you buy of them. So. The light or you absorbing all of this spectrum. It might be solutions that absorb more with higher efficiencies. The efficiencies is the biggest thing in the thing. For every percent efficiency higher, it's dramatically different solution. And everyone's racing. If you can beat next I app by 1 percent, everyone's going to buy yours. But if you beat them up by 5 or 10, you're going to resegment the market. That's the difference right there. So what's the comparable efficiency of coal or some of the other power sources? And is this going to become cheap enough in the near term that replaces some of the old dirty sources of power? So I don't have the exact answer because it's a really complicated question. I want to give you a gut feel. I'll answer it on a gut level. Everyone has always shrug off solar at the kind of 12 percent efficiency at Silicon prices for years, which has been very expensive. Been about $5 a watt for 50. I think the market's exploding at $2 a watt. I think if anyone ever got down to a dollar a watt and could get in 20 percent range, I think solar takes about 40 percent more market share from everyone else. And the reason why is the fuel is free. If you reduce the size, and you put on other structures, you can install costs less, drop price plan on the install and the other components with the system. And it's more applicable for everyone else. So you can make somewhat off grid. What's missing, what's really missing the big picture, if someone wants to solve this problem, please come see me as storing electrons. Batteries just don't do a very good job at that. If you're at how to store electrons as a night time, so when it comes back up in your solar panel, you can fill whatever storage device you have. That's what's missing. And an integrated storage solution. When that hits the market and there's about 50 companies working on it, it could explode it. It could be all over. So that's the missing link. Now, I know that you're talking a lot about this huge market opportunity and how it's exciting it is. You can see a lot of trends in that way. But yet, we also see statistics for California solar that are pretty scary. Like here, we had a natural gas fire power plant on campus. It's 50 megawatts. And solar in California last I heard was about three times back. So three times what we're generating here on campus alone. The solar shrieks times, the more it's staphers, what you're saying. Right. And that's where all of California is. But when you're looking at escaping up your manufacturing, you're mentioning your partnership with electronics. Well, that one partnership be announced. What do you think for the growth that you're planning or how are you looking at your hockey stick growth first? That's a really good question. I can tell you part of it because I'm on camera. But it's only good for part of it. It would be good for the buffer part of it. And there's going to have to be facilities put around the world to handle the growth locally, regionally. And how we do that and what that business model looks like is something we're working very hard on because that's going to be core to our company. But the flux piece is very important. Now you say, can they scale it up? I mean, the picture that was there's second go that one there can produce a lot. Okay. They say, this is what we got from a couple weeks ago, they can scale 300 megawatts in three months. So I say, if you can scale 300 megawatts in six months, I'm pretty happy. So it could scale nicely, but it's not the complete answer. And we were working the other part. It's a core piece of our business model that we're developing and having some of the discussions on. I'm not sure how everyone else will solve it, but we plan to solve it. Because I think if we can be that much better, we're going to have a demand problem. So we're trying to solve that ahead of time. Good question. Any other questions? We can talk about the solar stuff that came out of the mill. Yes. I can talk about the solar stuff. So we can do that kind of thing. Um, did you raise its third round of financing? And they have a number, a large number of military and development contracts to the point where they're turning some down. So they're in a growth mode right now. And I did decide to leave. I mean, I left in good shape. The financing was closed and the company was in, put away with starting to run their contracts. And I just made a decision because I think the growth in the sector is going to be here for a long time. And I think what Q1N had is something that's going to make a huge difference. And I'm making a bet on it. But yeah. Any other questions? You've got a lot of story in power. I was running it all with you. I was like, less than half over to hydrogen. You use more power doing that than the hydrogen provides. I've often looked at that. There is a house in New Jersey. And this is where the technology needs to go to. But I'll tell you guys, I did this. The state of New Jersey paid $4 million. And he put, I think, 500 KW of solar panels. He has five acres. And he has four electrolyzers. Okay. He put the power in the electrolyzers during the day to make enough hydrogen. He started in 14 takes of 100 in the ground. And he ran the fuel cells for the house at night. And then it was a complete cycle. It did that. So with enough money, it works. You can get completely off-grid and be completely renewable. Some day, that needs to be all integrated into one solution. But right now, if you look at electrolyzers, it consumes a lot more power than they make hydrogen for on the net. That's why it's not a popular solution. But there's a lot of companies working on that right now. That's one of the answers that could come to market that could just resegment it again. So there have to be other chemicals where you can just go top energy into the state. And that's why you drop it through the UR. Sounds like a company starting here. Any other questions? I just want to close with, you know, if you guys are thinking about starting a company or your own, you couldn't pick a better time. The world's changing so fast. I mean, I've seen more change in one 12-month period than probably the entire last five years. And I don't see it slowing down because it's one problem globally that everyone's trying to solve. And I think for the first time ever, they're taking it very, very seriously. So thank you very much. I appreciate you being invited.
