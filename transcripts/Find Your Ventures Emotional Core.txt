 You were listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader's series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. I am thrilled to welcome to Stanford, Susan Gregg Cogre. She is the co-founder and chief creative officer for ModCloft. This started out with her own passion for clothing and especially for vintage. And so in 2002 she and her boyfriend who became her husband decided to start a company. This company has devoted community of customers all around the world. And Susan told me that today she's going to focus on three things. First is finding the emotional core of your work as an entrepreneur. Second is embracing an experience and the rookie mindset when starting a company. And third is how challenges can provide new ways to discover new paths for venture growth. We're really delighted to have you here at Stanford. Welcome. Hey everyone. This is really an honor to be here. Thank you for having me. I heard that this is the last lecture series of the semester. And I know you guys are like going into finals. I definitely remember what that feels like. So I really appreciate you guys taking the time and coming out. And I'd love to answer some questions at the end. So please keep those coming. Like keep thinking about them as I'm presenting. For those of you that don't know about ModCloft, I saw that there were maybe a few hands that didn't go up. We're an online retailer of women's fashion and decor. We carry independently designed items and we design our own lines in house. We have about 7,500 items on the site. These are from designers based around the world. And I think that our customers would tell you that we have some of the coolest product that you can't find anywhere else. But I think they would also say that we are more than cool product. We've really built a name for ourselves in putting our community at the center of everything that we do. Which is pretty innovative for a fashion retailer. Like traditionally fashion is very top-stown. It's sort of like we tell you what's cool and then you buy it and you wear it. And then we tell you what's cool. Next week and then you buy it and you wear it. And it's like constantly the cycle. It's been like this very, like a lot of businesses have been interrupted by the technology changes that have happened in the last 10-15 years. Very top-stown, very hierarchical. And we've sort of flipped that pyramid. Like we've said that we want to put our community at the center of everything we do. We want to empower her to help us pick the products that we sell on our site. She actually helps us design some of the products that we sell on our site. She helps us merchandise them by taking outfit photos. She leaves really detailed reviews to help other community members find the right fit and enhance their shopping experience. And I could like describe our customer to you. And of like in demographics and psychographics. Like she's in her 20s and 30s. Like our age range is kind of 18 to 35. But it goes below that and it goes above as well. The average age of our customer is 27. But I think that a picture is worth a thousand words. So this is her. This is our community. Like this is kind of the best way to get a sense of what our brand is. And what mod club is. To give you a sense of our scale quickly today. We now have a team of over 350. We're based in three offices across the country. Our headquarters are here in San Francisco, which is where I live. Pittsburgh has our fulfillment and distribution. We do all of our product photography there as well. I'm a Carnegie Mellon alum. I'll talk more about Pittsburgh a little bit later in the presentation. Why? Pittsburgh is a city specifically on this list here. And our buying offices in Los Angeles. And our in-house design team is there as well. So I spend a lot of time with our team in LA developing and designing the products. And picking the products from the market that we sell to our customers. Another way to get a sense of our scale. Like these are some of our followers on social networks. Like we're one of the highest followed retailers on Pinterest. Think that probably makes a lot sense when you think about our community that has showed you. Like it's a pretty good fit there. Other than these numbers, like I'd say we shipped close to two million orders last year. Like it's definitely come a long way from when I started at 17 in my parents' living room. And I once spent a ton of time on this. But I wanted to just run through our founding story. And like how mod cloth came to be. You know, honestly, like I don't know that I was a born entrepreneur. Like I wasn't that girl that was like selling lemonade, you know, as soon as I could and like trying to employ my friends to like make an extra buck. But I'm absolutely an entrepreneur through and through. That's one thing that I would like love to share with you guys. Like if you could take something away from this. Like there is no right way to be an entrepreneur. You know, as I've gone through this journey and as I've had the incredible opportunity to meet so many other amazing entrepreneurs. Like yes, there are those born entrepreneurs who when you hear their stories, you're like, oh my god, like basically as soon as you could talk, you were trying to sell something and to start a business. And that's amazing and I really respect that. But you can come to entrepreneurism. You can find your entrepreneurial path in many different ways. And I think that I'm proof of that. So for me, it starts with my passion for fashion and just loving clothes. I mean, I'm not ashamed to admit it. It might sound unintellectual. But I've always like getting dressed. And it's always something that I was drawn to and I was passionate about and I had an eye for. I didn't have a ton of disposable income growing up. So I started shopping at thrift stores and vintage stores. Like basically I wanted to be able to stand out. And I wanted to be able to buy things that other people wouldn't have. And you know, the intersection of those two things, like a little bit of disposable income and wanting to stand out led me to vintage and thrift store shopping. I grew up in South Florida. I was suburb near Fort Laardale. And you know, I was a Florida girl. Like I had seen snow once. And when I was in high school, like I worked really hard. I wanted to not be a Florida girl anymore. I got into Carnegie Mellon. I decided to be a business major because you know, I actually didn't really know exactly what I wanted to do. But I figured like business maybe could lead to fashion. I honestly didn't really know what jobs existed in the fashion industry. Other than this concept of being a fashion designer, and I wasn't sure that I had the artistic skills to be a fashion designer. So I got into Carnegie Mellon. I had to move up to Pittsburgh and experience my first winter ever. Which is kind of daunting. And maybe you guys had an opposite experience coming to beautiful sunny Stanford from a place that was cold and snowy. But you know, for me, like I couldn't, I had to buy a whole new wardrobe and I couldn't do that in South Florida. You know, even if I had the disposable income to be able to go to the mall and buy everything brand new, there isn't winter wear or even like autumn wear in the malls in South Florida in the summertime. And so I started going to surf stores and looking for winter wear for the first time. And I found a lot of amazing stuff. And like I think that was kind of the moment when I sort of started to become an entrepreneur. Like that like seed started to grow. Like I was just like, I can't pass up these beautiful pieces of clothing. I know they're worth so much more than they, you know, kind of marked that just sitting here. Like maybe this was like my innate merchant coming out. And I just, I found myself buying stuff even if it didn't fit me. I would kind of say like, oh, like I'll give it to a friend or I will use the buttons for a craft project which would never happen. Or I'll learn to sew and I'll tailor it to fit me, which also has not happened. I still don't know how to sew. That's okay. But I was bringing all this stuff home, like trash bags, trash bags full of it. And I started dating the sky around the same time. He was, his name is Eric. He's my husband today. He's my co-founder at Modcloth. And he had actually started a web hosting business with two of his friends in high school. I would say he is more of that born entrepreneur, like thinking about running a business from, you know, age four or whatever. Like as soon as he could talk and kind of think about what he wanted to do. So he had this web hosting business. He'd built a few e-commerce sites. Like think about it. This was like 2000, 2001. It was sort of like, were these like young smart kids? Like let's help you get on the inner webs. Like it would go around to local business owners in the South Florida area and kind of pitch them on. Like we'll help you get, you need a website to like make your small business bigger. And so he had some experience and he was actually the one that suggested that I build a website and sell some of these products that I was finding. This like one of a kind, these one of a kind of vintage pieces. And I thought that it sounded like a fun challenge. I mean quite honestly I also thought, hey if I sell some of this stuff, that means that I get to buy more stuff which sounds really cool. And it's, you know, again like thinking back to that time, right? Like there weren't really any other options. Like eBay was an option, but I wasn't really finding designer goods. And I didn't really think I could like build a brand on eBay. It seems like if I was going to do it, I wanted to be able to control the kind of more of the customer experience and more of the shopping experience. And you know there wasn't Etsy, there wasn't, you know, any of these like easy to start up shopping carts. There was no Instagram to sell on. Like when I think about the entrepreneurs are starting today, it's like all you really need is a mobile phone and an Instagram account and you can be connected to, you know, you can be a tastemaker to a group of people that kind of look up to you and think that you have good taste. It was different then, which is kind of crazy. I mean I still consider myself like very young and I'm still like learning and kind of exploring the world. But then when I think back to when I started my business, like there was no iPhone, there was no Facebook. Like it's hard to imagine. And so I was gifted a digital camera for my high school graduation gift. It was my first digital camera. It was like kind of like a brick. And I used that digital camera and I used, you know, this all these kind of leftovers that I was finding when I was thrifting to launch the website. I also taught myself Photoshop. I taught myself some web design. I think I was using like, God, like Microsoft front page. It's like something kind of embarrassing. And my boyfriend helped me like hack and open source shopping cart. We used interchange, which was like a Linux shopping cart if anyone ever saw that floating around back in the day. And I spent that summer before I moved up to Pittsburgh, kind of like we incorporated. And I bought the first set of inventory. And I merchandise that inventory. Like I wrote all the descriptions. I thought the names. I designed the site. I thought about like some of the user experience of the site, you know, as much as we could kind of change from this open source platform. And we launched in January of 2003. And we actually had a sale on our very first day. It was not someone I was related to or someone that I knew, which was very exciting. It kind of felt like magic. And I think like that was so like going into the surf stores and seeing those products and seeing opportunity was the seed. Like that was like the moment when I like, I feel like I became an entrepreneur. Like I was just like, wow, this is really cool. Like I can go out and find this stuff. And I can like do all these things that I really like to do. And like people will pay me for it. Like that's pretty awesome. And if I could like, I was like just getting started in my college career. And I was just thinking about, you know, the things, what I wanted to be as an adult, the things I wanted to study, and the things I wanted to do. And I kind of had this like inkling of like, wow, if I could do my own thing. Like that would be pretty special. That would be pretty amazing. So I ran the business part time while I was at school. I continued to sell one of a kind vintage. And you know, it grew. It was like kind of fits and starts. You know, like some months it was really slow. We'd only have a handful of orders. I was doing whatever I could. I ended up being a double major. I had double majored in business and in German. So I had like a pretty rigorous course load as well. But like on spring break, winter break, like summer is like whenever I could, whenever I wasn't like, you know, doing other stuff that normal college kids do. Like I just kept coming back to this. Like I loved it and I was getting better at it. And that was a really good feeling. And so when I was approaching graduation in 2006, I, you know, kind of my junior, my senior year, I really start thinking about Modcloth as a legitimate career option. And it was a scary decision to have to make. And one of the things that I intuitively did that I would recommend to all of you guys, and it's like been something that's been really powerful in my life is like when you're making big decisions like this, and maybe it's obvious and you guys already do this. But you're making, if you're making big decisions, like sit down and really think about like what are the worst case scenarios and write them down and like get them out there. And you know, you won't get them 100% right, but like get comfortable with those. And then, you know, then you can go ahead and make your decision. That's always helped me. And this was definitely what I was doing at this time in my life. You know, I was thinking about like wow, if this doesn't work, like I'm going to be behind my peers, like I haven't gotten, you know, I was like kind of making these decisions of like, do I spend the summer working on the business or do I try to get an internship? Like where do I devote my time? That's like the eternal question for, I mean everyone, but particularly for entrepreneurs, where do I devote my time? That question will never go away. But I, you know, I really, I sat down and I said, okay, like if I don't get a job, like maybe, you know, people will look at me and say like wow, like what was she doing? She didn't get a job right out of college. Like it's all these things. Maybe I won't be able to pay my student loans. Worst case scenario, like maybe I will go bankrupt. I'm young, I don't have a family. That's okay, you know, like I like put that all out there and really thought about it. And, you know, it's scary, but at least like you know what you're scared of versus just like being afraid of like the unknown. So in 2005, 2006, you know, I spent a lot of time thinking about the business model. Like I knew if I wanted to, I knew that we had a lot of traffic. I knew that like new things that were happening on the web, like Facebook, you know, like a student at the time. So it was one of the first people to use it. You know, I saw the power of not just building an online retailer, but really building a community and allowing, like I realized that part of why customers were drawn to mod cloth was not just the fashion, but it was because they were similarly minded individuals, similarly minded women. And it's also opportunity to build a community, to build a lifestyle, to build something that was more than just about fashion. And that spoke to the spoke to customers and that empowered them to be actually part of the process, right? Facebook isn't fun if your friends aren't on it in the same way. Like I thought that I could build a retailer that would actually allow you to meet new people, meet new like minded people, get style inspiration, get style advice from not just like a fashion company, but from other individuals. There's also the rise of personal bloggers and celebrity bloggers and kind of like everyone was gaining an audience. And I saw this opportunity to build my brand and to gain an audience from mod cloth. And so I was thinking a lot about the business model. I was thinking about all this stuff that was happening at the time. And it's all the opportunity to, you know, not, I knew that I had to move away from one of a kind of vintage pieces. Like it's not scalable. It's not a great customer experience either. You know, everything is like in one color and in one size. But I really had no idea where to start. Like I wasn't a fashion person. I was based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, not necessarily the most fashionable city in the world at Carnegie Mellon, which isn't really a school that has, you know, a lot of people. Like I was starting to meet entrepreneurial mentors, but I didn't really have anyone in my life that had retail experience at that time. But I was eventually able to find, to find independent designers and to really make the business start to look like what it looks like today, which is, you know, this mix of products that, you know, some of them have a direct vintage inspiration, but really like all fashion is vintage inspired in somewhere and other, because it's like whether it's a dress from the 40s that then was reinterpreted in the 80s, that then is reinterpreted today. And it's just, you know, homelands are longer, shorter shoulder pads get bigger and tinier and kind of move to different spots. The silhouette changes, but it's all inspired in some way. So I was able to kind of take this business that started in, you know, my parents living room and eventually moved into this photo here in 2006 was our first like official fulfillment center. And then looking at today, like we're in a 200,000 square foot fulfillment center in Pittsburgh, you know, like I said, we're shipping two million orders last year. You know, we've come a long way, but another lesson that I've learned as an entrepreneur is that, you know, part of that drive will like that really drives you to start things, will never let you be satisfied. So it's really important as an entrepreneur, I think, to like work on the practice of like celebrating your wins and like taking a moment to step back and saying like, wow, we've actually come a long way. Because I look at this and I'm like, okay, we've come a long way, but we still have, I still have such high aspirations for the brand. I have such high aspirations for the business. We still have such a long way to go. And that's been like an important learning for me is like, how do you make it sustainable? How do you like celebrate these wins, but still keep that drive to want to get bigger and better? So I'm still excited to get bigger and better. I'm still learning tons of lessons along the way. And one of the biggest ones that I've learned thus far is that, you know, it's okay to be, you know, I'm kind of calling it like it's okay to be a rookie. Like it's okay to kind of not know what you're doing. It's okay to come at problems from a really kind of like rookie mentality. And that can actually be, it's not just okay, but it can actually really be an advantage. And I think that, you know, as I look back at my career and like my story at ModClaw, I think that it absolutely was an advantage for us in a lot of ways. Like I said, like we weren't retail veterans. Like we didn't come from retail families. Like this is a photo of me with our first delivery of, you know, non-vintage merchandise, like peaking over those boxes. Like, oh my god, what am I going to do with all these boxes next? This is like literally, you can kind of tell literally in our college house. And you know, like when I was going through this process, like back in this like really formative time, like 2005, 2006, and thinking about making this real business. Like, I literally had to Google like where do I find wholesale clothing? Like I didn't, I didn't know where to go and who to ask. And you know, it eventually like all my googling eventually led me to like some of the major fashion trade shows. And I kind of like bought a ticket to Las Vegas and went to these trade shows and like walked in without knowing what to expect. And you know, like I thought maybe it's going to be this like glamorous thing. I mean, you hear about a fashion trade show. It sounds like maybe it's going to be kind of cool. In reality, this is what it actually looks like. You're in the Las Vegas Convention Center. You're walking through, you know, it's kind of concrete. There's no windows. So this was what I walked into, you know, with this kind of rookie mentality. And I think the fact that I did just go in and like asked a ton of questions and was like, you know, like I literally asked about everything. I mean, I probably honestly was like asking some dumb questions. Like I was like, if I buy this, how many do I have to buy? And when will you ship it to me? And when will I pay you? And like some of these things that, you know, usually you know by the time you get to this level. And you know what I learned about the trade shows? Like really quickly, right? It's like the buyers go there. They walk the floor. Like everyone from, you know, small retailers like Moncloth was at the time to like the big department stores. They walk the floor. They look at the designers. The designers all bring samples that they're hoping to put into production. They see how many buyers are interested in the samples. And then they go back and they make some bets and they say, okay, this is, you know, we have some pre-ours for these and like these things. People were kind of interested in. So this is where we're going to, you know, kind of place our bets and like place our production orders. And so what I realized really quickly in 2006, 2007 is I was starting to like build out our design portfolio and move away from this one of a kind vintage model was that a lot of the items that I really loved weren't getting made. And so what I'd hear from the designers is like, oh, but Nordstrom bought this one. Don't you want this one? This one will get made. And of course, I didn't want the item that Nordstrom bought even if it was a great seller for Nordstrom because I needed differentiated cool product for my customer. So, you know, I kind of like I asked some rookie questions. It's like, hold on. You guys have all of these samples here and you're showing them to us and like just because I'm the only one that likes them. Like sometimes half of the items that we were finding at these trade shows weren't getting made. Like we had a really big fallout rate. So, yeah, I asked them these questions. You know, I said, we have all these samples here. Like I have all these customers that I can talk to like immediately. I don't have to, you know, wait six months and then walk out onto a sales floor like the traditional brick and mortar guys do. Why can't, if you have these samples here, you've already gone through the cost of making the sample. Can I just take those samples and see maybe my customers will really love it? Maybe I can help you get to that. You know, usually depending on the item, it's like a hundred to six hundred minimum production order. So, maybe I can help you get to that. So, I can guarantee my order and I can give you some real customer feedback. This led to our Be the Buyer program, which we launched in 2009. This is kind of like a quick snapshot of the concept. But it really came from this like rookie mentality of like why not? Why can't we do this? And I think like some people in the fashion industry kind of had this reaction of like, but that's your job as a buyer. Like that's the thing that you're supposed to do. You're supposed to go out there and like kind of, you know, make your educated guess of what the customer will like. But from my perspective, I was like, if I don't have to take that risk and I can actually engage my customers and let her let them let her be part of the process. Like wouldn't that be much better for everyone? For our independent designers as well, like this was giving them direct customer feedback rather than just getting traditionally they just heard from the buyers, whether why the buyers like something or not. So, giving them this like actual feedback from customers was a really innovative thing at the time. And this was a really important part of our growth. Like we were able to, for one, like get more items that we actually needed. Like I said, like half of the items were falling out at the time. And this was like the core of, you know, this like launched the core of our, our core tenant at our company that the we should really be empowering the community to help us make these decisions. Even these decisions that traditionally are made internally at traditional fashion retailers. I think that it's important. So, telling this whole story like I think it's also important as entrepreneurs to kind of keep in mind that fake it till you make it is totally valid like that concept, but it's just one of many tools in your toolbox and that's something that I've found as I've looked back in my career and you know as I think about what I would share with my younger self. I think that often we try to like just fake it till we make it all the time and I think part of it is kind of the culture like especially in the entrepreneurial world like you're just, you're always, you know, you're just like yes, of course I can do this. Of course we'll be able to hit these numbers. Of course we'll be able to, you know, we know what our plans are going to be one year from now to years from now, five years from now. And you know that's totally fine and like sometimes you really do have to do that like when you're when you're pitching your business, when you're talking to investors like absolutely fake it till you make it. But I think that sometimes like if you get too caught up in this mentality like you can, I would caution you to resist like, faking it because you might miss opportunities to actually find your own path and you might miss these opportunities to kind of put your hand up and say like why are we doing it this way? Why is it happening this way? Does this actually make sense? And this has been a really valuable lesson for me. Okay one last word on being a rookie. I will tell everyone out here. You know don't be afraid to go into an industry that you don't know anything about. I'll say like look at this girl if she can go on to be the creative lead of a you know well-loved multi-million dollar fashion brand like you can do it too. Even you know even if you're not raised in it it's not like in your blood or whatever. I think that I am living proof that if you're passionate about something like you can create your own kind of your own place in that world. Okay so this leads very well to my next lesson which is that it's okay to look back and cringe. I'm definitely putting those pictures up makes me cringe a little bit not gonna lie. I think this has been a really important lesson for me as a creative entrepreneur. I think especially as you start in your out in your career it can be really scary to be vulnerable and to put your workout in the world. You want everything to be 100% perfect and I don't think this is just you know when I say creative I mean like I'm definitely I spend a lot of my job and a lot of my time thinking about aesthetics and thinking about you know design and these sorts of things but I think this is just as applicable to you know if you're a coder or whatever you're doing whatever type of product you're building like when you're starting out in your career you are not gonna be good and you're hopefully gonna get better which means that you're gonna look back and your taste are gonna be better and you're gonna know so much more and you're gonna cringe on your earlier work. So you have to just like get out there and do stuff. This is one of my favorite quotes by the author Neil Gaiman like if you're making mistakes means you're out there doing something and I think it can be hard sometimes right like you want to just like you want to wait until it's absolutely perfect and I'm not advocating by any means that you should you know not care very much about what you do and not have real attention to detail but I think that this like having this permission of like no matter what I'm gonna get better and I'm gonna look back and cringe on my earlier work I think is really freeing so it's something that you know it's one of those lessons that's like easy to listen to and maybe to understand intellectually and it's harder to actually put to work in your life as an entrepreneur and something I'm still trying to work on and it can be tough quite honestly to find that balance of like having that attention to detail and not wanting to release anything until it's perfect and just getting it out there and like knowing that it's gonna change and you're gonna move on and you're gonna look back and you're gonna cringe one way or the other. So let's just take a moment I will show you my look back and cringe. This is the first version of ModClaw this is our first logo I think it's very clearly designed by a 17 year old who's just learned Photoshop yeah you know but this doesn't mean that like like I was really proud of this thing when we released it you know I spent time on it and I was thoughtful and you know I thought that this like embodied my brand and I thought that bevel looked really cool but I look back on it now and it's it's cringe worthy this is the next version of the site this was 2005 2006 we'd switched to a new another like open source like Linux based shopping cart but again it was like I had taken a few design classes it was like starting to get a little better but like this is some of the content that we were producing around that time I look back at it and I'm like oh my god oh it's horrible but I if I hadn't done it if I hadn't put it out there it wouldn't be where I am today this is kind of circuit 2007 2008 starting to come along you're starting to see some of the like kind of more of the hallmarks of the mod cloth brand that you see today for those of you that are familiar with the brand and you're starting to see more of like our kind of playful quirky aesthetic come through but you know again I look back at this you know in the work that I do today and I'm like likes you know and like I said it is it is about having this you know this is where we're at today and it's having this permission to to be okay with the fact that you know in 10 years you'll look back and like you'll be proud of what you did but hopefully you're going to be better and you're going to be past that stage in your career and your life and you're going to be you know on to greater and better things so the way that we think about like this philosophy and like putting into practice today at mod cloth is you know in one way like thinking about the concept in and our product development on the technology side of a minimum viable product and you know I'm sure you guys are probably familiar with this type of concept you know it's like think about what's the minimum that I need to put this out into the world and get user feedback on it so an example like a more recent example for us at mod cloth is our style gallery like this is a feature that we built we launched on our site in 2012 and like the two goals are you know let our customer come and upload outfit photos and like browse those outfit photos and get inspired and love them and kind of you know build a community in that way and then the second goal was to make those outfit photos shoppable and this was the first version that we rolled out you know we worked really hard on it we felt really good about it but you know since we got it out there to our user as we saw that she knew she realized that she should browse and she got the inspiration part of it but she did not get the shopping part at all you know so we iterated like released many new versions like lots of small iterations we found that just like adding this magnifying glass on the mouse over told her that she could actually click in and shop so it's like these little things and you know even though the first version of our style gallery failed right like we wanted it to do two things and it only did one of those things we didn't view it as a failure like we got something out there and we learned and you know if we had waited to like make it 100% to like like if we weren't diligent on really thinking about like what is that minimum viable product to get out there and to get feedback we would have probably spent a lot of time like running in a different direction because once you actually get things in front of your community and front of your users like that's where you get the feedback that actually matters and you know I think for us and for our brand like the fact that our customers were able to you know be part of this experience of iterating like she tells us what she likes and what she doesn't then she actually sees that we listen and that we make changes that's really empowering to our customers and that's like that empowerment is more than just retail it's more than just transaction like that is part of the I think emotional core of what has made mod cloth successful and I think what's made mod cloth like loved by our community as a brand and that's the kind of final thing that I really want to talk about today is that the emotional core of what you do like the purpose of what you do is an entrepreneur is really important and that's really what endures I think part of this is you know it's not just external it's not just that the emotional core of what you do connects your customers to you but it's internal as well like your purpose is what connects your team to the work it's what makes you know employees like an actual team an actual company it makes it's what makes everyone move in the same direction and I think that you know mod cloth like our purpose is really defined on understanding our audience like we know that you know if you ask women this study showed that 96% of women say that what they say that they agree with the statement that what you wear affects how you feel right and that's more than dresses like it's more than just a transaction and like being able to connect to that I think has been like externally and internally has been one of the most valuable things that we've done as a company so understanding so it's important to understand your audience and I feel like there are I when I've talked to other entrepreneurs about this you know I hear like what if I'm in a B2B business I'm not dealing with an audience like yours that has this sort of you know emotional need for product but it's not just about like I said it's not just about external it's about internal as well right and I think like when you think about companies that are that really endure and the people love and people love working at it's having a purpose that's more than just like we're going to grow quickly and we're going to make money like you need to think about and I have not come across a business yet that doesn't have some sort of emotional core that doesn't make people's lives better in some way that doesn't serve some purpose even if you are B2B like you're helping those other employees the other employees that those other businesses be more efficient to better at their jobs like there is an emotional core there and I think that getting to it is really important this is ours at modcloth we're committed to inspiring personal style and helping our customers feel like the best versions of themselves and you know it's it's different from you know I'd say it's different from the rest of the fashion industry and that you know we're encouraging our customers to be themselves and to be the best versions of themselves like we're not saying you have to become this like idealized like modcloth version we're just saying like we'll help you be the best version of who you are and this is really powerful like this is what are this is what our customers see from the rest of the fashion industry like each of these images is actually taken from a different retailers campaign I mean you see them next to each other and they they look pretty similar I think and there's nothing wrong with these images like they're beautiful and there's I mean there's like lots of good things to say about them but for me like I'm a customer and I look at them and I don't I don't see myself here like I don't feel like I necessarily belong and this is an image from one of our most recent swim campaigns at modcloth this actually this campaign went viral it was written about around the world we decided to photograph our employees and one of our best selling swimsuits it's a swimsuit that we carry in a broad range of sizes and that we've carried for years and years it has like thousands of reviews from customers of all age ranges and shapes and sizes that say that they love it and this is really powerful I mean like you look at this and like I mean I think this is a message in branding as well like if you or this is a message this is a lesson in branding as well right like if you look at these images even though they're from different retailers they kind of blend together this image is different right and it's important that like your business aesthetically kind of stands out as well but emotionally it stands out too right like this is a different message this is saying women look different and that's okay it's something that can be celebrated and that we can be happy about and it's also it's like this is the most vulnerable time for a woman probably when she's wearing a swimsuit like that's what we hear from a lot of our customers and it's saying like hey you don't it doesn't have to be that way it's okay and so I think this this emotional like I said like this is our emotional core for our business for all of you like whether you're starting businesses you're already an entrepreneur if you're you know just like you want to take these an entrepreneurial mindset to a bigger company like think about the emotional core of what you do like it really is important it's a lesson that I've you know I learn all the time like we get this incredible emotional outpouring from our customers because they see what we do for them how we speak to them and we see it on Facebook we see it on Twitter we see it internally on our site and like for me this is this is the like this is the thing that I'm most proud of when I talk about like what I've built at Lotcloth and you know I think if you can find something that you love to do that is you know financially viable right like you got to get paid for it and that also emotionally connects with other people that makes other people's lives better in some way that is really powerful and that's something that's like worth getting out of bed for and you know as an entrepreneur like I think that you have to have I think in some ways like you have to have that drive because there's going to be some days when you need something to get you out of bed like it won't be easy and this emotional core is also what gets you through tough times right and I think that you know a lot of times in the entrepreneurial world like we don't talk about what it's actually like to go through tough times like I feel like you hear a lot of the kind of overnight success stories and like I've had that story written about me in various ways you know like I've been on a lot of those 25 under 25 and 30 under 30 lists and you know like entrepreneur does this great thing and is like built this credible business and I'll say like you know at least from my perspective and like from the other entrepreneurs that I've met and I've learned about that concept of like an overnight success story just does not exist there's always something more to it and it's never just like flowers and rainbows and then I feel like on the opposite end of the spectrum like you do hear about I'll just pull one out of the sky like you hear about something like pets calm where it's like oh crazy explosion implosion however you want to describe it but you don't hear as much about the stuff in between like the actual like what is it like to weather hard times and I've been through that like the last 12 months at modcloth were not the easiest time of my life and part of why I want to talk about is because I do think that you don't hear other entrepreneurs talking about very much and I do think it's like part of it is the kind of the culture in the same way that I was talking about like we feel like we have to fake it till we make it that's a tool and it's not something that you have to do all the time and I think that yeah often like you know when you're in the valley or wherever you're at like you as entrepreneurs you start to equate like kind of your personal success and your personal worth with your business's success and your business's worth and I think that that is there's no way to kind of get around that when you're starting out because it is just you and you're you know it's you and like a very small group of people and you're putting so much of yourself into the business but as the business grows and as you I mean if your goal is to actually add more people you know it isn't just you anymore and I think that's like an important lesson that founders have to learn is it's not just going to be you and that's like for the good times and the bad times like the good times it's your team the bad times it's you and your team as well and that can be again it's one of those lessons that I think is probably easier to understand intellectually than to actually like put in practice in your life and you know for me over the last 12 months at mod cloth like kind of the long story short it's like we grew really quickly we had to make some tough decisions in the business because we were at a point where we'd grown quickly we weren't able to support our burn rate anymore and you know this purpose was what got me through making those decisions and like having those times where it's hard to get out of bed and it's hard to go to work that's another thing that's hard to face as a founder when you know you've created your own job and you don't want to go to that job that's a tough place to be in and I think if you don't have this purpose if you don't have something that's deeper that's pulling you back to it it'll be all but impossible so you know for us like I said like we had to make some hard decisions like we had to lay people off last year and it was the hardest thing I have ever done professionally and you know quite honestly like I felt I spent a lot of last year kind of personally feeling like a failure and that's a tough place to be in and again like this purpose was what brought me back to okay even though I'm feeling this way I can step outside I can look at this I can look at my business and I know that my business is a success because my business has this purpose my business has this you know this thing that it's doing like this is real and we're making a real difference in people's lives and having this brought me through that time it also brought our company through that time like this was what our team rallied around and it wasn't easy I guess I'd like we had to make some hard decisions to set our business up for success and set our brand up for the future and you know we decided to really focus on the things that we did better than anyone else in the world that was thinking about building community and taking like engaging with that community and creating products and creating innovative social experiences that they would love and that they would respond to and having that focus and having like this purpose to kind of drive that focus enabled us to you know kind of look forward and start thinking about the future and as we start thinking about the future of mod cloth like in the last like 12 months or so you know we knew that that involved taking the brand to the next level part of that is thinking about what a physical presence means for mod cloth and what that would look like and you know whether that's pop-ups or fit shops or guide shops or some combination of them brick and mortar stores we knew that was where we wanted to go we also knew that we needed to work on our own proprietary product so thinking about designing things that she couldn't find anywhere else because we know our customer best and we know what will fit her and we have all this like great data on what works for her so in order to do that we actually decided to hire a new CEO someone who had retail experience and who had kind of done all of those things had brick and mortar experience understood proprietary brands and our new CEO started in January his name is Matt and you know since January we've actually already launched our first fit shop our first fit pop-up we did this in LA about a month ago and it was incredible like we had customers community members lining up around the block hundreds of them some of them waiting for hours to actually get in and be able to try on our products and interact with each other and interact with the brands and you know I've all of this is possible you know like moving forward thinking about the future of mod cloth because of that core and that purpose and I think like it's part of why I'm so passionate about sharing this message with other entrepreneurs because I feel like it's easy to think about like there's just this kind of list of things that I need to do as an entrepreneur and I need to just check them off and I need to go to a business I need to do this and I need to do that and I'm not sure that like this concept is on that like well-known list this concept of like find your purpose and find what you're doing and I'd like it to be there I also don't think that the check off the list is like actually a thing that people should be doing I guess I'd like I feel like all entrepreneurs have different stories and like come from different backgrounds and kind of approach it in different ways but I do think this is one thing that like every business or to really like know where it's going in order to weather rough times and to be headed in the right direction in good times like this is probably like the most important thing that I would leave you guys with and I would love to answer some questions thank you for having me here today hi so eventually I don't get you look back and create the possible that your early choices even when you look back you feel that it's unsophisticated it fits the other people of that series too they actually prefer the scientific versions of styles oh so the question was it's okay to look back and cringe but sometimes you find that yeah that the naive version is better for a certain age group or like for a certain customer so I think I see what you mean and I do think there's definitely some validity to like I don't think it's about necessarily like looking back and saying like that wasn't cutting edge or that doesn't feel cutting edge because everything will feel stale you know kind of a few years into the future so I do think there's definitely validity to you know kind of like I feel like maybe what you're asking about is like a purposeful throwback or something that feels more I don't know kind of retro and I think that's totally valid I do think though that you know if you so if you feel good about what you're putting out into the world like part of the thing that I want to convey is like if you feel good about it like get it out there and don't just kind of sit on it and hold it in because you want to make it perfect because it'll never be perfect but yeah I do think that there's there's validity to looking back and saying like oh well this is actually great and it's like perfect again in this moment in time yes in the back um can you talk a little bit about the transition that you need between you know sort of feeling as simple as a small company and you're consumers and you know that they want your product and and that being able to actually empower those consumers like for feeling as simple as you to like being able to empower your consumers and like contribute to that cycle yeah so the question is about how what what what was the transition for mod cloths from going from like a purely transactional relationship with our community to actually empowering them to be part of the process yeah um yeah I think I mean I do think a lot of that for mod cloth story was timing for us like I said we were kind of I was like thinking about taking the business to the next level at this time where Facebook was really gaining traction and like all this stuff on the social web was happening so for me it like intuitively made sense that you know whatever business I was starting like this had to be a part of it like I looked at the way you know I was using Facebook and my friends were interacting on Facebook and it made sense to me that like because my customers were probably pretty similar to me and my friends that they would want to interact in that way as well and not just with the brand but with you know kind of each other on the website and giving them that opportunity was was going to be something that would be not just you know useful for us because we learn more about them but it would actually be a brand differentiator and I think the transition really was you know around the time that we launched our be the buyer program like having that kind of brainstorm of like oh yeah we could let's ask our customers let's get them involved let's listen to them it really was this like confluence of what we were thinking about what we were excited about and what was happening in the market like and in the broader like social world that allowed that to happen was that too vague or does that answer your question cool yeah I'd like to know do you currently have your own designers and also I'd like to know are you buying and selling globally and what's been your experience with that yes so the question was if we have our own designers which we do so that's definitely something that you know we see as a big part of mod cloth's future and moving forward is doing more and more proprietary design we release about 150 designs a quarter right now they're coming from our own internal design team and we see that scaling quickly the other part of the question was whether we work with international designers globally and kind of what that yeah both buying and selling so we do sell around the world our audience is mostly here in the US but we do have like a fairly substantial following in Canada and Australia and like some of the other English speaking countries that you'd expect in like high English speaking countries we do work with designers based around the world and it can be it's incredible from a branding perspective being able to introduce a designer to the US for the first time and bring them into a new market you know it's great for their business too and you know for us like it's part of how we've become known as a place that you know you can find stuff that you can't get anywhere else but from a pure like retail business perspective it can definitely be a challenge you know it's hard for designers that haven't worked with companies in the US before you know just like all of the actual logistics of like bringing product in and making sure it's like going to get through customs and going to be able to sell in the US it can be because we work with we really we really value independent designs we work with a lot of independent designers and some of them are really great at design and not so good at logistics and some of the other parts of their business we have to kind of step in and fill that role so I'd answer your question yeah the fashion industry it's really a cluttered and it's really a competitive space and I know a lot of the ideas they go over and out you see the craziest countries but I'm just curious what was the one thing that got the difference that got its idea about this? yes the question was what did mod cloth do differently to get early adopters and I think you know when I think back to the real early adopters like people that were joining the brand in 2006 and 2007 what we did differently was really go where our customers were at a time when other fashion brands weren't thinking about those spaces so being like one of the first brands to really build a fan page on Facebook for this audience going to you know up and coming like celebrity gossip bloggers and personal style bloggers because we knew you know we even like we used to do a lot of advertising we still do but like we do a lot of advertising with like cute blogs so like blogs that post pictures of like bunnies and kitties and that sort of thing which isn't fashion related so it wasn't like entirely clear to the broader industry that they should go and find customers there but we knew like I knew because that's the stuff that I was interested in and it was new and it was up and coming and like my friends were interested in it so we were able to go and like find our customer where she was at and I think that was definitely what really spoke to our early adopters they looked at us and saw us as you know in some ways like we were early adopters as well like we were the first to work with you know have partnerships with certain fashion bloggers and like be you know working with them to create great content that didn't feel like an ad but you know talked about the brand and like got brand awareness out there.
