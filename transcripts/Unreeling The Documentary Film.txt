 You were listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at edcorner.stanford.edu. Let's welcome Mike Leenan on and welcome back. All right, so I'm going to start and just take a few minutes to talk about my background and just kick off the discussion pretty much with a few thoughts that I had planned. And before I got started, I just wanted a show of hands for how many people are actually starting, started or actually running a company today in the audience. How many people are running a company and not talking about it? How many people would like to be an entrepreneur when you, okay? How many of you are here for some other reason? Because you like films or because you really don't care about for profit entrepreneurship, but you're interested in social entrepreneurship or movies or documentaries or other reasons. Okay. How many don't know why they're here? Literally. So what I wanted to do was I was just thinking about what I felt when I was sitting in those seats not so long ago, like Tom said. And as I was thinking about coming back here for ETL, I was thinking about what ETL did to me more than anything else. And the one thing that I remember is that it just taught me to think very freshly about problems and about what I'd like to do and about basically what I would like to do after I left Stanford. So I wanted to take a few minutes to share a few thoughts about coming back to Stanford at ETL eight years later and sort of what those eight years have been for me and some of the things that have stood out and things that I've learned. And obviously we'll do the same thing with Mike Lee and then segue into tapestries of hope, which is the documentary that we're working on. So the first kind of general thought that I wanted to throw out and obviously this is a discussion is one thing that I learned from ETL and a lot of Stanford experiences was even though you leave Stanford and you get a job or you start a company. And I was just really fortunate that right after I left Stanford, I was fortunate to meet a couple of amazing co-founders, Dan Turchin and Fatigue Nahata and start aero prize. Maybe some of you in here remember, a lot of you may have forgotten. 2002 and 2003 were not exactly the best years in recent past to start a company. And so in late 2001 and 2002 when I just walked to a lot of people and said, hey, I'm leaving Stanford and I'm starting a company, I didn't exactly get the kind of response that I wanted. A lot of people were like, you're doing it either because you couldn't get a job or it was difficult to get a job because you couldn't get a job you wanted or because you're just crazy or someone's brain washed you into this. And so what I wanted to do was a little bit later, I wanted to show you what sort of shape my thinking in the face of a lot of very unpleasant reaction and responses. So I wanted to share the story before I did of this company that a lot of you know and I'm a very regular customer off, but it's this whole idea of keeping your mind open to new possibilities and new ideas even if you're already busy doing something. And so the story goes that there was this company making washing powder, right? They were a market share leader in several states making washing powder and they did reasonably well. They were still a private company and they were family owned. And the family treated all these employees really well. And at some point this marketing guy came up with the idea to give this promotional item if people bought two packs of washing powder, right? So this marketing guy said, well there's this new nifty thing called chewing gum, right? And people can just eat it and if they don't like it they can spit it out. I don't know what you'd really do with it, it's not candy, but we could give it away for free, right? And maybe it would make people buy washing powder. And so that's what they did. And it turned out that people bought washing powder because they wanted the chewing gum. And suddenly people realized there's something going on here, you know, people who wouldn't normally buy washing powder are coming and buying powder because they want the gum. And so they said, well maybe we should ask them to pay money for the gum. And they wouldn't buy that much washing powder because we can't make that much washing powder. And that way they would go away and we will be able to sell as much washing powder as we can make. And then it turns out that people paid money to buy washing powder. And sorry, people paid money to buy chewing gum and then they didn't buy washing powder anymore. And then the company said, maybe we should sell chewing gum. And then that company we know as Riggly's chewing gum today. And so I wanted to talk about how, even if you're already doing something, it's a little bit important to just keep an open mind and not look at something and go, yeah, that's interesting, but it's not for me because I'm an investment banker. And I don't make money from this in the next three months. And a lot of what I got involved with is largely because even though it wasn't bread and butter stuff for me short in the short term, I just kind of remembered what it was like to be Riggly's chewing gum back in the day. And maybe there's a similarity in my life and a lot of people here. So the sort of other side of this with respect to social entrepreneurship is, a lot of you may know Shashi Therur who is a very well-known Indian writer, but recently he became pretty well known because he was the Undersecretary General of the UN. And somebody was asking him, you know, you are a fiction writer in India. And you're kind of this intellectual. And then why did you get involved with the UN? Because it's the ultimate bureaucratic organization and people kind of go through the grunt of being in the UN with the hope that over the long term they can achieve some social change. And his response, I thought, was very relevant to the whole Riggly story, is that you see a lot of what he called problems without passports. And you don't, you see a problem which can't be solved with one skill set and which can't be solved with one background and with one experience. But it's important to kind of jump into the problem with the background that you have, even though it really has no passport, you know, it could be a social entrepreneurship problem, disguise as a movie. It could be a chewing gum company, disguise as a washing powder company. You never know, but it's important to kind of look at a problem and say, I'm not going to give it up because the way I'm structured right now, I'm not in the best position to do anything about it. So I kind of wanted to leave that thought and we'll be coming back to that as we go through this. The other thought I wanted to share was, I was thinking about, you know, the past eight years and why I'm here and how those eight years have gone. And one of the things that jumped out at me was, you know, how those whole tapestry things began for me. And, you know, we'll go into a lot of detail obviously about it. But I remember, you know, a lot of how many have seen Blood Diamond, the movie with DiCaprio. So I watched Blood Diamond and it was probably, probably the best movie of last year, entertaining, well made, you know, very authentic about Africa. And I remember the movie was done and, you know, there's this, there's this line that gets repeated in the movie, which says, you know, this is Africa, you know, they say TIA and then they sort of understand what it means. Right? And I remember where the movie was done, I thought to myself, you know, I have no idea what that means. You know, it kind of sounds cool when two people say TIA to each other and they kind of know what each other means. And I was telling myself, boy, it would be great if I got involved with something to do with Africa. And then I laughed to myself and I said, there's really no way I'm going to get involved with anything to do with Africa. And I kind of laughed at myself and said, well, you know, maybe 10 years from now, 15 years from now, I should remember that I was really kind of, I really liked Blood Diamond and I should do something about it. And of course, you know, a lot has happened since then and we'll talk about that. But the, so that was sort of the second idea is sometimes things may happen where it has no direct relevance to what you're doing then. But the thing that, again, sort of maybe connect that with whatever happened next was that, you know, I remember my dad and I are really very close. But we never really have these long conversations and we're not, it's not a very emotional relationship, like most, you know, dad, dad, son relationships, I guess. And I remember the night before I was leaving India to come to Stanford, I felt like there was just so much going on because it was the first time I was leaving home and probably leaving home for a significantly large period of time, although nobody really wanted to talk about it. But I remember having this conversation with him saying, you know, I remember that my family essentially sacrificed a lot, you know, in terms of their survival and our survival. And they, what I remember they sacrificed the most was they sacrificed their ability to really dream really big, right? Because they were really concerned about what would that do to these guys? What would that do to the children? What would that do to the family? And I was just asking him, you know, did he have any regrets about the fact that they really didn't give themselves the ability to dream big? And, you know, we found ourselves in a situation where we were, you know, doing well as a family, but really what they were proud of was the fact that I was going to Stanford to study. And I remember one thing that he said, which, which again is very relevant to this situation, this conversation, is he was saying that everything that they had done, my parents and the previous generation, was so that everybody like me could have really big dreams and that it didn't stop us from thinking really big, because we didn't have to worry about survival. And I always told myself that if I want to fail, I want to fail really big. I don't want to fail because I dreamt really small and that that didn't matter. So in terms of sort of how I thought about every project that I got involved with, I'd rather go for broke and then fail big, rather than saying, because I'm very unlikely to succeed, I'm going to think of something really small to do, and convince myself that I can do that and succeed at that really small, you know, goal that I had. So again, that was, that's a theme that will probably be revisiting. And in the interest of time, I'll just move on to one, one other really, sort of core theme of why I'm really happy to be here. And before that, if we can get all this going, I just wanted to segue into, I wanted to play just a little slide set and then we'll come back to my third point. I kind of just wanted to leave with the final thought that, a lot of times people, I mean, again, to the earlier point about the size of the dream that you want to have, if the goal is to catch a big fish, if the goal is to go after something big, there's really no point in trying to swim in waters that are really shallow. So, you know, I think it was a David Lynch idea that the whole notion is, if you want to solve a problem at a certain level, or whether it's business problem or social entrepreneurship problem, it's really important to take it on at a very deep level, because otherwise, you know, the problem and the solution are both shallow, and I don't think, you know, it really makes a huge difference. So, with that, we can move to my clean spot. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for coming tonight. I know you've both met Tom and Deborah, but I think one of the things that we all realize tonight is how all of us connected through Deborah. And one of the things I will talk about later is how critical connections are. And in fact, through a Facebook connection, I believe that my life was saved in Zimbabwe. So, we'll talk a little bit about that, and I'll give you just a brief background. I come mostly from corporate America. I spent many years down in Hollywood with Disney, Ambulin, Hollywood Pictures, Mattel. And I came up here to run Sega's Entertainment Group when they were at the height of the video game business. And then, at one point, I sort of came to the realization that, in corporate life, at least at that time, we never asked ourselves the question, should we be doing this? Yes, it'll make us a lot of money, but, you know, what's the impact of what we're doing? So, that's part of why I shifted into New Gear and went out of my own. At that point, I worked with Nike and IMG, and I did a lot of sports licensing deals. I did a lot of technology deals and application technologies and video games. And then, truly, decided that I needed to work for my heart. And I did a film called Flashcards. I did a short film called Flashcards that won a number of awards and screened at the Con Film Festival. And the idea behind it, which is really the cornerstone of what we do with Freshwater Spigot and what I'm doing with Anand, is you use film as a way to change the world. We're going to tell you a little story here. I'm going to have Anand write a few things on the board. Can you just write those three? Anand's going to write a few things on the board. And the key thing, whenever we decide to do a project, is three questions, you have to tell a powerful story. How do we tell that powerful story and create global awareness? And most importantly, how can you create change? So, after I did this film called Flashcards, we did a national curriculum on child sexual abuse. And we couldn't get that curriculum anywhere in the United States. So, we actually had word from the Canadian Mounties and Canadian law enforcement and the curriculum is being used in Canada. And then it also was being used in Africa, in many parts of Africa. So, let's see, I guess it was last February. There was a woman night heard about in Zimbabwe, Betty McConey. And Betty, for those of you who don't know the situation in Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe has been ruled by a dictator for the last 28 years. Initially, he went in as a freedom fighter and then became corrupt and actually basically turned the country into a great deal of poverty and destruction. Has anyone been following the news lately on Zimbabwe? Any of you? Okay, so they've just had an election recently. They were hoping to house President Mugabe. Most people believe they did oust him, but he's refusing to relinquish power. And that's sort of the backdrop of what's going on in Zimbabwe. We ended up wanting to do this film on, called Tapestries of Hope. And the powerful story we wanted to tell was this woman, Betty McConey, who's over in Zimbabwe. In Zimbabwe, men have been counseled by their traditional healers, which is similar to a shaman here, a Native American culture, even Western doctors. They've been counseled that if they rape a virgin, they will cure their AIDS. And so not only have men believed this and infected young children with AIDS. And now Zimbabwe is the number one AIDS capital of the world. So not only are young girls being raped to cure AIDS, but actually these young girls contract AIDS and give them to their children as well. So you're seeing three and four generations of AIDS victims based on this myth that if you rape a virgin, you'll cure your AIDS. So Betty McConey is this woman who born and raised in Zimbabwe who actually is on the ground. She has a core team of people she works with with the Girl Child Network. And her role is to go out and save these kids from rape and abuse. And frankly, in a third world country, she does a far better job than we do in the United States. And I'll tell you why. She actually has this core team. There's a team that they she calls Mr. Rescue and his team. And they go out in these big white pickup trucks and they actually get text messages about a child who's being raped or whose grandfather believes that if he rapes her that he will cure his AIDS. And they literally go out and pluck the child from the environment. And so this woman and her team put their life at risk every single day. So when I had heard about this, I had no desire to go to Africa. I had a different idea, but I always ended up with parasites every season. I said, no, but I'm not going. And there's a woman, Paula Genturko, who's a photo journalist. And she has a book out now called Women Who Like The Dark. And Betty McConey is the very first chapter in the book. I think it's here at Stanford. I believe Paula has spoken here before. But it's really worth taking a look at it because it's people around the globe who are making a big difference. And so eventually I ended up, I had called because Betty McConey was coming into town and discovered that I'd love to go here or speak. And when I called the local nonprofit group, the next thing I know I was having lunch or having breakfast with Betty. And after Betty and I talked, the rest was kind of history because I knew what she was doing. And I was so inspired by what she was doing that I thought we needed to go over and tell the story. So we went over last August in film for a week. We actually sat down with the traditional healers. We talked about why they councilmen to rape virgins. We had probably about 35 stories from the young girls who were raped or sexually abused. And then we watched what the girl child network did on the ground. And one of the things they do there, which was so staggering because it's so simple and it doesn't cost any money. Which is when a child is traumatized, they actually, the first thing they do to a child when they bring her in is they say, how can I help you? It's not, here's what we know is good for you. Here's what we need to do. In our US culture, we basically say it's mandated by state and federal law. If the child is abused, you automatically take them from their environment. So we don't ask them a lot of questions. We just take them from an environment and put them into social services. And their chances of being abused and neglected are three times as likely. So what Betty does literally is how can I help you? And just by that little thing, they actually re-empower the child. So one of the worst things about being abused is you are not empowered. You are powerless. And so what she does is gives them their power back. And the length of time it takes for a child to heal is shrunken dramatically. You'll see in the trailer, you'll see a little three-year-old girl who had been raped at two and thrown into a garbage dump. And when we saw her, she was an amazing Brazilian child who really had recovered from what happened to her. I see women across the country here who still haven't recovered and men who still haven't recovered. I should say that there's not a lot of abuse of men going on in Zimbabwe or boy children. You know, thank God. And that regard is probably, you know, it's not even measurable. So that's the reason why the Girl Child Network, and she's actually created the Boy Child Network as well. So boys can help change the myth that's going on there. So after a week of shooting, on a Monday morning, we were arrested by the Central Intelligence Office in Zimbabwe. There were 15 Central Intelligence Officers, much like the CIA, who arrested us and took us for interrogation. We actually spent the day being interrogated, and then they let us go home, which in Zimbabwe, in the prison system, there's no food, there's no water. And they wanted us to go home and eat and then come back in the morning. And for any of you who have grown up here, you know that if the police let you go home, you figure, well, it can't be that big of a deal, right? So we're going home, we'll go back to get our equipment in the morning. And what happened the next morning is we went back in and they started interrogating us all over again. But I had the, the wherewithal to email Anan the night before. And I said, Anan, if I start calling your phone and just hanging up on you, know that I'm really in trouble. And so the next day, as we were getting fingerprinted and my husband had already hired human rights lawyers, or the US Embassy was involved, but no one could see us. And I started calling Anan on my phone and hanging up and hanging up. And the trick was to make sure he knew that we were in trouble without letting the police or the Central Intelligence Officers hear me. And I was making this furious notes. He was making furious notes. And you were yelling to Lauren. Yes. Well, what had happened is I wanted to make sure, once I got him on the speakerphone, I pretended I was talking to Lauren, my assistant, who was also there in Zimbabwe with me, so that he would know what to do. And at one point it was very quiet in the police station. I hear Anan go, what do you want me to do? And I'm, oh God, here he is in America. And I don't, you know, it was a very difficult situation. So Anan and my husband and a number of people here were trying to get us out of jail. And we were quite surprised. Betty McConey, who is a born in Raisins in Zimbabwe, was not put in prison with us at night. We went alone. And I think it was partly because Betty's work is so powerful there, and she's become such a public figure, that they were worried about the backlash of imprisoning this woman who saves these children. So we ended up a little overnight in a third world prison and a five by five cell with eight women. And you want to talk about being inspired. These women, all of them, were there because they were trying to feed their children. In Zimbabwe, it's illegal to sell food on the street. And truly, there's not a lot of food in Zimbabwe. So what they would do is they would jump over a border. Zimbabwe is landlocked, and they would jump over to one of the other borders, bring food back and sell it so they can feed their children. So all of them were going to get out and go right back to prison, because it was the only way they were going to survive. And at one point, I said, at one point in the night, I actually heard all of their stories. One of the women was involved in domestic violence, and she was carrying photos of herself. She had been so badly beaten that from the photo, you couldn't recognize who she was. And I started crying, and sort of the leader of the group said to me, why do you cry for us? And I said, I was kind of staggered by the question, why cry for you? Because your life is so bad. And she said, no, no, no. Our life is okay. We will survive. And what was so inspiring about that is they had so little, and they didn't have any higher expectations. And they truly, I found, as a whole, were much happier than most people I know here in the United States. So eventually, I'm benounced to us until I got back. We did get out the next day. We were deported to South Africa. And it wasn't until I got back that I realized, and I say this to everybody, don't underestimate the value of Facebook, because it was the gentleman that who became part of our core team early on, a man out of Greece, who of course we had never met, who, when I got arrested, Anna had put a little note on her website and taken down all my blogs. And he had called a friend of us at the CIA and got us out. So not it was because of him that we got out and that we got our film out. So it is a great example of those connections out there that you may not realize how valuable they are. And they truly, he saved my life. So we are in the middle of editing this film. And one of our key goals, and we've worked with Professor Cosmic's class in Gem on creating viral campaigns, creating marketing campaigns, because our goal is to create global awareness of this issue. And of course, eventually create change. So one of the things we also talk about, besides the opportunities in asking those three questions about what project we do, is we ask some challenges. And we'd love to talk a little bit about the challenges we've had raising money for this. So under challenges, we talk about raising money. How do you talk about an issue like this that makes people so uncomfortable? And how do you move them from discomfort to action? And the social consciousness aspect at versus commercial viability. Again, that's another. How do you make a film that can raise awareness, but can still create a profit? So Anand, do you want us to talk about raising money a little bit? Yeah. We should probably be out raising money. Yeah. Well, one of the things that, again, speaks to the earlier idea is, when we went out to raise money for this project, we met people all over the entire spectrum, from people who are doing 100% social entrepreneurship projects, and they work for charity all the way to someone who invests in romantic comedies and in horror films, purely within tend to making money. And so we met everybody on both extremes and everywhere in between. And I think the biggest question, when for me, every project that I had raised money for, or taken out to raise money for, before tapestries, you could fail, obviously, but you could look the investor in the eye and say, well, if we did well, you could make money off of this. But really, if there were two or three investors who said, well, I totally trust you, you're doing a great job with this documentary. But can you look me in the eye and tell me that I will make money off of this documentary? And the honest answer is, I don't know. If you want me to say either yes or no, I'll say no. But the honest answer is, I don't know. And that raised a whole bunch of challenges for us, in terms of saying, who are we? When we get this movie done, are we going to go the commercial route? Or are we going to go the social entrepreneurship route? And many films have taken one and the other very successfully. But I think that we saw a lot of successes in both fields, where they had left a lot of opportunities unexplored, because they hadn't thought about it completely. An example is, we got a chance to meet a couple of people who are very closely involved with this documentary called Born into Bratels, with some of you may have seen. It came out in 2004. It was a very competitive year. And those of you who are Oscar nominee fans and documentary movie fans, you'll know that 2004 was probably one of the best years in the past 20 years or so for documentary films. But this movie came from behind to just win the Oscar that year. But what they did really well from a film standpoint, they set an amazing story. They told a very powerful story. But when people watched the movie and with all the attention that they got, they weren't able to translate someone watching the movie and going, I'm inspired by this. I'm moved by this. What can I do to help? There wasn't a very straightforward way to say, here are the three things that you could do that could make a difference. You don't have to go and get yourself arrested, but you could do something. And you know what Anand says here is probably the most critical mistake people make, either in profit or non-profit in terms of what can I, when I get people inspired, how can we give them a step to take? Yeah. So that's probably the biggest challenge that we're facing. But I think we're trying to solve a problem that we're solving from multiple angles. And so there aren't too many case studies that you pick up and say, this is how you do it. And so a lot of the trade-offs that we are facing are trade-offs largely because something like this has not been done in this context before. And so there are a lot of people who, you know, for instance, when we when we spoke in Tom's class late last year, a couple of people came up and said, well, I'm actually moved by Africa, but I'm not moved by Zimbabwe. So what would you like me to do? Would you like me to still donate to your cause or get involved? Tell me what you would recommend that I do. And the honest answer is that if it moves somebody to donate to some cause that is worthy, I think we may have already accomplished, you know, as much or more than we started, because the key is to get people to say that even though this may not be what I think about every day, I can still play a little part in doing something about it. You know, if someone who sold wireless software for a living can do this, you know, anybody can, can, you know, can easily get involved. So that was our biggest challenge raising money and, you know, the tradeoffs with social consciousness versus, you know, the commercial salability. I just want to add one, a couple things. So we realized that we had a tough challenge raising money. So we did a couple of things that were critical. We actually set up a nonprofit and a profit. So people could, who were interested in looking at ways to do simple donation that they could get a write-off for. And the other part of it is people who'd say, geez, you know what, I'm willing to take a risk on you and I'd love to get involved in the upside. So we gave two opportunities. And then in addition, what we decided to do is there's a, how many of you know Indie Go Go at all? Anybody? Okay, there's a number of new models or new prototypes to raising money for films or projects to create social change. And Indie Go Go came back, came to us actually back in December and said, we've heard about your film and what you're doing and we'd love to participate with you. So what they did is we just created a link to them and we talked about what we were doing. And as of today in the three or four weeks, we've been involved with them. We've raised $20,000, which I didn't know if you knew today. We hit our second mark. So what we found is instead of going to the traditional distribution models, we've gone right out to the people who, it's not about, you know, picking the movie to watch, it's picking the movie you want to see made. And I think that that's helped us a lot. And we're always looking for that. The viral aspects of Facebook have been great to get awareness out there. Even the Stanford relationship has helped us in many ways. But one of, and American Idol's a perfect example of, wow, what a great way you can create, you know, raise a lot of money. But I think it's a very different, American Idol is a very different example because it's such a powerful audience, it's such a powerful show. And I have not seen a lot of viral efforts create money. You can create viral efforts, but where do you get the funds raised? Well, I think there was, we had one other sort of category where we wanted to talk a little bit about just our experiences and how this has changed us. And what it has made us sort of, you know, think more about that we hadn't thought as much before. And I wanted to talk a little bit about something that we did in the movie, which I think is a very important part of the movie. Largely because, you know, my friends humble and won't talk about it, is we, when we started making the movie, we essentially went in saying that we're not going to make this movie about Americans making a movie about Zimbabwe. What we wanted this to be was just the story of Betty McConey and the girls of Zimbabwe and the issues that they face. And, you know, we shared a lot of, a lot of you might have read Mark Tully, you know, he worked in India and he was a BBC editor. And one of, one of the things that he said in his book was about how it's very tempting for the journalists to make themselves a part of the story that he or she is writing. And so we started off saying we're not going to do that, you know, that's the limit that we draw. And then when, you know, prison happened and Zimbabwe happened and they came back, the rest of us basically sat Michaeline down and said, well, the movie has changed quite a bit. And it's largely that the making of the movie became part of the movie. And as we looked at that a bit more with Michaeline's history in child activism and, you know, as an activist in general, and the fact that she made her previous movie flashcards on child sexual abuse, what we realized is just like Betty's doing her bit to fight child abuse in Zimbabwe, Michaeline has been doing her bit to fight abuse in the states, you know, in her communities. So from our standpoint, it changed us significantly where what we went through and what the experience did to us quite against our wishes became a part of the movie. So to us, that was a huge change in terms of sort of the structure of the movie and the treatment and how it laid out. And it did delay the movie a little bit, but I really feel like it, I identify, people identify with the movie a whole lot better as a result of that kind of massive change. So, we still agree to disagree. And we would love to talk just a little bit about what you can do if you're interested in helping and I know we're going to open it up for Q&A and then show the trailer afterwards. So do you want to talk about a couple things people can do if they're interested? Yeah, so we wouldn't be doing our jobs if we didn't finish with this. So essentially, you know, if you want to get started and just get involved, we have several groups online, you know, we have a blog, we have a group on Facebook, just become a part of the community, join the group and you will give you updates as and when something interesting is going on. And that's easy, you can do it, you don't have to go back and do anything. The other thing you could do is spread the word, there may be either an organization that could help finance the movie. We're very close to getting the movie completely financed, but if someone is interested, we definitely like to talk about the project with them. So if you know someone who's interested in either the social entrepreneurship side of it, because they're involved with the cause in Africa and they'd like to talk to us about what we're doing on the social entrepreneurship side, that's great. But if they are, you know, they're interested in funding documentaries. And there are a lot of people who've done that. If you know somebody, definitely have have them talk to us, we'd love to reach out. The other thing you could do is, like Michaeline said, you know, we're on IndieGoGo and a lot of people are sort of saying this movie needs to be made and they're literally putting their money where they're mouth is. So you can get involved with IndieGoGo and, you know, get the movie made. There are several different levels at which you can get involved. So you could do that. There are a few people that got involved with the project at some level who are coming to work for us in the summer. A couple people in the audience, Kasmir and a couple others. So if you would like to come work with us, that's great. We can find something that you can do and, you know, it'll be an amazing experience. And in the next year, there's a good chance we'll go to some of the top festivals. You know, Sundance, try back, maybe San Francisco. And so it'll be a great experience for you to get involved with that. But also, you know, Michaeline was invited to the UN to talk about child abuse. So there's a good chance we'll show the movie at an outlet like the UN. So whichever angle kind of inspires you, we'd love to talk to you about getting involved. Coming up, we have lots of jewelry that you could give to your mother and all the proceeds go to the young girls in Zimbabwe. So with that, I think we'd love to open it up for question and answer and then show the trailer. Any questions? I want to come back to what you said and I was one of the really different problems that you go to a sort of a standard sort of capital. And you say, oh, if you do well, you know, we'll make money. So in this case, you didn't have a satisfactory answer. Did you were you able to come to eventually an answer or were you able to find a different kind of investor that was okay with, I don't know, or some other value that you've been offered? Well, so there is a, so statistically, the top 0.5% maybe of documentaries every year do make money. So the goal is, you never know what other documentaries are getting made every year because you're so deep in the trenches making this film that you don't know what Michael Moore is working on. Essentially, and essentially Michael Moore is making a movie or Errol Morris is making a movie that movie is going to be the documentary that attracts most of the press and the money and the attention and audiences. So you really have no idea what else is going on out there and especially now, it doesn't cost a lot of money to make a good documentary. So there are a lot of people who are not based in the US or who are not even documentary filmmakers who are making good documentaries. So it's a little bit like we're living in the YouTube world, right? So standards have come down, costs have come down, and so it is a lot easier than you think to make a documentary. And it's also quite easy to make a good documentary. And of course, the best documentaries are obviously really, you know, in a different orbit, but, you know, so ignoring them for a second. So statistically speaking, it's not very easy to make money on a documentary. So you're not only counting on you doing a great job, but everything else that's going on. So what we look for was just investors that were okay with that uncertainty and still believed on the social side of what we were doing. I think you really have to tap into the heart of people and it has to be something they're passionate about. Absolutely. And I find certainly if you show the stories of the children, it's very hard not to be moved. Yes? What kind of numbers are we talking about for complete production? He asked what kind of numbers are we talking about for complete production? Actually, this film, when completed, will probably cost us roughly about $250,000, which is very, very cheap on the documentary side. We actually just had a donation for a complete post-production on this, including special effects and animation, which in itself is worth a great deal. So we're very, very close. And we expect to be done by August. Other questions? Yes? The last of your three bullets is create change. And you're certainly doing a great job of creating global awareness. What's the change? What's the takeaway? Call the action that you want from the movie? And is it something that we could implement right now? Good question. Did you bring your checkbook? She asked what could we do now? What's the takeaway from this project and what we could do right now to create change? And I think the net net of everything we're doing is we want to create global outrage. So yes, you can. You can start virally spreading this and say, look, you know, you'll see in the little trailer, you know, we're not, we're talking about young girls, but we're also talking about infants. We're talking about one day olds that are being gang raped. And if that doesn't hit you and tell you, my God, I want to help stop this, then probably nothing will. So how you can help us start spreading the word. And we hope, go ahead. I had another, I mean, from what Betty was saying last week, the important point though is like people like, you know, the girls of the GCN, everywhere, they don't need anybody's mercy. You know, they don't need anybody's sympathy. They're mostly happy. I mean, they're good to go, but they just don't have opportunity to do most of the things that they want to do. So when we say, let's donate some money, you know, a lot of times Betty says that her job is in danger, not because Mugabe is going to take it out of power, but some girl will do so well that she'll want to be the director of the GCN. And apparently the girls come to her and say, we don't want to be the directed anymore. We want to be the director of the GCN. So they, they're as ambitious as anyone at Stanford, anyone in the States, you know, anyone with an Ivy League education. All they need is kind of access to opportunity. So what we're looking to do is sort of go beyond the, oh, the poor children of Africa kind of mentality. And sort of say here are specific things that you could sort of get involved with and either donate to or, you know, help make the movie. So that, so the reason we chose mass media is because Betty could go around and talk to small groups, but the word could get out a lot quicker if it's a mass media. And you'd be amazed at how little bit of money, for example, $50 will keep a girl in school for six months. So you know, something we spend on lunch sometimes would help them. Yes. So I'm thinking about if they need scholarships to get educated to reach for the Greens. That's one thing. Another though is what we do at Stanford, business plan competition. Somebody wants to start a business and they want to get funded and they think it's viable. We have the short question is, is anybody giving the girl child network an opportunity to learn how to start businesses and then to get the businesses financed, either micro lending or micro equity or whatever else so that they could start doing whatever they want to do. Yeah, the short answer to that is no. What was it that you had asked? Could you repeat that talk? The short question is, what about an idea like either a business plan competition or something if they want a business being up at the only thing but whatever they want to do to create value, give them help not a handout but financing so that they can create the value. Yeah, the question was really about creating a business plan or helping them develop financing. I mean, it's all about the sustainable issues. And the short answer is no and I think it's something that we would love to take on at some point. Yes. I have a question asked to which you said earlier that you spoke to these throttle doctors and what did you, what did they say to you when you confronted them about what they've been dealing or what they've been saying? The question was about reference to the tribal doctors and why they were doing this. It's very complicated. I think it's a couple of things. There's a, besides the myth that if you rape a virgin, you'll cure your AIDS. Many people think that it's rural, uneducated men who are doing it and that is not the case. These are college educated family men with children of their own who you would see on the street and think absolutely not. I think traditional healers, there's been a great deal of Western influence so they're losing their power. AIDS is a relatively new epidemic there and so they are feeling powerless and it is a way for whatever reason. Historically in Zimbabwe, women, virgins blood and being a virgin is a very powerful entity. I think there's a little bit of witchcraft in their history as well. So even before the onset of AIDS, men would kidnap young girls and cut their skin and take a vial of blood out and so they would put the vial of blood in their stores and the idea that if you have that vial of blood in your stores that you will be very rich, that people will be drawn to your stores. So there's a little bit of that that has gone on for probably from the beginning of time and I think that evolved with the traditional healers. I think there's a lot of power issues going on and there's a great deal of poverty and desperation. I mean it's number one AIDS capital and when a witch doctor or a traditional healer says to you if you rape a virgin it will cure your AIDS. I mean just I'm not excusing it but on some level here's someone who's desperate who probably has their own family and how do I find a way to survive this? So it's very complicated and we do explore that in the documentary. Last question. Yes. So are you guys hoping for some form of political changes well where in some way the international community sort of affecting the political situation in Zimbabwe and you and sort of trying to affect that and cause that to change things with this situation? But are you primarily focusing more on just bottom up change focusing on the girls and the network? His question was whether we were looking at creating political change to affect the situation or sort of a groundswell bottoms-up approach to the girls learning and developing. I don't believe that situation in Zimbabwe will change very soon. One of two things will happen is someone will kill President Mugabi or he will remain in power until he dies and I believe his mother lived till over a hundred. So it's not something the people of Zimbabwe are looking forward to. Even the UN this morning had said they don't want to get involved. I think when we talk about human rights issues that part of why Zimbabwe you don't hear about it like Darfur or the Congo is because Mugabi has put a lock on the press and you can't hear. And if you talk to people in some of the other southern countries most will say that Zimbabwe is probably the worst country in southern Africa right now. So there have been people who've listened. I spent some time in Washington DC. I spoke at the UN. I spoke at Amnesty. The problem is anyone who's been concerned they're on the political circuit and it's kind of hard to tell whether they really are concerned about the issue or it's something for a political game. So I wish I had an answer to that. I... Yeah. Did what? Did the DC trip come from a movie for such a waste of time? No it didn't. All right so we'd love to at this point show the trailer. Can we do that? Thank you. Thank you.
