 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Today we have a very special guest. It is my pleasure to welcome Britt Moran. She's an entrepreneur and author and the founder and CEO of Britton Co., which is an online platform for do-it-yourself project aimed at women and girls. Britt worked at both Apple and Google. And in 2011 when she was only 25 years old she left Google to start Britton Co., which is more than 10 million monthly users. Please join me in welcoming Britt. Thank you. Thanks for having me here. I am originally from Texas. I went to UT. So I didn't think that the first time I would be in front of a classroom would be outside of my home state. But it's great to be here. Raise your hand if you've heard of Britton Co., or know of Britton Co. before. Okay, awesome. Good. Before you even did that intro. I'm going to have a pretty candid discussion with you guys today. I'm going to tell you about kind of my path to becoming an entrepreneur, the hard times, the happy times. It's been four years now as of Monday that I started Britton Co., I did it all by myself in the very beginning, literally alone in my apartment in San Francisco. Now we have a team of over 80 people, have raised over 30 million in funding. So I'll tell you all about that. I'm also going to talk a lot about creativity and why I think it's important, not just for us as human beings, but for society at large and how it ties into the maker movement, which is something I'm very passionate about as well. But before we get started, I wanted to paint the mission of Britton Co., especially for those of you who might not have known about Britton Co. before today. And this started as an experiment that we did. I had the hypothesis when I was starting this company that adults and especially adult women don't think they are very creative. My girlfriends all the time and even myself occasionally would just say literally things like, oh, I wish I were creative, I wish I were an artist. And I kept asking, why would you say that? When you were three, four or five years old, I'm sure that if people put blocks or legoes or play-doh or crayons in front of you, you went to town and you just dove right in. So what happened between the five year olds and the 25 year olds? So I got a group of the five year olds and put them into a room and asked them to do a lot of creative things. And then I got the 25-ish year olds and put them into a room and asked them to do the same things. We caught it all on video and here's what happened. And I see two, take one. This is a really fun one. Okay. I want you to pick any of those caves that you like and I want you to think about and become a character and I want you to act out that character. Okay. Ready, set, go. Hi Elizabeth, ready to go play? Want a jump rope now? We use our graduation a lot. Okay, you can paint whatever you want. I painted me and my dog playing. It's almost more intense and those are little pieces of day and that's the grass, that's the dirt and under it is just all color. And then just a bunch of flashes and dots. I'm not an artist. I love painting. I consider going to art school when I was a lot younger. My life took a different path and I rarely paint. My former dream job as a kid, I loved drawing and I loved doodling and animation. What would you do in your life to be a creative? I would just make time for it. You know, I'm a busy life enough to time so that's something we can fall by the way side. How do it feel to some general be creative today? It was very hard. Now we go play some of our loves cooking. Now it's done. Now we put it back on to be able to cool off and then it dance more. That was awesome. It was really, really fun. Did anything scare you? No, no, no, not at all. It was awesome. It was the best day of my life. So that went the way I thought it would thank God because we invested a lot into making that video. But that fundamentally is our mission at Britain Co. And I saw the same pattern in my own life. This was me as a little girl. It was a girl scout. I loved making things, loved creating things. Took art classes as a kid. This was my third grade master piece. Was constantly doodling and drawing into my early teenage years. And then I got a cell phone and I became obsessed with technology. And I started taking computer science classes. And I really just cared about getting straight to Silicon Valley. I actually graduated college at UT, early, almost two years early, and came straight out here all through college. I was interning with Silicon Valley companies. I ended up taking a job at Apple. I was working in iTunes. This was iTunes pre-anything but music. So that was a really fun job. I was going to concerts a lot. I was meeting with record labels a lot. Starting to learn a little bit more about the entertainment industry. And then I went to Google for about four years. I started on the map's team and then moved to search products, Work for Marissa Meyer, who's now become a great mentor of mine. I was working in product management and product marketing. And ultimately they asked me if I would go over to the YouTube division and head up a new product, we were going to be launching called Google TV. Google TV was an Android-based platform that really brought everything you love about the internet and internet video to your television. And it was my job not only to launch this product. I was given literally tens of millions of dollars as a 24-year-old to go do that. But I also had to convince content networks, cable operators, all kinds of content providers to digitize their content and put it on the internet. This is back in 2009. And back then that was such a foreign topic for them. They, you know, I would meet with people like ABC and the New York Times and CNN and they asked like, what Google just wants to take over the world? Like you just want our content. Like we're not going to do this. Like we didn't know how to digitize our content. No one's ever going to watch internet video. They're only going to watch television. And I was kind of like shocked because I was like, are you joking? Like that's all people want to watch. Especially if you can turn on your TV and your living room and have the option to watch a New York Times video or an ABC family like Moody Marathon. Like who cares? It's video is video. So what I saw when I was doing that was that these traditional media companies were pretty behind in their thinking. And even if they were forward thinking about digitizing their content, they were large businesses that were moving very slowly. But they did have, however, was a lot of eyeballs. These people actually wouldn't even want to talk to Google sometimes because they didn't care. They already had mass distribution. They did have a lot of advertising dollars as well. And most of them cared mostly about the brands of their shows and their characters and their cast members. And when I thought about what I was doing, even working in YouTube, it was the same thing. It was people connecting with people. In Silicon Valley, that's a foreign concept because you build an app and just try to make it viral. You don't really think about the brand or really connecting with a community of people behind the screen. But in the media world, that's all anyone cares about. It's having that emotional experience and creating really high quality content. Anyways, fast forward. I left Google when I was 25 because I felt like after having a few years under my belt at Apple and Google, I was ready to try something new and to take a risk and to start a company of my own. I knew I wanted to do it in the tech space. I was where I was based. I had a lot of connections at that point. And being 25, there's not a lot to lose. I was not yet married. I had made enough money at Apple and Google to save up a little bit of money to get started. And I did not worry about funding a family or kids or so forth. But first, it took a few months off. I decided I needed to just chill out a little bit. I'd worked really hard. I graduated college early. My friends thought I was crazy for doing that. And what I missed the most was actually doing things with my hands. It had been years since I had actually made stuff. Just so happened, the same month I left Google, this place called Techshop, opened in San Francisco. Who knows what Techshop is? Oh, not that many people. So it's basically like a gym for making things. You pay about 99 bucks a month. You can come in anytime and use all of these really cool machines ranging from 3D printers and laser cutters to digital sewing machines and screen printers and vinyl cutters. And you really just get to go to town. I had such a fun time at Techshop. I ended up being there literally every day. And I had no idea how to use these machines when I started. But after understanding that really what I was doing was creating designs and Photoshop or Illustrator, pressing a button and exporting it onto a laser cutter or a 3D printer to create a physical product, my mind was blown. And I just wanted to do it over and over again. Everyone around me at Techshop were mostly men. They were kind of working in silos. It didn't feel communal. Yet at the same time, that same year, Pinterest had launched. And on Pinterest, it was all millennial women and DIY was the top category. All they wanted to pen were things about crafts and cooking recipes and all kinds of things to make. And that seemed kind of crazy to me because while I was at Techshop and I was doing all this stuff, my girlfriends would come up to me like I told you before and say like, oh, you're so creative. I wish I were creative like you. And I was like, I didn't know how to do this stuff a few months ago. It really wasn't that hard. I just like learned it. There are like online galleries and resources. These machines actually did the making. Like I didn't really do it. And meanwhile, they were pinning all the things they wanted to make. So it seemed like there is this delta and this gap between them aspiring to be creative but not actually knowing how to be creative. So Brunei Brown says this, I'm not very creative, doesn't work. There is no such thing as creative people, non-creative people. They're only people who use their creativity in those who don't. And I fully agree with this statement. And that again is the point of my business. And that's when the light bulb did go off. And I was like, is this a business? How could I make this a business? Clearly I'm really passionate about it. I could see myself doing this for a long time. It matters in the world. It's a problem I see. So I started looking at the industry. And of course, I thought of Martha Stewart. And I was like, she was the leader of creativity for like my mom and my mom's mom. But she's, it doesn't really resonate with today's consumer. Like the stuff Martha would make would be like beautiful cakes and table settings that might take you the whole day. But it would be really amazing and your friends would be so jealous. And it felt really aspirational but not really relatable. Today's society has maybe 30 minutes has never done it before. Like it's totally freaked out about doing it in the first place. So what are like the hacks to get them there faster? I also thought about the, you know, retail world of crafting and arts and crafts. Michaels is the leader of that space. They do $5 billion of revenue a year. Followed closely by Joanne's and Hobby Lobby who each do multi-billions of dollars of revenue as well. The whole craft industry at large in the US alone is a $34 billion industry, which has not been disrupted in a very long time. Then I started of course going to data. So I looked up terms on Google search trends. How to had been growing over the years. 3D printing of course was a new technology that was starting to grow as a search term. And the maker movement which I found the most interesting was a term that didn't even exist before about 2007 or 2008. So the maker movement is about this new cultural shift and how people, especially young people, want to be making and creating and how these new types of machines and internet resources are helping them do that. So why is all of this happening now? Why are the young people really interested in this? I have some hypotheses. I think a lot of it is cultural. So we're seeing each other do it a lot. We're seeing trends of our tisinal. We're back lashing against packaged food brands. We don't want to buy frozen dinners anymore. Like I know my parents bought me in the 80s and early 90s. We want to shop small and support our local communities. We also have a research report that says I could actually buy the right resources. I could make products that are better than the ones I buy in stores. And this is from about 20 to 50 year olds consumers who said that. I also just think like we're tired of screens sometimes. Sometimes we want to disconnect and we haven't been able to do that. This is the first generation that's really grown up without being forced to take home economics or shop class who's had two working parents while they were growing up as children. And really just never learned to do this stuff before. Finally, it's just our human nature. Look back at our ancestors. They literally had to create to survive. They had to build things. They had to cook for themselves. It was a part of society. Now of course we can outsource all these things if we want to. We can postmates our dinner over if we want to. We can have people do all the building and making for us. But inside we are literally made to be creators. So I decided to do this as a business. I really didn't know exactly how I was going to do it. But I knew I had to just start. And I went back to my Google roots, especially for the Google TV roots. I thought if I'm going to attract a large audience, I don't want to have to pay for that audience. So I'm going to create a lot of really amazing content that's going to get them to come to the site. Then I can market whatever it is I end up wanting to market to them for free. And hopefully I can actually teach them some things as well. So I literally did this all on my own. I spent a few months just making content. I was the photographer, the editor, the writer, the CEO, the accountant, everything. I did have an outsource design agency. I think I paid $5,000 to make our kind of now looks ghetto website. I did all my press alone. I actually scored an LA Times article on the Day of Launch, which was like huge in my opinion. I tried to pretend like I was a 10 person company when I was a 1 person company. And I just kept deciding to keep going. It was really hard at first. I actually said this in the launch blog post I wrote, which is creating things, businesses, products, software, and crafts. It's my life's destiny. It's my true passion. And I couldn't be more excited about putting my knowledge and skills to use to help others live a more creative and efficient life at home. It's nice to look back at that. I actually found that on Monday, which was our 4 year anniversary, like I told you. And to see that your mission hasn't really changed in 4 years is something a lot of startups can't say. So I feel proud that at least that's still intact. Hiring team is the next step. So again, I was bootstrapping this for the first few months. My first two hires were that guy. He was our first engineer. His name's Paul. And then the girl in the back behind him, that was a cooking off site for our team, was our first kind of writer, content creator, creative director, all rolled up in one. The other girl was a freelancer who helped create content as well. And the goal at first was to continue to create a lot of content, but to build these ancillary apps that we would use to create utilities in people's lives. And we were starting with all the life stages. We wanted you to wedding and home and baby and pets and create ways that people could be creative through software. That's what our team ended up looking like after the first year. We had about 9 people. And we ended up actually raising over a million dollars as our seed round about 6 months in. We raised for mostly Silicon Valley investors. A lot of big names as well as some angels as well in that round. But it was really, again, to launch our first app and to create the content around it that would help drive people to that app. Just to touch on this, being a woman, this is a question I get asked about in Silicon Valley quite a bit, especially every reporter asked me about it all the time. And my response is this. I think it actually can set you apart. Clearly, there are a lot of men in this room, so I'm sorry. But if you are a woman, you're thinking about starting a business. I have had the opportunity to not only create a business for women, mostly by women. We have about three quarters of our staff are women. But it's a women by the most things. They're the biggest consumers on the internet. They consume the most content as well. They're hopefully going to be president one day. And it's a great way to set yourself apart from what everyone else, especially in Silicon Valley is doing. There are far too few women. And I think those who actually are starting as entrepreneurs really can stand out. So the first year, these are some images that's us taking out the trash in the office. It was a scrappy year. Again, we had about nine people by the end of the year. This is in 2012. We would also do photo shoots that were really, I mean, I'm going to use the word again, get out. Like, we would go up to the roof and pretend like we were in some fancy city or something. And they actually ended up looking nice. Like, that was in the SF Chronicle, the far right. But it wasn't that glamorous behind the scenes. We didn't have a professional photographer. Like, we were really faking it till we were making it. So kind of like in summary, again, over a million raised, 19 members, we did actually have a small pivot. So a few months in, like I told you, we were creating these apps and thinking about this whole strategy as content marketing for the apps. The content itself was like becoming really popular. And so we sort of paused halfway through the year and decided, let's actually just focus all of our effort on growing this company as a media business instead of an app business and see what happens. We actually started testing commerce as well. So DIY and creativity are kind of the essence of what we do. We decided to create DIY kits as a subscription business, kind of like Birchbox for DIY. So every month, people would get a different project with all the supplies and components they need to put it together in a kit. We right off the bat had hundreds of subscribers. So it was going pretty well. Started going on television. I put my name in the company, primarily because I wanted people to understand that I was authentic as a person behind this brand that I cared about it, that I was the target consumer and could relate to our demographic that we were reaching. But I called it Britain and Co. and the Co stands for community. And I wanted everyone else to feel like they were part of that community as well. So our community today consists not only of all of our users, but of designers, makers, artists, all kinds of creative people who we highlight around the site and I'll talk more about that later. Anyways, it did help me those secure different types of press opportunities because there was a face to this brand. So the Today Show called up, midway through the first year, it asked me to come on and it was crazy to think that my childhood dream of going on Today Show could come true and it happened and I was so nervous about it and then they kept asking me back. So that was a big highlight of the first year. I think overall though, the first year of a startup is just ups and downs. Every single day, I'm a very number driven person. I would constantly be tracking our analytics and if it was a bad day, I literally like wouldn't have talked to anyone the rest of the day. I didn't want to go out to dinner at night. I would just go home and soak. It was an amazing day. I would have dreams about selling my company and thinking like everything was going to be amazing. So it was just like this all the time. And of course, we were scrappy. I remember fun memories of ordering the toilet paper and thinking like, why didn't we have an office manager yet? Like why am I the CEO doing all this? That's just how it has to be in that first year. So my learnings, data, data, data, we use that data to understand that our content business was by far and away growing faster than the app business and decided to really focus our efforts there. That leads to the second point of keep your mission. Don't be afraid if your execution tactics need to change. And if you think you should fire someone, it's already too late. I had to make my first fire that first year. We had an engineer, literally he brought in a six pack one day to work and just kept drinking. And I was like, what is happening? It was a really amazing engineer, but had a really terrible attitude. And in Silicon Valley, amazing engineers, there are many of them, but it's really hard when you're a small startup to attract them. So it was a really hard thing for me to have to let that person go, but it was right for the company. And be a waffle. There's this book called Women Are Spaghetti and Men Are Waffles, which is basically about how our emotions interact with each other. So women have a lot of the point of this from the others perspective. But women have all these emotions and they're loosely framed and men just compartmentalize things and can easily move from one thing to the next. And I learned in that first year that you really have to control your emotions and you have to be able to fire someone one minute and step into an interview with the New York Times the next minute and be extremely positive and happy about everything going on in your life. And that's just the way that business works. The second year, we were starting to outgrow our space. We literally had conference rooms and bathrooms. Again, to this scrappy theme. We did double in size though. So and we raised a series A. So we raised over $6 million continuing to secure really great press about 20 team members. We ended up killing subscriptions. The business I was talking to you about. Not because it wasn't working, but because our customers really wanted to customize all of their products. So in their projects, so they wanted to make jewelry instead of home decor. They wanted a baking project. And operationally it was just not possible. So we decided to sort of put a can on it until we rethought commerce and what that meant for us. Instead, we upleveled our content. We finally hired a professional photographer. We hired more editors. We hired a sales team so we could actually start making money. We launched a New York office. We launched remake, which Tina actually was able to speak up this year. This is our third year doing it. The first year remake is a conference in a festival. The conference is focused on all of the biggest influencers in the maker movement, ranging from neuroscientist to artist to musicians. And the festival is a place for the general public to come and actually just get their hands dirty, learning how to make stuff and shopping from makers and artisans. So that was a really big deal for us. We did secure major partnership deals. I became a spokesperson for companies like Target and even Velcro. And we were beginning to really get into the press cycle more and more, continue to television and things like that as well. So this is really a good growth year for us. Biggest learnings, higher a sales team as soon as possible. I was probably about a year too late on this. Learning that I could do a million dollars in revenue in a year was shocking to me. And it was really just took a small team of sales people to go make that happen. Shake them haters off. So especially when you are the face and the name of a brand, you're going to get haters. And you're going to get people critiquing you all the time. That was probably one of the hardest lessons I had to learn in 2013, the second year. It's difficult. It's difficult. Celebrities talk about this all the time, I guess. But it's like everyone has an opinion about you and the work you're doing and why you're doing it and what your motives are. Now my response to this is that if you believe you are truly a good person who is really kind to people and you have a good mission, you just want to help people do more of what they want to be doing, I don't know if anyone can actually bring you down. So that's been my response to all the haters. And then content quality is king. So as soon as we leveled, we upleveled our content. I mean, traffic just exploded. We had amazing photography, amazing journalism and writing and we really saw that payback for us. The third year, our team, we didn't actually have to fundraise, which was a big deal. If you don't have to fundraise, you shouldn't. We doubled again to about 40 people. This is last year, 2014. And I would say this is the year we really, truly found product market fit. We were tripling, if not quadrupling, in growth year over year, both from a revenue perspective and a user perspective. We did re-enter commerce again and we started by really testing. We did two weeks sprint, which we would put a new product out there, meaning a software product and then a different variation of commerce. And in two weeks, there may be a month max. We would understand if it was successful. So we had parameters set up to understand and gauge what do people want to buy from us? What do they not want to buy from us? And let's do more of that and less of the things that they don't want to do. We ended up finding that people really wanted to come to us to learn. They wanted to take classes about how to do this stuff because they didn't know how. So we started launching classes ranging from calligraphy to coding to cake decorating to digital photography. We started giving them the kits of all the supplies we needed to take those classes. So if you want to take calligraphy, you can get the inks and the pens and the papers and everything you need. And we found that they also wanted to support artisans and makers. But they sort of felt like going to a place like Etsy was a little overwhelming. There was so much supply of product that no one was really curing it down. We were really great at especially being a media company was curation and editorializing things and products. So we launched a marketplace, a curated marketplace of different types of makers and their products. I was pregnant last year. That's me on stage at Remake again last year. Literally 37 weeks pregnant. That was really crazy. I literally could have been in labor if I hopefully, I didn't. I was actually a week late to another store. But it was nuts. I had a lot of women entrepreneurs that I knew, but not many that had been kind of in the thick of their growing their business while they were having their first child. And it's hard. You think like what are my employees going to think? What are my investors going to think? We do have to raise another round of financing soon. What do we do about that? Can I walk into a new venture capitalist office? I think 37 weeks pregnant and go raise money. And so it was difficult and made it through, but decided to fundraise in January instead of in Q4 last year, which meant that I basically had a month or two after having a baby to pull myself together and go pitch investors. Meanwhile I was writing a book, our first book. I was hiring our first adults. So people over 40 is what I call a fire as adults, which really can shake up the culture of a startup when you're like all people in their 20s and early 30s. We also were testing retail businesses. So we launched a pop-up store in San Francisco, which was all based on experiential retail. So people could come in, they could take classes, they can sit down and do free projects, they could also buy goods from our makers. It was a combination of traditional retail and experiential retail. And we also tested wholesale. So we are making all these kits and products and we wanted to test if they would sell and other stores. So we put them into different types of retail stores all around the country. So it was a big year. Learnings from that year, product market fit is crucial. This is something that you should, if you're an entrepreneur, strive to get to as soon as possible. You can get to what your investors will continue to invest money in. And if you aren't there, they will not. Company cultural changes should be expected as you scale. We had a lot of pushback from our 25-year-old engineers who were like, why are we hiring an adult? It's a suit. We had to explain why it would be good for the business and why the culture wouldn't get super processed heavy. Fancy bias is a real thing. Like I did have to rethink our fundraising schedule because our board didn't want me walking into a venture capitalist office like eight months pregnant. It's comparable. We got through it, but it's not the greatest thing. And it does detract from, with your female entrepreneur, who's young, who wants to have a family. The fourth year, we continued to grow. So this is this year, I'm going to get to catch you up. We raised $20 million. So after going through that labor and delivery process, I went right out into the streets and started pitching and got a lot of really great interest. Proud and some amazing investors raised $20 million, which has now enabled us to hire 80 people. The book launched a couple of months later and made the best seller list. That was a big highlight of this year, too. At remake this year, we had over 10,000 attendees come out, which was huge. So we've been doubling attendance at that event every year. We now have tens of millions of people every month coming to our sites and all of our different platforms that we're on. We have made a deeper investment in commerce and online education. We now have close to 50 classes online. We have thousands of products in our marketplace. We have a TV and major press. Got invited to the White House to interview our CTO, Megan Smith. The White House has also invested in a department of making, which is a new initiative to get more people into making and they truly believe in the maker movement and what it can do for STEM education in America. We actually just a couple weeks ago put our first real product into all target stores, which is actually a coloring book for adults. I'll get to that in a second. We launched a foundation, which for a startup and it's third or fourth year is kind of unheard of, but it's called the I Am Creative Foundation. Even though we're giving grants up to $15,000 to women and girls for their big creative pursuits. Of course, that's not millions of dollars, but it is something and it's pretty meaningful. We've been able to now fund five different women, one 13-year-old as part of that, to go out and open photo studios to teach after-school programs to girls and teach them how to create fashion tech hardware and then go sell that at different maker fairs around the country. We've been able to make differences in people's lives, which is a startup is really meaningful. And then we launched a video. So up till now, we've been doing a lot of editorial content, a lot of written content and we really wanted to focus on video kind of going back to my Google TV roots again. And we'll show you just a couple quick videos that we have so you can understand what that means. So this first one is really just basic. It's a how-to series that we created. So again, just kind of trying to bring to life some of these projects and ideas and teaching people that they're pretty easy and you can learn all of that in under 60 seconds in a video. We've also done more documentary style videos and really starting to think about, you know, back to the Google TV days, how do we start creating digital video content that can maybe one day go to television instead of vice versa creating television content that become digital? I'll just play like a few seconds of this next video so you see the dramatic difference of the type of video quality that we're producing. I know real recipe of how I work my opinions and outrage slowly grow in me based on my everyday experience and things that I see. The way to media portrays women and sexuality not bothers me a lot. It's important of how you look in a certain way of being feminine. That is something that was very deep in your self-esteem. I think that has been the tool to keep us down. So it goes on for a few minutes but the point is that we're doing a variety of different types of creative directions with video. By the way, that woman, she was working at agency hated all the way that the media was stereotyping women in advertising and decided to start vandalizing their content and putting up pictures on top of it. It's a different story about creativity and about art that we really wanted to tell. It's a little deeper and a little bit darker. Anyways, our brand is expanding though to think about all the different ways we can tell stories about art and creativity that aren't just practical how to projects. We really are trying to be really mass in understanding the world of creativity. My last year, what have I learned? Mom's are superheroes. It's true. I feel like a real superhero. There's literally a point in my day when I was out there pitching, doing press interviews for the book launch. I was pumping in the back of a car like an Uber and the guy was like, what's happening in the back seat? And it was totally nuts. So I've had to completely change my life in my schedule and randomly like this has been our best and most successful year yet. So I don't know, maybe there's an alignment there. Don't be afraid to hire expensive people. They do the job of two or more people. So this is the first year. I really like up leveled our executive team. I hired a CFO which I wish I would have hired three years ago because I hate everything related to the CFO job function. Like I just hate spreadsheets. And having her here has given me so much more free time to go and do the things I love to do and to focus my time on building the vision of the business, the product, an engineering organization, the content organization, the video organization. So anyways, that's the second one. And the last is two most important company traits have been communication and focus. So there's a period when you're under growth between 50 and 150 employees. This is a pattern that happens to all startups where you go from this team that everyone knows each other and everyone kind of hangs out together to there being clicks that form, to hiring your first real HR person, your first lawyer. There's more processes and everyone starts getting upset and clicky and like passive aggressive. The thing that you have to do the most is over communicate why you're doing the things you're doing, why you're making the changes you're making, that you know, reinforce how important everyone is on your team and reinforce the focus of the business. You can't be doing a million things. You have to really focus on the things that are working and do more of those. So what's next? Well, for Britain Co, we're going to continue to really scale as media business. We're going to keep doing more video, more editorial. The media has like really beautifully aligned into this online education platform which is another version and an adaptation of video in my opinion. And then continuing to create products and to help other makers sell their products. And that's kind of what we're up to. But more importantly, I'm interested in what's happening in mass culture. And there are two trends that I'm really seeing. The first is mainstream creativity. Literally as I was driving down here today, New York Times reporter called me wanting to interview me because she's under the pretense that creativity is the next meditation. And that's exactly what I've been starting to think about this year. We've had that's under the pre-sane preintense of why we met. I'm fascinated with the neuroscience behind creativity and how it really can impact your brain. This is me at Burning Man this year is the first time I have her when it was a crazy experience. I was there for two days and I thought it was like this crazy rave in the desert. But what I found was that it was this beautiful place where people were making art. And they weren't afraid to express themselves. This woman is dressed up all in tutus. Literally that's all she's wearing. Which is really crazy. Celebrities even are starting to go to this festival. And they're experimenting with their own creativity and the way that they dress and the way they act. I look at my son who's now won. His name is Ansel. And he wants nothing more than just to do creative stuff all day long. And again, like I keep coming back to this. Like why is this good for humans, adults and kids alike. We tend to find that there's a lot of data about how creativity can be good for your well-being. So it can reduce cognitive impairment as you're aging. We also find that anxiety disorders which are the most common mental illness in the US is the most common. Help is helped by creativity. Coloring books and back to kind of my point there are one of the things that are helping people with anxiety and depression relax and de-stress. Four of the top ten Amazon products from this year are adult coloring books. All of Amazon products. Four of the top ten. 30 million globally are affected by depression. So imagine the impact that we can make if more people are participating in creative projects that can help them release stress, anxiety and tension. More about the brain. We're really working to understand what's happening with the brain. There are actually people here at Stanford who are working with here, completing research studies that have lasted for five years. And our understanding how the brain is impacted by creativity. And if it's a muscle that can actually be trained, similar to muscles in your body and how they're trained when you're exercising, sneak peak, yes, it does get stronger as you practice more. This was an example of the coloring book we launched just to start proving this stuff to the mainstream culture. We did it in partnership with Krayola. And we're continuing to scale our online classes. Like I said, I really think part of the reason why people aren't participating in creative projects is because they don't know how to start. They literally don't have the skills that they needed that other past generations had. The maker movement though is what's more exciting to me. And this is something that will continue to get bigger and bigger every year like you saw in that Google search graph. It's about everything from kind of the analog world of making and creativity. All arts like letterpress, which are coming back. But also, all the benefits that technology is bringing to how we're making and creating. We're able to open source our designs so that others can freely download them and access them. There are online learning platforms, not just from Briton Co, but from others as well, where people are able to get educated if they don't live near a college university or any type of workshop that offers classes. Pretty rendering is so cool right now. This is a new startup called ModZee that launched. You can literally take a picture of any room in your house and they'll 3D render it and show you what real furniture looks like in that room. They're importing products from West Elm in Creighton, Barrel and letting you swap things in and out. So from an interior designer's perspective, this is a new way to think about creativity. Smart devices of course and machines that are helping us learn things faster. This is a favorite example of mine. It's called the G-TAR. It's an iPhone-connected guitar. It literally shows you the chords from an app on your phone that you should be playing. So it teaches you how to play the guitar just from looking at your phone. Crowdfunding of course is what's enabling all of these small entrepreneurs and startups to actually get started. We've seen some amazing new products launched because of Kickstarter and Indiegogo. There's only more of that to come. 3D printers which has not yet gone mainstream for sure. They're still very expensive. Quality isn't there yet. But they are getting way better. People are using them to create human tissue and bone to create all kinds of food. I'm an advisor for a company that's actually using 3D printers to create real clothing and textiles through a process called electronic spinning. And in the future, imagine going into your closet, downloading a blouse design from J. Crew, pressing prints and having it export for you in a glass machine. This is a real future that's literally years in front of us. So what does this mean? This is all just a few years out. We're in this moment before when inkjet printers were only able to be found at Kinkos. We're in that moment with 3D printers right now and a lot of the maker movement. But soon we're all going to have access to these devices. They're going to be just a couple hundred bucks. We're going to have them on our desktops and our kitchens. They're going to be the way that we produce and manufacture on our own. And so what implications could that have? It's something I'm thinking a lot about. Maker spaces right now are the FedEx and Kinkos of the world. It's where people are going to use these machines and devices. I think these will continue to be popular for the next two years until we see those price points fall. The cost of prototyping because of these makers' bases has gone down significantly. It used to have to prototype things in China for like tens of thousands of dollars. This is the Dodo case. It's an iPad case you guys might have seen it before. Literally it was made in just a couple of weeks for about a thousand dollars. Apple saw it, decided to pick it up in their online store. It's all like a million dollars of product within its first month. So I'll offer just a thousand bucks and a guy who's tinkering with a laser cutter. I'm really excited about customization. Think about the idea that if we have this long tail manufacturing or you're able to make stuff on your own, you can add your name to things. You can add colors that you like. You can scan your body and make things perfectly fit you the way you want it to. Customization is going to be a really big option for us in the future. But it does open us up to copyright issues. I think of this a lot like the music industry for all able to download and open source files. What does that mean? Does the designer who made the J crew blouse get credit when you download it? Does he get paid? Can I illegally send that file to someone else? It's going to get really interesting with the way that digital files are transferred for product designs. The whole nation like I mentioned, the White House is behind us. It's incredibly excited about steam, science, technology, engineering, art and math. I say steam because art is included in that and the White House is starting to use that term as well. We're seeing kids, especially those and their early pre-teen years, really embrace this. I mentor a group of 12-year-olds who actually know more about CAD design than me and it kind of freaks me out and they also speak Mandarin. The future generations are definitely on this. But of course it all comes back to play. Regardless of how this affects our economy or different industries, I hope that people will also just take time to participate in creativity in their daily life. One exciting note to end on is that with all of these changes, the maker movement, people are predicting that self-manufacturing in homes could equate to a $55 billion industry by the year 2020. That's just five years away. This is on top of arts and crafts industry that already exist. So this industry is only getting bigger and it's getting bigger very quickly. So pay attention. That's the end of my talk. I have a few minutes for questions but I hope everyone in here will also just take away not only my story and what I think is exciting about the future but the fact that all of you, I don't care how old you are, were that kid one time and played with Legos, blocks, paint, told stories and you're still that person today. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You have questions? Eight minutes if anyone has a question. Yep. Yeah. What would you change for highly processed, you know, how do you say, like, I wish I had some people earlier in my life, how, you know, was it changing, you think about, you don't have a problem? So, yes, what would we change about the way we hired and the order that we hired? I think coming out of the tech industry, I was very serious about hiring engineers at first, which is always a good thing to do, you know, every company today is a technology company and needs engineers. But I think a salesperson from the start would have been a really smart hire. The sooner you can start creating and generating revenue in your company, the more freedom and autonomy you have about whether or not you want to raise more money, whether you have to and how investors are valuing your company. And on that note, if you're going to be generating revenue, hiring a CFO who can really manage those budgets and maximize kind of your profits and losses is a really great thing to hire early on as well. Yep. In the back. Well, as some people say, you know, with Wagesreaser, it comes more responsibilities to more people. I'm wondering how you balance all of this stuff, you know, the needs of the venture capital needs of the people in the company, the philanthropy and of course stuff that's healthy for yourself. That's a good question. Yes. How do I balance everything? So, when investors, we have a foundation, I have a real life sort of. The answer is that it's an ongoing challenge. I especially know that I have a family. I'm constantly torn between, you know, whether to hang out with friends or to go home and spend time with my son or to go to an important business center that may or may not lead to a major partnership or a future round of financing. And I have to make these trade-offs all the time. And it sucks because you think about like in five years, if my company completely crashes and dies, am I just wasting, if I'm wasting my time by not spending it with my kids or my friends and going to that business center. But it puts the pressure on you to make sure it's going to work. And for me, this isn't, you know, a company that I started just to try to make a lot of money. It's a company I started because I'm genuinely passionate about it and I genuinely believe there's a problem in the world and a big opportunity coming as a way to fix it. And I wanted to be part of that. So I'm just excited because my life and my work are almost one in the same. That makes it easier to create that balance. Yep, right here. Can you tell me more about how to do fine growth market fit? Sure, he wants to know how we found product market fit. So it goes back to data. And for us, you know, primarily being a media company at the start, we were creating tons of different types of content. And I wasn't even sure what type of user would want to ingest that content. And I had a hunch it would be women similar in age to me in their 20s and 30s. But you know, I didn't know if they wanted beauty content or knitting or cooking or technology content. And so as we created more and more of it, we every day were looking at the numbers and understanding what to do more and what to do less of. And it's become a really iterative process. These days too, as a media company, you're putting your content on all these social platforms. And every social platform responds differently. So that's been a big kind of awakening over the last year. We have over 40 million users a month on Pinterest alone. And that audience loves cooking, crafting, kind of beauty content. We do a ton of that type of content just for that audience. The Facebook audience, we have over 20 million monthly users on the FaceR Facebook channel. They love like trendy pop culture content, how to get someone's purple hair that they like Nicki Minaj just died of her purple, how to do yours like that too. So it's a little bit more celebrity infused, a little bit more pop culture. And we've learned through understanding analytics of all these platforms, including our own, how to program content for different channels and different audiences. Yeah. I think it's really interesting watching Blake Lively's preserve brand that had just such a short longevity. And I think that there's a big trend in capitalizing upon this DIY movement. And so I'm just wondering what really do you think distinguishes Britain's success in comparison to other startups like preserve that have failed in this space? Sure. So yeah, Blake Lively launched the site. It was kind of an artisanal marketplace. Sort of similar to part of our commerce business. Her price points were really high. And that's the trade off with this industry is that people that are making things by hand, they're spending literally a month making an intricate, embroidered leather bag. Like they're going to charge $1,000 for that bag because they need to generate revenue for them to live. Yet most consumers that live in the fast fashion world want to only pay 50 or 100 bucks for that bag. So it's hard because I think their price points were a little bit higher. And also again, like I think it comes back to how do you get that audience to engage with you on a daily basis? For us, instead of having to pay to acquire them through Google AdWords or social channels, we create content. We keep them coming back and give them fresh new things to look at. And regardless of whether they're buying something, hopefully they're learning something or they're inspired to want to do something. So I don't know that a commerce business in this space that's selling high-priced products is always going to win. It's just a hard market with high price points. So different consumer. Yep. You talked about how in your first year that you learned how to be a waffle. And so compact to call for that. Part metalized. You're feeling as a women entrepreneur. So as you're growing and you're in your fourth year, is that becoming harder or easier? So she asked me like, OK, I was a waffle. I learned that my first year is becoming harder or easier. Definitely easier. I've gotten, I think, even better at it. My husband calls me a rock. I'm just hard to break. It's anything can happen to me good or bad. And I just try to stay solid and level about it because I know in startup world everything's temporary. You raise a $20 million dollar round of financing and everyone's giving you high fives and press their writing about you all the time. And in the back of your mind as an entrepreneur, you're thinking, will we raise again? Is this going to let everything you're thinking about the end of the world? Yeah, you just secured runway for like two years. So your thoughts are always going to go back and forth. And you just have to find that middle ground. I've gotten a lot better just through experience and practice. Yep. How are you planning to globalize your company? How are you planning globalize? Yeah, I should have. What is the hands and what's next slide where we're a map? So we are definitely thinking about that, probably preparing for it in 2016 and actually starting to globalize in 2017. Maker industry is happening worldwide. The maker movement, the DIY kind of culture. It's not just in the US. So we're really excited to bring it to other countries. I sure you'll agree. This was totally inspiring. Hopefully all of you will go out and do something creative today. Thank you so much. Thank you guys. It's great.
