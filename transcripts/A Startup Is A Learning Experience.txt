 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. So tonight I'm incredibly pleased to introduce Jessica Ma, and she's currently the founder and CEO of Indenero. And I thought we'd maybe just start this conversation with kind of tell me about your company. Short, you get 30 seconds to kind of give us this short version of what do you do and why do we care? My name is Jessica Ma. I run a company called Indenero and we started it about 18 months ago. I went to UC Berkeley and studied computer science. And Molo is there. My best friend Annie and I were working on a past business and you thought it's really difficult to manage our business finances. You never knew how much money we were making, what our margins were, how much we were spending. And I thought there has to be a better way than to use a complex accounting software like QuickBooks. So you started Indenero out of our dorm room and you're Y-comulator funded and then you raise a little money after that and we're still going strong. Great. So let's go back to your days in college. Did you know you wanted to be an entrepreneur? I was pretty sure I wanted to be an entrepreneur. And why was that? I started just building companies in college like very small, just for fun, businesses. And I thought it'd be really cool to do this after college. I wouldn't have to work for anyone. Little did I know how wrong that was. So you already had the bug? Did you have the bug before college? I had the bug in elementary school. Did you have the Lemonade stand? I actually traced drawings. So they looked really professional and I saw them for $10, $20, $50. And so are there originals we could get now on eBay? Oh, God. So you sold traced drawings for how much? In elementary school, I would take my portfolio of three drawings and bring them to the playground and try to sell them to my classmates. Should we ask where they were getting the money from or not? And so any other businesses when you were young? In middle school, I helped design and program websites for other people. And just small stuff like that. And were your parents encouraging you or were they confused? They were very encouraging. My mom still runs her own business and my dad's an engineer. So I got the engineer and entrepreneur side of my family. So by the time you got to college, you were kind of an experienced entrepreneur. Not quite. I thought I was. That's the problem. And. So when you started this idea in college, did you know you wanted it to be a company or did you know it was just a good idea that you were solving a problem for yourself and your friends? It was a great problem to solve. And I didn't know if Indie Nara would turn into a real business. But at the worst case, it would be a fun project to build. We used it to help manage our own money for the future. And if you could sell it to other businesses, that would be even better. So you were an undergrad in computer science. And so you have this idea. What did you do next? I mean, did you code it and then went out and put up a sign that said need money or what did you do? What did you do? Well. Was there an entrepreneurship club or how did you go from, you know, I'm coding away and to like, I think I want to start a company and raise money? We actually started building it to learn how to program and Ruby on Rails. Like, you'd study computer science through our classes. But we didn't know how to do web development that well. And we didn't know how to make something that we could sell to other people. So we thought, let's just build it. Let's program it for fun. So are you saying you didn't learn anything practical in the school up north? Is that? Well, we learned like computer science, fundamentals, but you didn't really know how to build a product and sell it to people and iterate on it quickly. And so then what did you do? You built it and? Yeah, we built it. We started signing people up and one thing we did early on, which I still think was really smart to do, was set up the sign up page such that it would take in a credit card number. We would say we're charging $20 or $30 and see if people would enter in their credit card number. And we did this without even showing screenshots without having a fully built product. And we just wanted to see if people would put in their credit card number and we'd never charged them. But people put in their number and that's when we thought, wow, we could build a real business out of this. And how many people signed up to KVU confidence? Over 50 or? Over 100. Really? Yeah. Wow. Okay, everybody. Well, the first secret set up that webpage. And then what did you do? After that, we decided instead of getting internships that summer, why don't we build this full time for the entire summer? So you started looking for money to fund our living situation. And had you graduated? Not yet. Okay. So this was actually the end of my junior year at Berkeley. And we found out about this cool VC program. Lightspeed Venture Partners offers a grant to students studying engineering up to $36,000. And we applied for it with our idea of IndieNarro and we got the money and we decided to go forward with that. And so what did you have to do for this internship program? It was pretty simple. We just had to fill out a few page applications saying what IndieNarro is and why we're passionate about it. And why we're qualified to actually build it. And we just waited and we got the money and the money we paid for our rent. It paid for our server costs and that was really great. And so that was your summer. You were starting to code the product even more. Yeah. Under this internship. What happened next? After that, we thought, why don't we drop out of college and do this full time? We're going to edit this part out for the University of Grant. Well, I didn't drop out. I'll say that again. I told my parents I was going to drop out. They were petrified. And ultimately, I got connected with a family friend who was one of the early people at Rackspace. And he told me that he too was considering dropping out when he was starting his company. But he was convinced by another family friend not to do that. And the reason being is, even if IndieNarro is a great idea, which isn't that great, it's going to be there for many years. And there's nothing more invaluable than to finish college. Can you say that last part of your life? I mean, I'm not just saying that because I'm here. Thank you for believing that. I really believed that. And I thought I could just learn a lot in that last year of college, have a lot of fun. And when I finished, I would come back and proceed with my company. So you had the summer internship from White Speed. You went back to Berkeley for your senior year. I went back for college. And then what? And virtually no work got done that last year. We were just really focused on school, having fun, having that genuine college experience. And then we thought, why don't we actually do this full time for our job? And so we applied to White Combinator. We applied to Techstars. And just for everybody else, White Combinator Techstars is one. White Combinator and Techstars are early stage accelerator programs. They give you a little money to work on your company. They give you a lot of connections and help in just building a startup. And so you applied what happened? We put in our applications. And it was pretty straightforward. We got in. And- Was there an interview? There was an interview. What was it like? It was really laid back and straightforward. We were really nervous about it. And we put together this list of at least 16 questions on what they might ask us, the asked us none of them. And- What did you think they were going to ask? I thought they'd ask, so why this market, what's your total addressable, like, family for a year and all this, these other questions that I thought real investors would ask. But they just cared about whether or not we spent the time to build a product, whether or not we were passionate about it, and whether or not we were able to get people to put in their credit card number for it. And I think that's what they were most impressed by. And how did they know you were passionate? What did you say? Well, we told them the real story that we built the- We built the business because we had a problem ourselves. And we just wanted to solve that. And like, no person in the right mind goes into the counting business and says, I'm going to build a counting software. Like, that's just insane. So- So people like that. Right. And so what was Y Combinator like? What did you guys do? Y Combinator was a lot of fun. I actually really miss it. Like the day of our graduation, we just took our moving truck and moved on to Mountain View. And every Tuesday night, there was a dinner. So we meet a lot of other entrepreneurs. And it was just like going through college all over again, but over the course of the summer. So what did you do in between the Tuesday night dinners? You would just program a lot. We program, we talk to customers. I would actually leave my living room office to do usability testing with customers. So every Friday, I just line up a bunch of customers back to back and tell them to sign up for in an hour if they hadn't already and just watch them use the product. And that was the smartest thing needed. Okay. So we'll get back to who the customers were. But more about Y Combinator. How long was the program? It was for three months. Great. And then you graduated. Yeah, you graduated. And? And they have a demo day at the end, which means they bring together a lot of investors. And you try to pitch them and you try to raise money. That's assuming that you actually want to raise any money. And that helped us a lot. That helped us find, find their million dollars in funding afterwards. So, whoa, you got a million dollars in funding? It doesn't last that long. Well, wait a minute. You didn't answer for it. You got a million dollars in funding from that Y Combinator demo day? Yeah. Okay. Now, let's get interesting. So tell me about from college to Y Combinator, what was your idea of just up to the Y Combinator demo day? What was your idea of the product and customers? What were those two ideas from your dorm room to the end of demo day? Did it change or was it the same or what did you learn? Yeah, there was a lot of backing forth actually from the day we decided we wanted to solve this problem. We talked to a lot of business owners and asked them what were they using and what do they need solved. And we thought we were going to build a real accounting program. Like we thought we had to learn how to take the CPA exam and just clone QuickBooks and make it easier. But it ended up that no business owner really wanted that. And most business owners weren't using the incumbent in the space. Who was? Who is into its QuickBooks product? So you thought you were building QuickBooks on the web? Yeah, that's what we thought. And but if very few business owners actually use QuickBooks, then how could we do that? So what were they putting their credit card number in for? Well, they wanted a product that would displace their Excel spreadsheet, actually. So most of them were just using Excel for their books? Yeah. Interesting. And so that was your day up to demo day in thinking that that's what you were doing. Yeah, we thought we were building an accounting product and what were we wrong. All right, we'll get to the fun part in a second. But this is a great story. So, wait a minute. How old were you when you got a million dollars? I was 20. Great. I would have been in Brazil with a million dollars. But you instead thought the best use was to work 24-7 for that million dollars. So tell us what happened when you were 20 and you got a million dollars. What did you do next? We sat on it for about a month. We thought, you know, we have a million dollars. Let's not do anything stupid to spend it all away. And of course, we've since spent it all away. And we started hiring people. So how did you know what to do? Well, when we set out to raise the money, we thought we have to hire people with this money. And we got to find a way to grow faster. And did you raise the money from one investor or a bunch or how did it work? We raised it from a bunch of people. And just like all the other decisions we made, we consulted a bunch of people. We got very conflicting advice. And some people said you have to just raise money from one or two BCs and call it the day. And then others said, raise money from a lot of angel investors. You'll get more breath than advice next for tees. And we chose the latter approach. OK. So first question. You chose one in hindsight, right? Decision or wrong? I'm happy with it. OK. Why? Because I was a little bit of a wide breath in expertise. And some angel investors who I thought would be super valuable ended up not being valuable. But others who I wouldn't have let in had I raised a smaller VC round ended up being the most helpful people for the business. Cool. OK. So you got the million dollars. You got some helpful investors. You start hiring people. What were those people supposed to be doing? They were supposed to be programming and building products. OK. And building product for who? Building product for the customer. And a huge issue here was engineers, as I'm sure all of us know, just really like filling elegant code and refactoring a lot and making it really fast. And this was a huge debate and problem within my own company. I always wanted to just build lots of features for the customers. And a few of my engineers just wanted to make a really beautiful good base. And it's just not what customers want. And so what did you find out and how did you find out what customers want? We got out of the building as your book told us to do. And if I was smart, I'd have book here for steps to the epiphany available on Amazon.com. It's a great book. But I won't say that. No. It was one of the only books I read that first summer when we started the company. I read through Eric Rees's blog. He's another great entrepreneur. I read. We started up by Eric Rees' worth buying. And I read through four steps to the epiphany. And that was actually our biggest concern. Because my co-founder and I had this great, yes, background. But we didn't really know how to build useful products that made money. So we decided to set up a very strict schedule for ourselves. Three Friday, we would get out of the building and watch people use the product. And even if there were still more features we wanted to build before we saw people use it, we found out that each customer led to a completely different set of insights that we wouldn't have gotten from past customers. And we couldn't just do it for 10 or 20 or 30 people. We had to survey dozens and dozens and dozens of customers to really figure out what we're going to build. Wow. And so what did you learn? What was the... I mean, this sounds perfect, right? I mean, nothing could go wrong. Well, I mean, we find out that a bunch of the features you built they're not using, you find out that you wasted your time on just thinking about a product roadmap that doesn't make sense. So like one thing you learned early on was not to plan three or six months in advance. Because by doing these customer surveys, we found out that they urgently needed XYZ to be a feature that we just didn't have in our plan. So we had to be really flexible and now we only plan two or three weeks out. So isn't that short-term vision kind of in conflict of having a long-term vision for the company? I don't think they necessarily are. How so? Like, you have a long-term, very high level of broad vision. You want to help every business owner better, manage, and improve their finances. And whether that means going down the path of building accounting software or replacing booking for some accountants or whatever, that's just a high level of vision. But the low level of how to get there is the hard part. And do that cause any conflict with engineering of who wanted to build this perfect code? Yeah, it's really tough because what customers want isn't necessarily what you are your engineering key wants to build. Like some of these features are really, really, really unsexy. Like financial statements and stuff. I think they're awesome. But like, they're not necessarily that exciting. Interesting. So, let me just ask, you're 20 years old, you're a million dollars hiring people, finding them about customers. Sounds awesome. But have you ever hired people before? No, I never hired anyone before. And so, how did you do this? I mean, what kind of people were you looking for and how did you hire them and what did you find out? Well, I haven't always hired that well. Like, when I was in college, I always read about entrepreneurs saying only hire a player. Sure, that's what you did, right? Only hired a player. Well, so I thought, but when you're a first time entrepreneur, you don't really know who an a player is. Don't they come with a sign? You think they do. Or you interview them and you think, wow, they got perfect grades in college and they're super smart. They east all their questions. So, a players were their grades? Well, they're really smart. Right. And I mean, they're a perfect fit for your company. Why not? I mean, you don't just hire for intelligence? Well, back then, I only did. Wasn't that the Google model? Well, I really thought that hiring for intelligence was the most important thing, but it's really the other non-tangible things. They'll tell me what you want. Like, whether or not they can meet deadlines, whether or not they could build a product with a high level goal in mind, whether or not they could go out and survey the customers themselves, whether or not they could build a product without requiring a full spec that you're given in an engineering assignment in college. And these things, you don't necessarily learn in college. And so, if you were interviewing people today, would you know how to ask those questions? I wouldn't necessarily ask questions to figure that out. How would you figure it out? A lot of these things, you just have to try. You have to bring them in for a few days and just watch them in the battlefield. So did you make any hiring mistakes? I made quite a few. And how do you fix your mistakes? You recognize them, you accept them, and you try to part ways with the person who was a mistake. So you never hired people? So that meant you never fired people either. Right. And I was at. I remember, like a few months after we had raised our million dollars, one angel investor asked me if I had ever fired anyone before, and I probably told him no, I never had to. And he said, well, you shouldn't be smiling because you probably hired someone wrong and you just haven't realized it yet. And that really scared me. And so you've now done that? Right. Like, I feel like if you're a first time entrepreneur, instead of just trying to only make a player hires, maybe it's better to think about hiring in terms of trying and then firing if you realize that you made a mistake. Because that's just inevitable. And you can't really learn who's a good fit until you try lots of people. So it sounds like you fix your mistakes quickly. I have. It's costly not to do that. It's very costly. Well, all the mistakes I made have cost us at least half of funding. Well, it's glad you're still in this. Sorry. That was half my funding, too. So, but Jessica, when you started, there's another piece of this story that I think is kind of interesting. You happen to get a lot of press. And first of all, why was that? What was it like? How did you deal with it? What did you work? Well, getting a lot of presses is a lot of fun. It's really good for the ego, but enough. And why did you get all that press, you think? Well, we had an interesting story. Like, you were 20 and a 20 and a 19 year old building a startup to help business owners and we were fresh out of Y Combinator and we'd raised a million dollars. And it sounds really cool, but after we got a lot of this press, we realized that maybe half of it didn't really convert into signups. So, but the press felt good. Why did you care about signups? It was about you. I thought so. And then I got your phone call. Steve called me after this huge wave of press and said, just, like, you have to really think about what you're doing to yourself and really make sure that when you're getting press, it's actually leading to money, to business results. Because it takes a lot of time to go out and be speaking engagements and talk to reporters. And if it's just about boosting your ego, it's just not a great use of time. It feels good for a while, doesn't it? It does. And then, and then over time, you had a lot of friends saying, it hasn't a narrow, oh, it's probably doing great. I saw you in Ink Magazine or Fast Company. But it really doesn't feel great because deep down inside, you know how hard it is to build your company. And you know that you're not successful yet. So you just feel like a con artist in a way. So did you feel that way for a while? I still feel that way. How come? Because people think you're successful when you're still struggling. And so this brings us back to a funny conundrum. When you were in college and you were thinking about entrepreneurship, and what did you think? I mean, how did you think it worked versus what were the two biggest surprises about how the real world worked as an entrepreneur versus what you thought as a college do? I didn't realize how hard it be. Like, I always write about the success stories. Like all the books you get on Amazon are from entrepreneurs who made it. And you just assume you're going to launch your product, get on tech crunch, and then you're going to see a hockey stick and growth. And then raise a million dollars and then be rich and then buy a Tesla. So I'd wish you did the million dollar part, right? Yeah, well, I thought that life would be great. And it's really, really difficult. And I thought a startup would be a lot of fun because when you hear about your friends joining startups, it's all exciting. But when you're running it yourself, the level of stress you have is just incredible. So tell us about the stress. We had 20-year-old being stressed. I'm really interested. It feels worse than college. And why? What are you responsible for that makes you stressed? Well, you're responsible for your staff, you're responsible for meeting payroll, you're responsible for your customers and not screening that up. You're responsible for your investors. And then on top of that, you have your own career to worry about and your own ego and your parents. And it's far more than just taking home a salary. So you thought you'd get this million dollars and things would go swimmingly well and you'd look like Facebook at the end of year two, right? I did. All right, honest. And it didn't happen, right? I was really, really cocky. I was on top of the world and I thought I'd mastered it all and I was so wrong. And so when did reality set in? What didn't happen that you thought or when did you start going, uh-oh. I think reality set in when that investor I talked about asked me if I'd ever fired anyone before. And after that, I went through each of my staff members and I really thought, is every one playing their weight, is everyone an A player? And if not, like, what did I do wrong or what are they doing wrong or how could you fix that? And I talked that over with my co-founder. We sat down and we really thought about our hiring practices and we thought, you know, we're not moving nearly as fast as we should have been. We're not moving at the pace that we plan to. We weren't meeting our internal goals. And that just felt awful. Yeah, because then you had to fix it. Yeah, you have to fix it. Like, the first person you try to let go, that was just terrible because if I had to just let them go, that wouldn't be so hard to do, but we had a lot of resistance from our other staff. Because everyone in a small startup is close friends to each other and they all like this person. So I had explained to everyone why we were letting them go and then why they weren't at risk themselves of being let go. What? And did you have any help doing this or did you have to figure it out yourself? Well, you could get advice from investors, but ultimately you have to do it yourself. Right. And you have to learn the mistakes yourself. And so the first level of reality was figuring out that you needed to change staff. And then what else, how about revenue and customers and product? What happened when reality met the road? Well, so with hiring and firing, that was just giving the surface. And then it got way worse after that. Wow. And why are you up here? Why? Tell us a story. I think it's great. Yeah, well, after that happened, we had set goals for ourselves for how many users we'd have, for how much revenue we'd be making. And the numbers to even pressive, but a lot of them are just vanity metrics. They sound really good to tech crunch and to ink magazine, but they don't translate into business success. What's an example of vanity metrics? So for example, in an era, I could say it's tracking tens of millions of transactions and billions of dollars of business assets, which is all true. But how many of these users are active and paying money and how much money are they paying? And how loyal are they and are we solving real problems for them? And that's where we really had to. And you were tracking those real numbers as well? Well, I tracked the real numbers too. And they were not as great as I wanted them to be. And so was that something you knew how to fix it? Was it just kind of like you were stuck for a while? I think we were so unhappy during that time period because we kind of assumed that we'd be successful. Like we had raised expectations so high for ourselves that when reality came to us, we had no choice but to feel bad about it. So how long did you guys feel bad? Well, my co-founder and I went through this six month bad of depression. We were just really angry at the world and we were just really upset. And what happened? And like you made personal changes, we cut a lot of our costs. Like you had a really nice office, you got rid of that. Remember that? I do remember that. I remember that conversation. What is your favourite for just for everybody else? What did you learn about fancy offices? Well, I actually read your essay about it before I got that fancy office. I still did it. And I still did it. But what did you learn? Well, I learned that you just feel really scrappy and it's a lot more exciting to feel poor and to feel like the underdog and to set expectations low for yourself. Because when we had that nice office, it wasn't just ourselves. You felt content, but guests would come in and think, wow, in the narrow must be doing well. You have a nice office, you got a hot tub, it's really cool. But it made you feel kind of too content, too, didn't it? Well, I actually felt cool about it for about a month. And then I started feeling like a con artist after that. I felt like I was wasting my investors' money. Checked. I feel really bad about that. Good. So what would your advice be on offices, by the way? I really think this is an interesting thing. I would keep my office in an apartment for as long as possible. So today, our office is an apartment down the hall from my apartment. Cool. And it feels amazing. Because? Because it's cheaper, it's ever you want some small room together. So you really feel like you're in it together. And you have a kitchen, shower, convenience. You're just more productive. No hot tub, though. No hot tub. Right, and so what did you start learning about customers and products? How does it compare to your original idea of what you were building in for who? So I started to realize over time that you wouldn't just get an instant realization and build a product around that and for everything to be successful. When you're starting the company, I would tell my co-founder, Andy, hey, Andy, after a month, we'll have our product out and we're going to be successful. This is it. And you've launched the product and it didn't really help that much. Month later, all right, Andy, this time it's it. You figured out what customers want. We're going to be making lots of money now. And you did that many, many times and that never came. And then my co-founder, Andy, would say, just, I don't think it's just going to happen like that. And it's just going to be iterative and long and slow. And we'll learn new things along the way, but we're not just going to have this overnight realization of what customers want. And you think that's how it's played out now that you kind of learned over time? Well, it took us a long time to figure that out. Interesting. In fact, you mentioned something that I want to go back to, which is launch. And did you do a launch early on? Yeah, we launched really early. Like, we wanted to be the first company out of our light, combinator batch to launch on TechCrunch because we'd feel good about ourselves. And we did. And it felt great. But the product was just not there yet. Like, people would sign up and they'd complain about bugs and problems and they'd fall off. And I wish we had waited longer. Say that last part again. I wish we'd waited longer to launch. And we didn't have to publicly launch to get user feedback. I thought that's what you're supposed to do. Talk to our friends and early customers and had them use the product and just use that for a longer period of time. But you wouldn't have been part of the cool club. You wouldn't have been, but I'd rather not lose your money than people. That's an interesting lesson, isn't it? And could anybody have convinced you do with that early on? Honestly. Possibly, but I felt like there was just a lot of peer pressure to do otherwise. I think so. Like when you're surrounded by a bunch of other companies, we're rushing to launch and your investors really want you to launch. You're just going to do it. Cool. Interesting. So you just have to figure out what you want to do. And even if your investors tell you to do otherwise, you have to decide what's right for you. Well, this is interesting. And we're going to come back to this. You mentioned a couple times your co-founder. So first of all, how important is it you think to have a co-founder? Because you've done this yourself? No. Not at all. I think it's super important to have a co-founder. And I'm so thankful I have one. And why? What do you think you get from a co-founder? Is it just another pair of hands or eyes or something else? Or what is it? It's a real-time sanity check. So on all the decisions I make, my co-founder would often give a different opinion. Like I'd say, oh, this guy's so cool. He's graduated from a top. Well, we should totally hire him. And my co-founder would say, no, you don't want to hire him. Here's why. Or I would just say a bunch of things. And he would just refute that. And I'd say, wow. I think I'd have you. And had you worked together before? We had throughout college together. So you had a working relationship before you did the company. And you knew each other. Yeah. And how do you break ties? How do you divide up? No, how do you break ties? So he says one thing you say another, how do you decide? Well, at first it was who is more charismatic. And that was usually me. I would just come up with a bunch of reasons and tell Andy why he's wrong. But over time, I tended to be more wrong than he is. So- Sounds like a marriage to me. Well, now we default to his decision. And you still like each other? Yeah, we actually got in closer because of it. Interesting. And could you imagine having more co-founders or is to the right number for you? What do you feel like? Two or three might be right. Four feels like it'd be a lot. But it really depends on the people you're working with. And with my co-founder Andy, we're like for best friends. We live with each other. And it just feels right. Cool. And how about you mentioned advisors and as investors, because that's the way you fund the company? Tell me about the type of advice you get, how often do you talk to them? Weekly, monthly, every year? Different types, different times? It really depends on the person. And before we took money from people, we actually would estimate how helpful we thought each one would be. And based on that, we would determine how hard we try to get them in. And I remember you on our list, we thought, impossible to get. So maybe you shouldn't even try. But we're really happy to have you involved. Took one coffee. That was it. I was easy. And so what's the best advice you've gotten from other mentors or other advisors? What did they tell you? I think the best help I get from advisors is the emotional support. It's just knowing that they're there to help. And they're not there to judge. And even if you make mistakes on their dime, they're accepting and they want you to learn. And we realized that the best angel investors and advisors were those who had built their own company before. So they were their own entrepreneur. They worked for themselves. And they didn't feel super strong about one opinion. They always give you both sides to the story and trusted you to decide what was best. And so I really looked for that in an advisor. And now we only have maybe three or four who we speak with on a regular basis. Maybe every few weeks. And then the rest are super busy running their own companies. And so were they helpful in raising a next round of money? Or did you do that by yourself? We haven't raised. Oh, so you just raised a million dollars? Well, it was a little more. But we're still going on that million right now. Great. And do you ever think you're going to need more? Or are you going to be done? Well, when we raised a million, you thought, oh, this is way more than we need. Like, we're totally going to be done on that. In fact, we only sought to raise 500. And we thought that was enough. So what's the lesson in raising money here? It goes by faster than you think. And it's always safer to raise more than to raise less. So if you could have raised, in fact, you probably could have raised more. Should you have taken it? Absolutely. I was offered over a million dollars more on incredible terms. And I should have taken every penny. Because. Because it would give us more time to experiment, to iterate on the product. It would give us more time to make mistakes. Of the million dollars we raised, we had a plan and we thought we would meet each of the items in this plan. But we didn't account for the fact that half that money would basically be spent on founder tuition. And just mistakes we made and other problems. So you think you just kind of underestimated the amount of mistakes in naive vatay that you would burn cash for? Yeah, I completely underestimated that. And you realize it's not just you. I do. Okay. You do now. Well, now I do. Back then I thought I was not going to make the same mistakes. So let me just ask the kind of two interesting questions. One is the, what are the things that people told you that you heard but didn't quite understand versus the second version of the question? What did you hear and did understand and took there? That is, there's two classes of you got advice and you heard it and yeah, but not us. And then you did it anyway versus G, that was good advice and it saved us. Does that, am I making it? Yeah, I think that when you listen to advice, that sounds rational. You don't, you don't just discard that advice because you disagree with it. You justify your circumstance. So for example, your essay on not getting fancy offices. We looked at a bunch of offices that were super fancy and had a guy on the first floor who would open the door and make everyone check in. You know, fancy like chandelier and the lobby and we're like, all right, like Steve told us not to get fancy offices. So we're not doing any of this. But the one with the hot tub, did really fit into that for a while. So you don't really. I'm going to add a hot tub. You don't discard advice. You just justify, you somehow justify around it. Or with Eric Reese's opinion on not launching so early. We didn't discard it, but we justified not following it by thinking, well, it'll allow us to build up PR hype, which will allow us to raise money, which will help us be successful. But by launching too early, you kind of burn your own chance to get a lot of PR. Right. The, the, the, the heuristic there is you don't get the launch twice. Right. You know. And so these sound a lot like rationalizations. Yeah, you just justify it. You're like, you just make me get work somehow. And, and do you think being an entrepreneur now a second time, let's say you did another startup, would advice like that register more? Oh, yeah. Because. Because I mean, I made the mistakes and now it's, it's kind of hard coded into my DNA not to repeat them again. Interesting. Okay. And what, what are some examples of advice you did take that you think were, were useful? And I think not settling on $500,000. Like that was just so easy to come by back back when we raised. And we had one very great angel investor Kevin Hartz from event fright. He said, take more money like this bubble is going down or whatever. Or maybe it will never go down, but what's the harm in taking more money just in case? So I followed that advice I took over a million. And although I should have taken more, it's better than if I had just ignored it. And any other good advice you got from others? Yeah. I'm like hiring and firing on measuring more than just intelligence on just closing angel investors from you were raising money. So we got a lot of good advice that we followed. So maybe we'll just kind of wrap up and then take questions. But for me the most interesting thing is you started a company pretty young in school. Do you think it would have been better if you would have worked for some other startup? At least for you in your case. Right. Or would you still have gone out and become CEO and founder knowing what you know now, how hard and depressing and miserable and whatever? What was your choice? I'm really happy that I went down the strad of entrepreneurship. Because if I had gone, went out to get a job, I'd probably become a better engineer. But I wouldn't have learned about negotiating and hiring problems and dealing with a company budget and figuring out this investor, how to deal with investors. And I wouldn't really appreciate how hard it was to start a company. So I might procrastinate starting a company if I had gone a job. I'd say, oh, I could start a company in a few years and I'll do well and life will be great. And it's easy to say that when you're not running a company. But when you are running a company, you intimately understand how hard it is. And actually when I was going through that six month batter depression with my co-founder, I remember asking him, like, should we have just gone in real jobs? Should we have just returned all of our investor money and gone to work at Google or something? And that was when we really realized that we had to make the startup just fun for us to work in. What if an in-air never makes a profit? What if I could only make payroll and maybe make my investors a little money or not at all and just have fun with it? And now my focus is on enjoying myself, on learning. And I'm a lot happier now that I feel that way. So you would do it again? Absolutely. So with that, I can see. So let's open it up for questions for anybody. And you want to pick? Sure. You want to pick? Hey, Jessica. During our research looking at your background, you hit on a really important area, which is looking at a room full of budding entrepreneurs. What advice can you give them from getting to the idea phase and crossing that chasm into a product that you've learned a lot of lessons. Product got out too early. Is it doing an executive summary? Photoshop started to code right away. I mean, what tips can you give from a cool idea to actually crossing that chasm? So the question was the short version is, what tips can you give from going from the idea into the execution? In middle school, I'd come up with a bunch of ideas for businesses. But I never actually went through with any of them. And I'd put together a business plan or executive summary. And I'd put a lot of time into just planning out this operation. But none of them came through. So in college, when I was starting in an era, I thought, why not take a completely different approach? Why not start with what's the most fun thing to do that would get this in the hands of a potential customer? So instead of coding, we actually started with Photoshop. We put together mock-ups and we brought them to potential customers. And we asked if they thought this would help them in any way. And I felt that by going that route instead of doing the business plan or executive summary route, we just get closer figuring out what people actually wanted. Because I mean, a business plan, if I had to look at our first executive summary and compare that to what we have now, it's completely different. So you can't really proceed based on just a plan. So no business plan survives first contact with customers? No, never. Good. That answer your question. Great. Pick another one. You talked about your corporate culture. When you first started out, did you intentionally try to build any aspects of corporate culture, other than the hot tub culture you met? So the question was about corporate culture. Did you intentionally, when you started out, try to build the corporate culture, or did it just happen? We didn't intentionally think about culture. And that's probably a mistake. You probably have to think a lot more about culture when you're starting off. But we build our company around friends. So we all knew each other and we all had this common culture of feeling like we're in college and we're building this for fun. So it's pretty organic. And so, given what you knew now about hiring and firing, would you have built the friends college culture, or would you have built a different culture? I like the friends and collegial culture, but... Oh, the butts important. What's the butt? But I had a few experiences where I would hire a friend who was really smart, but just not a great fit for the company. And that would just really destroy our relationship. So I'm a lot more careful about that. And so what's the culture today? How would you character it? If I had to give it a label or you give it a label, what would you say your endonero culture is now? The culture right now is kind of like a clubhouse. Like you know how in the basement of your parents' house you set up a little tent and you do stuff in there. That's what endonero is like. But with better employees. Good. You've spoken a lot about the benefits that you got in your investors. Can you talk about some of the negatives we had to give up on the day of your investors? So the question was, you spoke about the benefits of angel investors, but what are some of the negatives? And what do you give up from having angels instead of ventric apples? Well, I'd actually prefer to compare raising money from angel investors against just bootstrapping it yourself. VCs, it's obvious you lose a lot of control and a lot of equity. Angel investors, you lose equity, but not so much control. Some people say it's really difficult to manage investors. I think it's just not something you should worry about. Like most of our angel investors, they're just so busy running their own company that they don't have time to worry about how well or poor we're doing. But comparing it to bootstrapping, I would feel a lot more comfortable if we were bootstrapped. And instead we had like great advisors because there is a lot of pressure to grow the company, to make sure it's not just a lifestyle business that you're happy with. But one that will make a lot of money and I haven't completely figured that out yet. But based on the company we were trying to build, I don't know how we just bootstrapped it in an easy way. And did you get offered venture money? We were offered a little venture money, but we thought it'd just be smarter to take angel money. And why? What we're just thinking is still the same. You were scared about signaling risk. If we went out to raise the VC round, but we had a venture capitalist invested in the company who didn't want to invest in the future, it would just make the company look bad. They didn't want to do a venture round. They wanted to do part of the angel round. Well we weren't raising a VC round. Like you were very adamant about just taking angel money. And why wasn't it? Why didn't you want VC? Because we didn't want to raise expectations for ourselves. We wanted to have the time and luxury of just figuring out who our customer was. And if we have a VC involved, we'd be forced to spend our money on not necessarily the right problems. And I remember we talked about that when we first met. Back in the summer we worked on the company for the first time. I went to Steve asking about raising money. He had actually tried to raise money. And he couldn't raise money. And that was the big reason why we went to Factor School also. And what you said was that by raising money too early, you're likely to waste it on the wrong things. And I didn't really realize that until after we had wasted money on the wrong things. Great. Next question. So you talked about some hiring mistakes that were made where these like full-time equity players and where these contractors, what kind of hiring was the nature of these hiring mistakes? So the question is, you talked about hiring mistakes. What was the nature? Were they full-time employees with equity or were they just contractors or both or? All over the board. Contractors, interns, full-time employees with equity. And it was really hard in every case because there's pressure to move forward. There's pressure to spend your investors' money to make the company grow faster. And by firing someone who isn't top-notch, you're cutting away a lot of productivity. And you want to move fast, but if you get rid of them, and oh well, we're going to have to do a lot more work that we didn't want to do. But that always ended up being the wrong mentality. And so it's just better to fire as soon as we realized it wasn't a perfect fit. So you learned that it was better to have an empty seat than a seat that wasn't fully-produced? Yeah, I mean, I don't need to have my weekends. Like I'd rather have my sanity and just work more to make up for it than have only a half contributor. And were you still able to hire after people knew you were actually capable of firing them? Yeah, of course. And eventually, how did the rest of your organization deal with the fact that you were not going to accept half productivity? People really think about what they're contributing. And everyone bounces back. Like even after a good friend leaves the company, you bounce back. And I feel like you're almost stronger because there are fewer of you. And because you know that you are the right team. Good. Next question. Was it difficult to make your customers talk about what if you have the product product? So the question was, was it difficult to have your customers talk about the product and the quality of the product? It's really easy to get people who love your product to talk about it. It's really, it's a lot harder to get the people who don't like it to talk to you about it. Because they'll use the product and they'll stop using it. And you'll never hear from them again. So we set up a little survey box on our dashboard that asks if they'd recommend in a narrow to a friend. And it's simple, yes I would. No, I think it needs more work. And we measure that every single week. And that's a lot of us to get in touch with the people who wouldn't recommend us and probably wouldn't come back. And so who did you learn the most from? You learn more from people who find the product promising but have a lot of problems with it. The people who don't find it useful at all just aren't the right customer at all. Interesting. And so how do you get a hold of the people who, that middle ground, how do you find them? Well, through the survey and through customer service. So we get hundreds of customer service emails every single week. And a lot of them say, oh, I found out about you guys through so and so magazine. And I couldn't set up my account for x, y and c reasons. And we didn't touch with them and we'd learn a lot just from customer service. So who talks to customers in your company? We have one full time staff exclusively working on customer service. And customer service. But he's not just customer service. He's not just answering support emails. It's a constant learning role. And how often do you talk to customers? Pretty frequently. I'll talk to you at least a few a week. A few a week. What? Before I would talk to a lot more potential customers and get them to be customers. But. Used to be called sales. Well, yeah, but for us it was about usability, testing, and research. But yeah, customer service isn't just about service, it's about learning. Good. Next question. Back. Yeah. So you said you speak with thousands lots of customers. And every customer don't want something from your company. So they're all going to have different priorities and systems. What type of mechanism do you use or what process do you go through? Find out and prioritize what features are going to go in the next iteration here. But also can you come up with an occurrence where a customer is out of pain, customer, a customer, and ask for a feature that you had as often as what you received and how did I go? So there were two questions in that. One is given that you have a series of customers who want stuff from you. How do you prioritize the customer requests? And two is when you had a paying customer or ask for something. But it turned out you couldn't get to their feature. How did you deal with that? So to your first question, I'd say the main processes get out of the building and actually watch them in person use the product. So we didn't have any fancy software or process. It was just email them and say, hey, I want to figure out how you're using it in narrow and how we could make it better. We meet up in person over coffee and a lot of our customers are in San Francisco or in New York. And I live in New York while my parents do. So I get the best of both. And that's always been the best way. The least successful learning we have is on the phone, actually. You can't watch them use the product. You can't watch them struggle. And that's just not as useful. Your second question was about paying customers who want a feature and we've had to turn them away. And we get that quite a bit. We have people who want us to build a feature that would make us too much like an accounting product all the time. And we just have to tell them, remind them that they signed up for in narrow because they wanted simplicity. And in narrow gives them that simplicity. And we can't just build everything for them. We found out that a lot of our customers do ask for valid features. And it's not that we won't build them, but it's that it'll take us three to six months to get around to it. And that's the more difficult scenario. But we found that most of them are pretty patient. They're willing to wait for us to catch up because they believe in the company. So who's the product steering committee in the narrow? Well, it's all of us. It's not really like we vote on features. We talk about it over dinner once a week. We'll take the company out to eat at a restaurant. And we'll go over the problems that customers had. And then we'll just decide, all right, that sounds interesting. I'll work on that. And was there ever a time so far that you've heard enough requests in a place you weren't planning to go where all of a sudden it was clear that you needed to make. Did you make a shift in this area or was that not happening? Yeah, I'd say the biggest example of that is with building a mobile application. I never really felt strongly about doing mobile because I felt that every web startup was just building an iOS or Android app because it was the cool thing to do. But a lot of our customers expect that and demand that. So that kind of brought us on to a different course. Let's take one last question. Is this the best question in the room? Have you noticed any similarities between your company culture when you're employees in the way that they do? Correct. And your customers, whether they value the same things, whether a lot of your employees just can't relate to your customers. So does the company culture relate to your customers? Can they understand your customers? Yeah, absolutely. And I actually meet a lot of entrepreneurs who say that their customers are completely different from who they are and they're not very intelligent or they ask for stupid features and they just don't get it. But I'm really proud to say that our customer base is really smart, really tech savvy, and they get it. And they're really fun to talk to. That's a great sign, Jessica, because when you start hating your customers, you're out of business. So with that, I want to thank you very much for a wonderful time today. Thank you very much.
