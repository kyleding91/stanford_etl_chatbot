 I'd like to introduce Evan Williams. He is our second speaker of the year, and the CEO and founder of ODO. So just to get us all on the same page, maybe you could tell us a little bit, give us a quick tutorial about podcasts. OK, podcasts are essentially audio recordings that are distributed through the web. And the name comes from the idea that they're put on the web, wrapped in an RSS feed, and then subscribed to, and ultimately they end up on your iPod. Or such MP3 player type device. And it started pretty much a year ago, but in that time it's evolving very quickly. There's apples obviously involved now, and Yahoo, and a bunch of other people. And so that's the most generic definition, but I think it's going to change pretty quickly. So why is so exciting? Everybody is jumping in a game. Yeah, it's kind of annoying that way. I think it's exciting for a few different reasons. And there's, I use phrase, the webification of audio is how I like to describe what's happening with podcasting. And audio has been on the web for lots of years, obviously. I remember in 1996 hearing real audio over the web, and really as every few seconds after it would buffer, you'd hear something. And it was pretty amazing experience. And then streaming actually, streaming radio has surprisingly large audience, but it wasn't really a mind blowing, compelling experience for a long time. And right now what's happening is sort of several key pieces of infrastructure and expectations, I guess, got came into place that made the idea really take off. And those pieces were broadband being extremely widespread, so the idea that you could actually download a high fidelity version of audio instead of just streaming it made the experience much better when you're listening. And then obviously with the digital devices, notably the iPod, that millions of people are carrying around. And in fact, they're hooking these two their computers, and you could take this audio and then put it on your device and listen to it wherever you want. Kind of made the idea obvious to a lot of people. And then suddenly, a similar thing happened to what was more or less radio content that happened to print in the early days of web. Everyone suddenly saw, oh, the web is this incredible new distribution vehicle for all this stuff we're publishing. And so that enables lots of things, it enables an explosion of new content. And that's particularly interesting with audio because when you're talking, we say audio generically, but the most interesting stuff in a lot of podcasts is the non-music stuff. Because music distribution is evolved quite a bit. But the radio type stuff, talk radio, or spoken word audio, which can be cover a huge variety of topics, has always been pretty limited and it's just distribution options. So on your talk radio dial, you have very few options for what you can listen to. And so now you have a web's worth of options of what you can listen to. And that's pretty interesting. And then the fact that you can listen to it whenever you want and the puts, like the web, it puts the information consumer completely in control. It's pretty interesting. And then the third promise that obviously was part of the web as well is that anyone can be now be a creator of this content, not just a consumer. It's very interesting. Clearly, this is the early stage of this technology. And I'm sure you look to the future and wonder where this is going. What would be your vision of what are we going to see happening over the next few years? So I think there is a whole other way to come. And right now what we're seeing is really the 1.0, if you will, a podcasting, which is similar to the 1.0 of the web. It's mostly, it's this awesome new distribution vehicle. But the paradigm is still very similar to radio. Most of your description of podcasting, like mine just now, use the term radio, because that's well understood, this is what is recorded and distributed via audio. But and that was a similar to the web. And everything on print moved to the web. Potentially had a greater audience. It was more immediately accessible, it was cheaper. But then things like blogs came around when they did was really the web coming into its own. And the other stuff didn't go away. There's still New York Times and newspapers and magazines. Everything that was in print on the web. But what blogs introduced was it formed a publishing that didn't exist in print and took advantage of the intrinsic qualities of the web, the idea that you could publish several times a day, because it didn't cost you anything. And it didn't cut down any trees, the idea that you could take advantage of the hyperlink and add value in context and make it more interactive in two way with comments and refer logs. And you have this distributed conversation was a whole new type of publishing, one that really made sense for an individual to do as well as a corporation. And it was just a native form of web publishing. So for podcasting, we haven't seen that yet. We're sort of in the pre-geocities phase podcast and where it's not even geocities made it easy for anyone to literally put up a web page. But there wasn't until blogs and some other tools that weren't, it wasn't clear why you do so or how to do so on an ongoing basis. So with podcasting, I think there's that same potential where it's going to evolve to a much more common everyday type use that's not seen as producing a radio program. Those things will still exist. And people will download their NPR. But beside it, they'll have messages from their friends and group conversations or a million different things that we don't even know about yet. So there's also a really interesting competitive landscape that's evolving. Every day, you pick up the newspaper and see another organization like Yahoo this week getting into the game. Maybe you could tell us a little bit how you view the competitive landscape right now. Sure. It's tricky. I mean, if we certainly didn't necessarily expect when we started thinking about podcasting a year or so ago, before we actually heard the term, my co-founder was doing had a service called AudioBlogger. And I did a deal with him when I was at Google to let people publish audio to their blogs. And then we kind of stumbled across a similar idea, like lots of other people did, of letting you download it to your device. We didn't necessarily anticipate that it would be one of the fastest growing spaces. And even by internet time, that big company is like Apple and Yahoo and AOL. We're going to get into it within the next year. And that's actually kind of unheard of from concept to the big players in the game. And on the one hand, that's obviously a little bit scary because we thought, well, we're going to solve these problems and be a leader in the space because we're small and start up and focused. On the other hand, with any emerging market, at first, it's a lot of it's about growing the pie and bringing more people into the fold. And it's, if I were to compare it to blogging again, for years, we were trying to explain what it was and defend its legitimacy and podcasting. Suddenly, those guys are out there educating the market and getting all the big players in and getting millions of people accepting this form of media. Then arguably, it's a lot easier to build on top of that and to do the really interesting things if you aren't fighting the fundamental education battles. So do you view them as competitors or collaborators? A little bit of wolf. I think they're obviously competitors to a certain extent. It depends on who they are. And there's lots and lots of people in the space. But the big guy is Apple and Yahoo now. On the face of it, they're competitive and we offer similar services. We also haven't yet launched fully the version of our service that is more unique and they're not doing it. I think it's going to be more our key, which is the creation of audio. But Apple has also made our job easier because at first, we had this client program. You had to download audio to your machine. You have to first install something before you really got the full benefits of our service. And now you can use iTunes and they work together. So it's not a clear line, but I think long term is going to be more good than harm. Fabulous. So you refer before to being a Google. And I know you have a very exciting past as a serial entrepreneur. Maybe you could just tell your story briefly because I think everyone here will be fascinated at how, well, why a guy like you decided to leave Google, but what were you doing beforehand? Sure. I have started a few companies. The first was when I was about 20 and it was in Nebraska. And actually had a spin off of that company was an internet company. So I had an internet company in late 93, early 94, through 96 in Nebraska, which was the right time with the wrong place. And I was pretty much spent a lot of time I was trying to raise money and explaining what the internet was, was step one. And again, it's about educating the market. And that was really difficult, but also highly educational. That was basically my education and did absolutely everything wrong and learned a lot. And then finally made it out to California. Those companies didn't really go anywhere. It shut them down basically. 96 did some web, internet consulting, whatever. And then came out to California in 97, worked for O'Reilly Media, which was an O'Reilly and associates the book and web and conference publishers. And that was very brief. Didn't find it very palatable working for other people. So I did mostly independent contracting for a year and a half building web applications. And knowing I was going to start another company. And at the end of that time, started a company, early 99, called Pyro Labs. And wasn't the purpose of the company, but we ended up building a tool called Blager, which we launched in January 1999. And it was one of the first easy web logging tools and sold that to Google then in February 2003. How long were you Google? As a Google for a year and eight months, and basically was an engineering and product manager there running Blager. It's interesting. I think I know some statistics have been. Someone sells their company to a bigger company. It's usually they last about nine months. So you last a longer than most. That sounds about right. I mean, it's a really hard thing to do. Certainly, some people, I know who sold their companies to Google in any case, have enjoyed staying there. But it's certainly a different personality that then builds a company. And then even if they're not different personality start with, by the time they've built through a company and had the level of success where they've actually sold it, then being part of merging into someone else's culture can be a really challenging thing. I had never been particularly good at lining up to someone else's organization. But I also went into it knowing that I was going to learn a tremendous amount from Google and be able to operate at a higher level when I got out there. So I wanted to get as much as I could. So obviously, Google is a very fast, paste, high growth entrepreneurial organization as so is your company. How different is it being in a really small startup, as opposed to a big startup? Well, if pay for your own food, the take out the trash, it's not tremendously different. It's a very different experience, of course, founding a company and working in a company. So there's that difference as well as the difference of size. And at any company, there's lots of different experiences. So there are certainly small entrepreneurial teams at Google and other companies that feel a lot like startups. Even when I was at O'Reilly, I worked in their software group. That was almost a startup, like a 25 person startup within O'Reilly and had very little to do with what the rest of the company did. So it's not necessarily that much different, but founding a company is certainly a world of difference than going into a company with all kinds of resources. And you don't have to worry about so many things that are just annoying things that you don't want to think about. And when you start a company, you don't think about it. You want to build a product or you have a great business model idea or something and you have to figure out what are the, what are you going to do for health insurance. So if you look around this room, I'm going to guess that a very large percentage of these folks here are aspiring entrepreneurs. And if you were their age and sitting in their seats, what advice do you wish you had had? Well, I never had any trouble taking risks. That wasn't a particular problem I had. I was always hallucinogenically optimistic about my own abilities. So it's a very tough line to tow. And in some cases, well, I should have been more realistic, but then I may be wouldn't have started or tried a lot of things I tried and granted a lot of them failed. So maybe I shouldn't have, but they were crucial for the ultimate path. So I would say definitely try things, but start small and think big. So one thing that I realized in looking back at a lot of things I've tried is they didn't have enough focus, essentially. And you can do lots and lots of things. If you do one, I think you and I were talking about this, doing one at a time is the easiest way to do lots and lots of things. And I still have that problem today, I think. We started out with my current company trying to do too many things. And you just get this idea that you can do all these things. And you kind of forget, especially with the web, and if you're an internet company, there are so many people in the world solving a very tiny problem can actually turn into a really big company. And if you solve a really small problem, which is obviously much easier and you can do much faster, then you can always build off of that. So that's a big thing that I see time and time again that people are trying to solve too many problems and say, start with a very small and start with something that you care about, that you want to exist in the world. And that was the only types of companies or products that I could ever get excited about and really put my heart into and make successful were things that I had a real need for. I wanted to be a user of the product. And that has its limits. If you want to have millions of users in your technical, at least savvy, then you have to kind of temper that. But at least you want something you want to exist in the world as a user, not just, oh, I think there's a big market here. One thing that happened, I mean, blogger had its ups and downs. One thing that happened in late 2000 when we, and lots of the dot columns were running out of money was there was a very common scenario where consumer facing companies, web companies would decide their enterprise facing web companies. And we had serious debates about that internally. And everyone thought, well, that's where the money is. There's no money in consumer. And that's how we can save the company. And I always thought, well, but that's not what we want to create in the world. So that may or may not be a way to save the company. But even if it was, we're not going to be good at it, because we don't really care about it, and we don't understand it. So let's stick with the thing we care about and understand. And ultimately, fortunately, I would see you. So I prevailed in that decision and turned out to be to work out. That's great. Now you refer before to the fact that you've got to take a lot of risks. But the flip side of that is you're going to have some stumbling and some failures along the way. Would you be willing to share with us very intimate group? Some of your biggest failures. And what you learned from them. There's so many. You got to tell, right? No. Biggest failures. Well, my first company actually started with my father. And that was a disaster from day one. And we did so many things wrong. And he never really worked. He was a farmer, actually. And we were a publishing company that turned into an internet company. And I had never worked in a company. So we had no models for really even how things got done. And one of the biggest, I guess, is more of a symptom than a specific failure. But the cause many problems was just a lack of defining the roles about who did what. And that's something I've repeated several times. And when you have co-founders, and it's not, if you don't have the classic, she's the engineer and he's the business guy or whatever it is, then there's often you want to start things with people a lot like you. And then you find you overlap a lot. And then you're unclear about who does what. And at first, it's fine because you're both doing everything and collaborating. And as you start to get people and you start to need to be more efficient and be focusing on things, it gets really messy. So I've certainly done that. So is that sort of the team building understanding how to put together the right team at the beginning? It's not just putting together right. Even with the people you have, you can have a great person. But it's about actually taking the time to say, you're in charge of this and this. And I'm in charge of this. And of course, we'll collaborate about big decisions or pull each other in. But even if you have the exact same skill set, you need to say who's in charge of what, if there's more than one founder, not a clear hierarchy about who's in charge, that's a big one. So at ODO now, we've now jumped ahead. That was your first experience. This is your most recent one and you have a lot of experiences under your belt. What do you see as the biggest challenges now? Is it internal? Is it organizational? Is it structural? Is it technology? Is it the market? You know, where are the current companies? Yeah, current companies. Where do you see the biggest challenges? Essentially, I think one of the biggest challenges, if not the biggest, is maintaining focus. And again, what the focus issue, which was certainly a problem early on for me. But now, I have to be much more disciplined because a lot of the diversions come externally. They're not just me saying, oh, I shouldn't look shiny thing. I think there's other people and opportunities. And now that I have enough connections, enough visibility to be... To get access to lots of opportunities, it presents the new problem of having to choose. And having to choose really great opportunities that you don't follow is really hard. And it relates also to a starting out, trying to do too many things, because we thought, oh, we can create... We can solve all these problems because no one else is doing it. And that was sort of a symptom of the market moving extremely fast. But even if we wanted to do all those things, we should have done fewer. And so we actually... There's a front page business section store in New York Times when we announced the company. And we weren't launching a product. And that just caused tons of destruction. And destruction from very interesting people. NPR was calling us and VCs were calling us and CNN was calling us. And it's really hard to see, say no to those people. And yet, if I answered all those calls, then we never would have gotten any product built. Interesting. Well, I want to make sure... I remember last week, the audience was filled with so many exciting questions. I certainly don't want to dominate all the question asking. So let me open it up to all of you and see what questions you have for Evan. So, who's got a question? Nobody has a question? There we go. Yeah, please. Hi, I'm Sheldon. Hi, I'm Joe. You talked about, you know, sort of that lost future in the podcast. You know, you know, it's pretty good for us to know where he got some more of that. But I'm just just reaching these goals. They come everywhere. Sure. So, the way I see it, the thing that made web publishing be a mass, everyday, regular person phenomenon, was moving from this idea that we're publishing and creating content to really enabling communication and personal expression. And it's not in either or. I see as there's a continuum of, sorry, on the web's content to communication and in podcasting maybe broadcast to communication. But the same forms and same mechanisms are used on the web and with these different technologies to do very different things. So, one of the things that at first when blogs were being talked about quite of it in early 2000, we're still defending the concept that a regular person should be even be publishing. It was like the goal to think that people would care and they have something to say that the world would tune into. Some people still have that perspective, but I think it's much more accepted now that if that having a place that you publish and it may be read by 10 people and it's just your ideas or you're communicating with a very specific group or you're just saying what's on your mind is much more accepted idea now because it's kind of gotten away from that idea that you're publishing and you're trying to compete with time-warner and with podcasting, I don't think we're there yet, but I think we will be. So we need to get past this idea that you're creating a radio show because that's very intimidating and sure there's lots of people in the world who want to be the next Howard Stern, but not nearly as many as there are people who want to communicate with their family and maybe send short little messages or to a defined group or it could be 100 people, but get away from the idea that you're producing some content or broadcasting. So imagine lots of different scenarios that almost blur the lines between podcasting and voicemail. Think about it in the future, lots of people are enabling and talking about moving podcasts to your phone and you could also imagine getting a message and it's maybe only two minutes long and a lot of podcasts are a half hour long or an hour long and if you're downloading them transferring to your iPod and whatever then selecting them to play then there's a certain format length that makes sense and maybe a two minute thing doesn't make sense, but if you're getting it on your phone and you see it there then it may make sense, but that two minute message could be from ESPN about it's the latest tour de France update because you're following that and you get it throughout the day or it could be a message from your friend to three other friends and it's almost very similar to voicemail. And so there's lots of different scenarios like that or you could have a private channel and you're communicating with your company or your startup or you could be just recording the PTA meeting and putting it out there publicly but for a very defined group of people who are interested and it's just a recording of a communication that enables just more people to get this information. So part of that's about expectations, about what you're actually doing and part of it's about enabling the tools that make it so easy that it's worth doing in a casual way. Interesting. Another question? Yes, back there. I was wondering what the video is. Is this small or is it just so much about private content? It's right in the middle or is it good at climate risk or just reading on the way for how to get about the app on the site? Good question. Right now we're focused on building a user base. We think there's going to be a lot of value in that. It's not blind. Let's collect all the users we can and sell. We think there's many options. And a lot of people are talking about the advertising model for podcasting which if you have the radio paradigm makes a lot of sense. The US radio markets, $20 billion and reportedly those guys are pretty desperate and losing their audience as everyone's carrying around iPods and losing demographics that they're interested in and that's only in the US and obviously it's a worldwide thing. I think there's going to be an interesting market for premium content that doesn't necessarily exist today. So you have audiobooks or audible.com that takes books and turns in a podcast and one more other stuff. But I think there's an interesting tier that would be self-service kind of premium content that could be an expert who's an author or a speaker or just hasn't been on certain things and maybe has already built an audience. So I think people will pay for certain content. Our model could be a combination of those and I think on the publishing side which is the new tools we're about to release. It fits very well with the subscription model where the same type of thing that people pay for already a lot on the web is when you're talking about communication and personal expression people pay and that's what the cell phone market is basically both your monthly bill and people's ringtones are mostly about communication and personal expression. That's something people traditionally pay for especially younger demographics more than content. So there's a lot of ways we could grow the service if we're enabling that to whether it's more powerfully communicate and express yourself. So I like the subscription business but we don't have anything in place right now. Yeah. Good question. Timely question being Apple just released the video I pod today. I think video is interesting and a lot of the same things are going to happen to video. There's going to be a webification of video as there is with audio. Certainly the future where all videos on demand and comes over IP is coming. So you have the way I look at video is like different mediums. This kind of like the web is the most evolved medium and if you use an RSS aggregate you kind of get a picture of with the same mechanism you're reading CNN and your friends blog that's published to 10 people and that's the right mix of content for everybody and they pick the little things and there's a few big things and in front of my TV and the future I expect to sit down and there's a menu of options and there's the amazing race and there's a video of my nephews first steps. So those are sort of the trends that I think are inevitable and going to affect video like they affected the web and are affecting audio. Portable video to me is slightly less interesting. It doesn't have a lot of the advantages that I'm excited about audio for. Part of why I got really excited about podcasting was it's been a really underserved medium and audio and there's just been a dearth of options of what you could listen to at any given time. If you're talking information based content it was inconvenient even audiobooks inconvenient somewhat expensive and even compared to print before the web you could go to your new stand and get hundreds of options and you can't get that for audio and yet audio is arguably the most ubiquitous medium because you're already pretty saturated in front of your computer and in front of your TV and when you're driving around working out, walking down the street, audio is the only type of media you can consume for the most part at least safely and that's in the video I probably actually kind of worries me in that respect. You know people are going to be driving down the road with that. So it's I think it's not quite as exciting but definitely it's going to be a big thing. Any other questions? Went back? You talked about how the flight also seemed to happen? That was my question. Do you phone at here often airing about its actual size and areaza. So, that's a really good question. I probably don't have tremendous insight to that because there are certainly the, it's sort of a cliche that the entrepreneur doesn't, isn't the same person who can really scale something and isn't the same person who can happily work in a bigger company. But then on the scaling side, there's obviously the examples of Bill Gates and Michael Dell and Larry and Sergey. And obviously those type of people exist. And in their cases, maybe it was, they had on something and did lots of really right things that created a massive company and they didn't want to leave it because it was fun and exciting. And then there's other cases where the founder basically needs to be replaced by a more of a professional manager who takes the coming to the next level. So I think it is sort of a personality thing, but I don't buy into very many specific buckets of personalities. I'm sure you can find analysis. There's this type of entrepreneur, this type, and this type. I would like to think that I have the ability to build a big company and scale it. That's not proven yet. Whether or not I'd want to, I don't know. I think a lot of it has to do with just desire as well. What interests a lot of people who build things is the invention part. Other people just like the idea, they turn their invention mindset to inventing the company itself at a larger scale. I'm just going to chime in with a question here. Ask you a question that I get asked all the questions time, which is, can you teach entrepreneurship? Do you think that the skills you have or some of them could have been taught? Sure. I think the only thing that can't be taught is really the strong desire. To me entrepreneurship is just a combination of some skills, most of which I didn't have when I started, and just intense desire. And the more you have the desire, the more your ability to overcome the lack of skills or other obstacles. So being a good entrepreneur I think is being a good worker. It depends on what exactly you're doing, but being a good manager can be taught, I think. And certainly whatever field you're in, that knowledge or expertise to do something successful in that field can be taught. Great. No, it's not. Yep. Hi. My name is Olivia. And you mentioned that all you would get was between the one that has had that third opportunity where you understand you get that in that field. And although you get a little bit of that supply, there's a high probability that all you would get is about the same amount. But when you analyze the retention of any field, which should also be prepared for it, also set back that you find in the confidence and the low, then you're going to be setting the audio media. What set set back is you're pretty good at it? Setbacks to adoption of audio. Is that not my way to say it? It could be that there's not a really huge audience for spoken word audio because people are either, it just doesn't fit into their lives, a lot of people's lives. That could be a setback. But there's, when I think of the path that we're on now in enabling communication and personal expression, I think the biggest setback could be if it's too hard to do, which I think is one of the advantages of audio that can actually be really easy to do. I think people have an insatiable and ubiquitous desire for communication and personal expression and more ways you enable that as long as it's easy are going to be adopted in ways that we can't really anticipate. I'm sure there's other setbacks like the servers don't scale and stuff. But as far as the trend in general, I'm pretty confident. As I said, I'm always hallucinogenically optimistic. Okay. What are the important things? How do you play game users? Do you have an architect who would and what do you do to make the name for the user to look like typewriter? How do you get a user? So how do you, how do you gain users? I think it depends a lot on what your product is. I like the type of products that don't require a lot of marketing in themselves. We're very fortunate. With blogger, we were able to get millions of users without any proactive marketing. Mostly it was combination word of mouth and press and word of blog, if you will. But we created a tool that led people to talk to more people. They talked about that tool and there's a little power by blogger. It was the definition, the typical viral web thing. Odio will hopefully be that as well. So we're not planning for lots of marketing. Different types of companies, though, do need more proactive marketing and distribution deals and advertising. Advertising, I think, is a last resort unless you have millions and millions of dollars or if you're a direct response company. Image advertising, unless you're spending lots and lots of money is generally a bad idea for a startup. And why we picked an Amodeo, most people like the Amodeo. We picked it at just brainstorming. It's my favorite type of name because it's unique. It doesn't mean anything. It's not generic. It's not like audio blogger, which we happen to own. But I didn't name that. It doesn't mean something exactly, but it connotes the right thing. So it's like audio and it's like voice and it's short and we're able to buy the domain. Right? Yep, back there. Then your name. One, two. So there's been a lot of activity recently last, and so I'm not talking about marketing. I've been there to see your reviews on the world of marketing. Other, you see how things like high-speed and the high-speed, you see your reviews on the blog, and that's where we need your system. Or as a company, as a CEO, or a CEO. I think it's not yet an ecosystem. Hopefully it will be. I think there's a really nice ecosystem in the blogging world and most of the tools interact with each other. By its nature, podcasting is pretty open, and there's not a lot of exclusive deals. You can put your audio feed in iTunes, for example, and you can mix and match these things, but there's not enough diverse players to make an ecosystem. I think there's lots more tools and it just has to evolve a lot more. It's not rich enough. There's not a lot of, in the blogging world, for instance, you can plug lots of different things into your blog and you can go as far as you want in terms of complexity. You can, right now, it's pretty generic and flat in the podcasting world, but I think that's just because it's new. I don't think people are competing that much either. Apple introduced lots of people to podcasting. They put this thing on their desktop and they didn't steal any customers for the most part. They just put it in front of them and Yahoo will probably do the same thing. There's so many people out there in front of so many people that interact with each other. Hell, there's 100 million people or at least 20 million people listening to podcasts. There's not a lot of competing, exactly. There's competing for Mindchair, which is a different thing that exists too at this level. When we, early on, we were like one of the few podcasting companies that had any attention at all and therefore we were getting lots of requests for partnerships and we're getting lots of media. We're still getting that, but now people talk about podcasting and Apple before it's audio, obviously. That matters, but it doesn't matter as much as the users. Do you have a question? Yeah. I think it's a little bit about how rights are being made around content for people. Taking you to kind of sort of be in public a little bit by podcasting with public leaders because they don't know where how that rights might seem. Most of them, the ones that are used, the ones that aren't. You talk about sort of your boss and how it evolves and also the audio is sort of taken to stand on that side. Yeah, I'm not an expert on the copyright issues, especially as the big music companies see them. Obviously, they're pretty protective of their content that is coming up in the podcasting world. Our stance right now is don't take anything that's not yours. There should be some fair use, but we're not focusing on that use case. Exactly. I've seen on music in general because, like I was saying, music is a lot more highly evolved. I think there's really interesting music podcasts, and it's a great venue for a lot of independent artists. Eventually, the bigger labels are going to get into it, just music on subscription or music selected by people I trust and just land somewhere. iPod is a really cool idea. I'm going to let other people fight those battles on the licensing front. What I would love to do is, in audio and you want to publish a music, and you opt in to pay a fee if there is one, or we're able to provide some blanket license. But we're not focusing on that right now. So I'm going to go up and see all the problems with an original robot in a lot of experience. How do you say you can get, and you have to make a lot of history, and you can start to do it. The limits to what you can take in. Get that question a lot. I think it's a couple of things are going to happen. I think a lot of podcasts are going to get shorter, at least the popular ones, and there's still this idea that a podcast is a half hour long. And some of them will be, and if you have a half hour commute every day, and it's like that's your morning radio show, and that's what you do, and maybe millions of people will listen to some of those. But where I'm more intrigued is more on the communication side. So it's more frequent. I got something that's a few minutes long, and I'm going to find the part of my day that it fits in, and it's going to be otherwise unused time. So it's not that I'm sitting front on my computer, and I could be reading, because reading is a more efficient way to gather information. At least if it's kind of public information. It's not necessarily a more efficient way to hear something from someone in my family, or my girlfriend, because there's a lot of information that comes through the voice. And just the idea of asynchronous audio is really convenient if I can get it at different times, or when I can't read something, or I'm driving. There's a lot of time when you can't read. So it's taking advantage of that time that is enabling people to take in more information, not just saying, well, I can only listen to a podcast today that is interesting to me. I don't know if that answer made sense. Yeah. Can I follow up on that question? One of the issues, when you look at websites, you can scan them early quickly, and see which ones of these are interesting. It's really hard to scan audio. That's true. It's a lot longer. Just as companies like Google figured out ways to sort through lots of volumes of websites and to give you things that they think are the most relevant, are the same sort of tools evolving for audio? Oh, right. I think the tools are going to get a lot better. I think that the content is going to get better, and I think the tools are going to get better. And search is one of those tools if you're looking for something specific. But I think even getting more information about what you're listening to when you're listening to it, if you look at the iPod as a device for consuming information-based content, isn't ideal right now because the interface is designed for music. And if you are listening to music, especially your own music library knowing the artist and the song, at most, is all you need to know. So there's very little information in there, and you very rarely fast forward your music. And you can imagine an interface display for listening to information-based audio that is quite a bit different. That maybe allows you to see the different sections. And they're starting to do some of this with in iTunes and some other players where you can see, well, here are the chapters. But I can imagine that evolving a great deal. So you can see, well, at this point, it's talking about exactly this. I'm just going to jump there and make it more linear in easier ways to delve into different parts of that. Now, on top of that, I think remixing and allowing other people to add value or help select things is going to evolve. So instead of just subscribing to this show, and it's a half hour every day, I'd much rather subscribe to people's viewpoints, sort of like I do in the blogging world. I still read mainstream media, but I don't generally go to them first. I go to the people whose viewpoints and opinions I respect, and are out there reading articles and other blogs. And then I get there take, and if I want to know more than I go on, those tools don't exist yet. And in podcasting, just the ability to maybe quote the relevant part of this half hour or show, and it's three minutes long. And then someone I respect gives some commentary around that. Could make it much, much more efficient to get what you want. And if these things are broken up into much smaller chunks, and I get the combination of 10 things that are three minutes long that are most relevant to me as opposed to one 30 minute thing, I think that'll improve. Yeah. I know one of my pet peeves. I've started listening to a lot of books on my iPod. So when I go hiking, I'll download a book, and I get to listen to it. And often I want to highlight something. I want to put down the corner. I want to be able to cut a piece of it out and say, gee, I want to remember that quote, but it's impossible to do. That's another big part of what I'm talking about in the evolution of, you can't do that on radio. And we're still with this radio idea. So the whole idea of interacting with the content in any way is very primitive right now. So you can't do any of those things. You can't send them. You can't share something. You can't quote anything. You can't book market. In some cases, you can book market, but you can't see what's coming up next. All these things are possible, but they just weren't built into the old paradigm. So I think we're not there yet. Great. We'll look to you to do it. Who has more than other questions? Yep. If you found that certain podcasts have become more popular than others and are more useful than wondering, they still work on a lot of these things. Certainly, there are some that are tremendously more popular than most. And there's a power law at play, like in most mediums. The qualities they share, I don't know, I haven't studied that too much. It seems to be, in a lot of cases, they come from known entities with built-in audiences. So this week in tech is one of the most popular ones since from Leo Laporte, who had a popular show in tech TV, and Adam Curry, of course, and one of the first. But I think one of the things I find at least is that they're highly list-n-able. Some of the most popular ones are from people who are in media or have been in media and either in radio or TV and know how to make something list-n-able. Tech TV is an hour long or this week in tech, but you can hang out and listen to it. And it's not, some podcasts are very painful. It's interesting because we all are learning to write as we grow up and we're learning to speak, but not necessarily. It's a different thing when you sit down in front of a microphone. And it's a skill that needs to be developed that a lot of people have. And there aren't that many models for it either. So that's again why I'm very interested in the communication and personal expression aspect because if I'm leaving someone a voicemail or need to tell them something, I don't have any trouble talking, but if I'm supposed to sit down and monologue in front of a microphone, I'm very painful to listen to as well. And that's probably a common aspect. A lot of the most most list-n-able ones and most popular ones are conversations. And people talking rather than an individual sitting down and trying to talk. You know, so interesting that we were just talking the other day in our office about in the early days of voicemail or answer machines, people got really nervous leaving messages. So you had to learn how to do that too. So this is a new tool that people actually have to learn how to speak in a form that's appropriate for a podcast. Absolutely. And so a while there that people were really out of practice writing to messages to someone else. Between kind of the decline of letters in the rise of email, then that kind of had to be learned. And you still have your family member who sits down to write email like they're writing a letter and they're just not in the frame of that. There's a whole different etiquette that will evolve for this meeting. Which is really interesting to think about. Yeah. And it gets tremendously early and all these things are great questions because you start thinking about how little it's evolved so far. So any other questions? Yeah, go ahead and do the back. Yeah, I was wondering, yeah, did you share a little bit of your experience in bloggers? This time, I thought you probably experienced a few of the growth there. Did you share with some of those experiences and what you did there? Did you have the media, the concerns, or any remarkable answers for one day on the day? Sure. So on the technical side, it sounds like you're asking about mostly. So the experience in blogger was a roller coaster. I mean, we got funding. We started in 1999 and we're self-funded and raised a little bit of money in early 2000, actually in April 2000. And everything was going great and we had lots of buzz and started building our team and had some great investors and we're going to raise more money at the end of 2000, which was not a good time for consumer-facing internet company with no revenue model to raise money. So that didn't work out. Fortunately, it didn't raise a lot of money in the first place. We only raised a half million dollars, so we grew to a total of seven people and were able to scale down. It was very painful and terrible and had to lay off the seven people, including myself. But the advantage of that was I was able to keep going and I basically kept the thing alive myself. And so 2001 was a very down year and was able to kind of bootstrap and get it going again. But there were scaling problems the whole time. I was part of what made it really painful. We had no money and we had more and more users every day. So it's a weird experience to have your product be more successful and your company just going down the drain. And we did creative things like ask our users for money to buy servers and we went and bought servers and they gave us money because they liked the service and that saved us at one point. And scaling was always probably our biggest problem on the technical side. Partially is because I wrote a lot of the code and I don't know what I'm doing in that room. But as part of my principles, if you don't know how to do something, there's no reason not to do it because when all the programmers left, then when I had laid them off, I went into the server and learned how to administer Linux because there was no one else to do that. And fortunately, there weren't a lot of hackers attacking me at that time. But it was hard. One thing things I'm doing differently now is raised a lot more money. Not sure if that's a good or a bad thing yet, but it's allowed us to scale a lot better and we were not going to have, basically we were terribly underfunded the whole time for what we were trying to do and know a lot more about engineering enough to hire people who are good. So that helps. We have yet to get to the really hard problems of Frodea. So interesting. The way the question was asked, the assumption was that blogger had grown really fast. And obviously, internally, there was a very different thing going on that would then what the rest of the world saw. So that's really interesting. I think we are just about out of time. And oh, do we have time for one more question? One more question. How do you find the small problem? One thing that always annoyed me, I read a lot of books on how to start a company and so forth. A lot of them give this rule of finding the problem and solve it, which I actually kind of said earlier. And I actually don't like that rule because a lot of things aren't problems you're trying to solve. So blogger, in retrospect, we can say we try to solve the problem of easily publishing little bits of things to a website. No one was having that problem when we started it. And similarly, Walt Disney, what didn't set out to solve the problem of not enough animated mice. So some companies go out to set a very small problem. Google, it's impossible to find anything on the web. Let's solve that problem. But that's not framing the question differently. It can help. And it's easier to say, well, this is a problem. But some of the more imaginable, more interesting things are problems you just think they'd be cool. So I think that's hard to say how to do that. It's a matter of just, I have a guy who works for me, Biz Stone, who is just constantly all day long talking about, well, we should do this. And we should do this. He has one of these. Or in the future, there's going to be light bulbs in your shoes or something. And once in a while, he has a great idea. So it's kind of throwing a lot of stuff out there and saying, would I like that? Not would people like that, but would I like that? I think is the question to it. I'd ask. So keys to have lots of ideas. Lots of ideas. Right.
