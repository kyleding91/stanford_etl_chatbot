 You are listening to the Draper Fisher-Jurvinson entrepreneurial thought-leader seminar, brought to you weekly by Stanford Technology Ventures program at Stanford University School of Engineering. We are thrilled today to have Michael Goldberg here. For those of you who don't have a handout who are listening to podcasts or watching online, I just want to let you know that Michael is a partner at More Davin Elementary's. He has a very extensive background as both an entrepreneur and an investor. And we're going to hear a lot more about this during this interview. My plan is to interview him for a good part of the hour, but I will certainly leave time at the end for everyone to ask questions. So Michael, I want to start out with a little bit about your background. It's really interesting. We're looking at a room full of students who are probably mostly scientists and engineers, and you studied philosophy in school. You studied philosophy and then you got your MBA. But now you have become an expert in life sciences and have been involved in life sciences in many different roles. At what point did you decide to specialize and how did you do that since you didn't study this in school? Well, I guess since I went to Stanford as well, the purpose of a great education is to learn how to learn. And of course, in the next 25 years of your career, which is the duration that I've been out of the business school, I've had to relearn lots of things. And some of those things were a little far afield from what I was trained at before I got to them. My interest in life sciences really had to do with trying to pick a career that would put me in the path of progress over the course of it. And biotechnology was just beginning to emerge from the university laboratories had not yet gotten into commercialization mode, although venture back companies were just beginning to be formed. And it was really an interest in being able to participate in an industry that was going to be doing something that made some contribution to improvement of human condition that attracted me to it. And then I found, fortunately, a lot of very, very generous and patient graduate students and other departments at Stanford who helped tutor me. Well, obviously you have leveraged that very, very well. You have been involved with life sciences from many different perspectives, cancer, treatment, health insurance, software and medical settings. Do you need to be a domain expert in each of these areas or are there some skills that you need that basically cover all of them? It's a really good question. I think in many regards, even though I'm a specialist in life science investing and in life science company for nation, I'm a generalist with respect to how that really all comes together in the context of new companies and emerging technologies. And I think there is a very positive interaction and network effect on the healthcare system, different healthcare system elements and how they all work that affects virtually any company that I'm involved in. As you all know, as consumers of healthcare, it's a very complex, multi-constituent system that we've gotten in the United States. And as a consequence, understanding each one of those constituencies is important in terms of designing new products for any of those constituencies. Interesting. Well, I want to do a deep dive into one chapter of your experiences. You started out at one point in a career as a venture capitalist. And then you left to go found a company and spent nine years building that venture before selling it. Maybe you could tell us a little bit about it because from our discussions, I know it's a pretty fabulous story. Well, even before then, I was an entrepreneur. So I was five years as an entrepreneur before I joined a Silicon Valley-based venture firm by the name of Seven Rose, which had started Compact and Lotus and was one of the most successful firms investing through the 80s and still continues to be very successful. I was hired in to help establish presence for them in the biotechnology and life science field. And in the course of that, because they were doing early stage investing, as we do at more David Allen and I do personally, we were focused on really incubations and seed stage ideas and series A, Financing's largely. I had an idea to start a company focused on service delivery for new cancer medicines. One of the impacts of recombinant DNA on development of new cancer therapies was an exponentially large number of new medicines being introduced into a very inefficient distribution channel. And I was enamored with trying to solve that supply demand imbalance. In that connection, while a venture capitalist, I had the freedom to spend some time working on it and became so enamored that I asked my partners if I could take a seed investment and go out and get the company started. What I didn't expect to happen is that once I did that, that the doors quickly shut and were bolted behind me. So I have a great appreciation that it really takes. They didn't had no interest in my doing this as a continuing to do it as a project in the context of the firm. But if I was willing to pound the table and walk out on my career as it might have been there at that time and start this, they were comfortable doing it. So that's what I did as a sole company founder, which has pluses n minuses associated with it. I encourage everybody who's going to be thinking about starting a company here to do it with at least a co-founder because it's a lonely, lonely and difficult road. But what we started doing at Axion was developing services for bridging the gap between new cancer medicines under development that were biotechnology, protein-based, macro molecules, and transforming the distribution system to get them to what ultimately became, in our case, 50% market share in the United States and over 90% of the medical oncologists who treat cancer patients in the country. That was a short explanation of how we developed and what we developed into. And by the time we got to about a $200 million revenue rate, we became very attractive to the largest player then in the cancer medicine field that was Bristol Myers Squib. Today, it's Genentech. And I understand several weeks ago you had the privilege of having Kim Poppeth too was senior executive at Genentech here. But at that time it was Bristol Myers Squib. It's interesting just parenthetically. The time I was starting my career, Genentech was pre-revenue venture capital fund. It started up. And you know, Bristol Myers was probably a $5 to $10 billion revenue a year baneth. Today Genentech is bigger than Bristol Myers Squib on virtually every measure of company evaluation is the leading cancer medicine company in the United States if not the world. And it's interesting to see how the technology drove industry structure transformation. And we'll see that again. So Michael, when you started, did you have the goal in mind? Did you imagine I'm going to start this company? I want to build it to a certain size and then sell it to a large company. Or do you have a different path? Was it surprising to you? Well, the expectation was is that we would build it to a large and during enterprise, the kind of stuff that Jim Collins has talked about. This was before Jim Collins was talking that way. And we didn't know. We presumed we would take it public or perhaps it would find itself being merged into another organization. But it wasn't clear at the time how it would happen. We knew why it would happen. And the why it would happen was the value proposition in which the company was based, namely that there was a technology shift that was transforming the distribution system for these sorts of medicines, changing some of the delivery system requirements. And as a consequence, there was going to be as a result of those macro shifts. And opportunity for a company to establish itself was the premier service based member in that value chain, which we did succeed in doing. But it was hardly a straight line path to get there. So I'm curious. I just want to drill that on this a little bit more. Then you got to the point where you sold the company. Did they come to you or did you go to them? Or was it more of a meeting in a smoke field room and saying, hey, this sounds like an interesting partnership? It's a great question. We had an ongoing business relationship with Bristol Myers because they were a very, very important part of the product mix that we sold. So we had become a very, very large customer. In fact, I think they're single largest customer. And something happens as those of you who have studied microeconomics now, in terms of trade change, there's a statement they have in the banking industry. If you loan somebody a million dollars, the bank owns you. If the bank loans you, a billion dollars, you own the bank. And so in fact, what had happened is we became such an important customer to Bristol Myers that we had market power that they were not thrilled about having to deal with. And that evolved our relationship into first the strategic joint venture. And ultimately, they decided to buy the company. Very, very interesting. I think that's very instructive for everybody. So let me ask you, would you do it again? Knowing what you know now? I mean, I know that every person I know who starts a company says that it was filled with surprises they never been imagined. So knowing what you know now, would you have done it then? Yes, I would do it again because it was the time of my life that I had the personal flexibility. I wasn't yet married, didn't have kids. I could work like a maniac, 800 hours a week, had the energy to do that. And I had no sense that it might go on for days and days and weeks and weeks and years and years. And it does. So even though we got to the point of several hundred million revenues and that business center, Bristol Myers-Widd, did I think three billion revenues last year, the process of pushing the boulder up the hill and not knowing or being able to see where that boulder is going to crest. But knowing if you stop pushing, the boulder will win. It was something I don't relish doing anymore. And I'm happy to help other people who want to push the boulder up and share with them the experiences and toils along the way and give my best estimate of where it does begin to plateau and where they will essentially across the castle. So units interesting, a lot of people who have been very successful say that there are many, many dark days during the process and maybe that's compared to you are pushing the boulder up the hill and not quite knowing if you're going to be able to hold it back. Would you describe it that way too? Is days where you don't quite know where you're going and your flashlight isn't quite bright enough to see around the next corner? Oh yes. Yeah. Oh, there are a lot of dark days. Many more dark days than sunny days along the way. But what motivates you at that point? I mean, what is it that keeps you going when the day is dark, is it just the amount of momentum you've already put into it? Is it the end you see? Is it the fact that you're helping people? What is it that's the motivator? I think it's a little bit of all of those. I guess some of it's got to be a little psychographic. It's got to be a little fear of failure. It's got to be a recognition that you've got responsibility for employees and families. You've got responsibility to people that you've accepted, investment funds from. I don't know any entrepreneur that's gone out and raised money with a plan that wasn't aggressive. And then what happens is once you've raised the money, all of a sudden there's this realization it's not a projection anymore. It's a projection that has to become a reality. Otherwise, things get very uncomfortable. You got to deliver. Now, guess what? Now on the other side of the table, you are now giving out money and expecting people to stick with the plans that they've put together. You obviously now have your finger in lots of different pots with lots of new ventures. Maybe you could tell us a little bit about some of them that you are most excited about. Well, I think the major thesis of our life science investing at MDV is really to focus on the convergence of life sciences with information technology and material sciences. So the future, as we see it, we're kind of bio-ax for venture capital. And if a project doesn't have enough elements of this multidisciplinary mix, if it isn't really kind of pushing the edge of where those disciplines might meet and be integrated, it's really not of great interest to us. So it may be a great project for many other people. So just to give you an example, one of the companies that we're working on is called Pacific Bio-Sciences. And Pacific Bio-Sciences is a group of physicists who were specialists in optical technology, who have married that with the ability to analyze the synthesis and sequencing of DNA at the single molecule level at a cost which is orders of magnitude lower than what the cost of current DNA sequencing are. So in fact, the company has just recently been awarded by the National Cancer Institute a multi-million dollar grant for the so-called thousand dollar genome project. So the first time we sequence the human genome, and we only have two human sequences, one of Craig mentors and the other person who is anonymous. But over the course of the next 10 to 15 years, we expect as a matter of course, in clinical medicine for each of us to have our genome's sequence. But that's not going to happen with the current technology and with the current costs per sequence. So one of the areas that we're very excited about is the impact that this enabling technology will have on transforming the US healthcare system because once we have the information on each of our genetic profiles, it gives us tremendous insight into preventive medicine which is the best way to manage the healthcare system that we've got today in a cost-effective manner. So I would assume this is really important piece of personalized medicine. Yeah, exactly. So personalized medicine, the so-called ability to use genetics and genomics to identify the right drug to give to a specific patient at the right time in the course of their illness or recovery, is an area that is very dependent on doing genetic analysis at the level of the individual. So we're going to hold genomic analysis, but being able to analyze specific genes in a tumor tissue for instance or specific proteins in blood to make determinations about the progress of an individual's cancer, the progress or likelihood of their potential diabetes or osteoporosis or cardiovascular disease. And we're investing in several companies that are pioneering that field, this field so-called molecular diagnostics which genomic health is perhaps the premier company and today with respect to cancer and tissue analysis for cancer care. Cool. So one of the interesting things, one of the most interesting things that you get to do as a venture capitalist is set on boards of all of these different companies. I'm sure that gives you a tremendous perspective, but it's one of the places that we often don't get a look at. Maybe you could give us a little bit of a sense of the flavor, what happens in boardrooms, what are the roles of different types of boards and maybe a little bit about the diversity of what happens in these different types of companies. Sure. So, the four profit boards are very different than non-ferr-profit boards and I'll address that first and if we have time or interest we can address non-ferr-profit boards. But four profit boards for small seed stage startup companies or the board is in essence just a extension of the management team. So the selection of board members ought to be based on people who can really add value and not just add capital to what you're trying to accomplish. So I'm on some boards where it's the founders and me or maybe the founders and me and somebody with a complimentary skill set to mind who's an independent director or representing another venture partner in the financing. And we tend to meet on a monthly basis with a lot of interaction in between meetings. As a company grows the board tends to grow in terms of size. It tends to shift its composition from being composed of founders and investors to being increasingly founders, investors and then people with very relevant industry expertise who can help guide and support the management team as they move through later stages of commercialization and market entry. And the frequency of those meetings tends to be maybe semi or bi-monthly sometimes even quarterly. And then ultimately by the time you get to a public company board it tends to be quarterly meetings. There tends to be a lot of more ministerial board work. And by ministerial I mean the work of board committees in very formal regulatory prescribed ways like an audit committee that has to comply with Sarbanes Oxley rules or a compensation committee that needs to be sure that it's policies for the compensation of the CEO and the management team are consistent with the fairness expectations of the institutional investor community. So very, very different the early stage board service is roll up your sleeves. It's almost like being an entrepreneur yourself. And as we grow companies we tend to get more dressed up when we go to the board meetings and sometimes even wear ties. It is and do you often find that there's a lot of tension between the management team and the board members in terms of the direction of the company and you know if you end up with that sort of arm wrestling situation who wins? Short term no one wins. Long term the investor generally wins. But the what we try to avoid in our own situations is getting involved with entrepreneurs or founders who aren't pragmatic, who don't understand or have common goals and objectives about what we're trying to do when we're constructing a company. There's an art to constructing a company and probably the first principle of that art is that the founders before they even get in front of us have common objectives and goals with respect to what the company is supposed to be and the tone in which it's supposed to conduct itself and getting there. And then that we as investing partners share that. If that's the case then we can always generally like in a good marriage or relationship kind of work things out when there are differences. But if people don't start out with a common set of those principles it's very easy for that to get off track and it's hurtful to everybody involved. You waste a lot of time because the real competition isn't across the board table. The real competition is either in the market or under development someplace where you can't even detect it. And so time is our real enemy. It can be our friend but in general it's our enemy and it's a really a race against time which is why it's so anxious and difficult to be an entrepreneur and a young company a team member. Super. So let me switch gears for a second. You have done so many different things and one of them that I think is actually one of the most exciting things you've done over the last couple of years is being the co-chair of the Yes On Proposition 71 ballot initiative trying to get funding large scale funding for stem cell research in California. How did you get involved with this and maybe you could tell us a little bit about what skills you brought. So why did it and what skills you brought to this political campaign? When I started my career in the biotechnology industry the disruptive technology was Recomment in DNA and at that time Recomment in DNA had not been around long enough to have any social benefit which meant that for technology ludites who were skeptical of the technology itself that there was tremendous opportunity for them to raise skeptical concerns about misuse of the technology about societal harm and as a consequence there were places like Berkeley California already nuclear free zones that became recombinant free zones and there was a whole public policy conversation that had to go on to get people comfortable with the fact that the critics were largely making unsound scientific arguments and the reality is the critics don't really go away until you start to cure people with the technology. Today we have 350 million people on the planet who've been treated with Recomment in DNA based or monoclonal antibody based medicines and you don't hear any concern about Recomment in DNA technology we've dealt with very well. Well here comes beginning in about 2001 human embryonic stem cells and the tenor of concern about those technologies human embryonic stem cells sounded just like Recomment in DNA debate and the federal government under the current administration decided to be extremely restrictive in their funding of this and really in an unprecedented way shut down the national institutes of health from continuing to fund anything but a very small trickle of the field. As a consequence a group of patient advocates in California and around the nation a group of leading members of the Stanford medical faculty, Irving Weissman among them, Phil Pisa the dean of the medical school, Paul Berg, a famous Nobel Prize winner for his work on developing Recomment in DNA, teamed together and decided that there was an opportunity to do something specific at the state level in California and to step into the federal funding void and that's what led to the formation of the campaign for Prop 71. That campaign was led by a former Stanford undergraduate law school graduate by the name of Robert Klein who was the father of a son with juvenile diabetes, the son of a mother with Alzheimer's disease and he was outraged that the federal government was being so restrictive in the funding. He was the architect of an affordable housing act in California after he had come out of the law school in the 1970s and had the insight that one could use the bond financing mechanism in California through the initiative process to raise an independent pool of money for research funding within the state and that's what the Prop 71 campaign was all about. Over 5 million California voters and an unprecedented act of people's democracy voted in favor of Prop 71 and I'm very proud to have been associated with it and feel very fortunate to have then been appointed to the governing board which is administering the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine which is the funding body in the form of a state agency to drive stem cell research in California along with Dean Pizzo here, Dean Kessler at the medical school at UCSF, Chancellor Bergenau at UC Berkeley and a number of other leading physician scientists and patient advocates who are dedicated to making California the leading community for stem cell research, responsible stem cell research in the world. Well I know that when we were talking in advance of this interview you were telling me about how you played a role in fundraising to help you on this initiative and I thought some of the strategies that you used and the arguments you used to get people to buy into it were extremely provocative and also very instrumental and leveraged your knowledge of entrepreneurship. Maybe you could share some of that. So I had never been involved in a political campaign I tend to be somewhat moderate in my political views sometimes for Republican candidates, sometimes for Democratic candidate. So my motivation to be involved with Prop 71 as was everyone who was involved in the leadership of the campaign had to do with the rightness of the cause as we felt it. And one of the contributions that I was able to make was to think about kind of what the economic argument to donors would be. To run an initiative campaign in California given the size of the state, multi-medium markets could cost at minimum $20 million and perhaps more. People have spent up to $100 million. Our budget estimates were that it would cost somewhere between 20 and 30 million to raise public awareness to the point that we could get a yes on 71 vote. In that connection the argument I constructed was relatively straightforward and that was if it's going to take $30 million to generate $3 billion of research spending in essence that's a 100 to 1 leverage on your philanthropic contribution. So that was in fact the argument that we took to wealthy, biomedical, legally inclined donors and to patient advocates so we had no industry support by design in raising the nearly $30 million which we raised in less than nine months to get this done. And people recognized that 100 to 1 leverage was something that you couldn't get by giving a dollar to the other worthy cause that you might otherwise give it to. So I think that helped. Super. So since it passed with a great mandate how are things going? Are you still engaged, involved in following the progress? Yeah, so I'm very involved and I've been active in a number of committees. The Intellectual Property Committee, Legislative Affairs Committee was active in the Presidential Search Committee which has since been disbanded because we have an absolutely magnificent president of the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine now in place a former head of one of the NIH branches and a former Associate Dean at UCSF. Well, we've put all the infrastructure in place. While we've selected San Francisco as our headquarters for this effort through a process that yielded $18 million in subsidies from the city of San Francisco. Never in the history of the state agents in California has the state agency been the recipient of subsidies to locate somewhere and we had a great bake off between San Diego, Sacramento, and San Francisco in that regard that was all done in a very, very public process. But today we are unable to fund the initial grants that we have. Stanford is one of the recipients of those grants because of litigation from some of our opponents who have gotten this tied up in the state court system on the basis of some very narrow constitutional law arguments which are in the process of being litigated. So there's a trial on February 27 as a matter of fact which should hopefully provide some light on when we might be able to make funding available. So it's an interesting thing where the will of the people was to fund this and to get the research going and to begin to move curious to patients. And the reality is that if you want to be obstructionist and disruptive, one can be. I'm sure this is quite an education for you along the way. So speaking of education, if we look around this room it's filled with students from all different technology disciplines who are looking ahead to entrepreneurial careers of their own. Are there things that you had wished that you had learned when you were there age, that you would wish you had learned when you were in school that would have made your path easier? Well the obvious questions, yeah. I wish I knew everything I know now 25 years ago. Perhaps maybe not something. Do you think you could put it in this one hour? Yes. But probably the most tangible thing that I think is perhaps part of the curriculum now that wasn't a part of the curriculum when I came through was issues related to intellectual property. Patents, trademarks, copyrights, all of those things are essentially important to many of the industries that you guys may have interest in that I've been a participant or investor in. And those all had to be self taught. So understanding more about the role of intellectual property, the role of patents, what's a good patent, what's relevant about a patent, what's important about maintaining trademark protection in your young emerging enterprise, how to secure and properly police, copyright benefits for yourselves and your companies with all things that I had to learn in the school of hard docs along with. And many other things, but that was something that I could have been taught in this setting. Was there any specific situation that happened early on where you thought, gosh, if only I had known this, some specific story about missed opportunity? Well, actually the best story was once I got educated. But I think it was very difficult and the first time I had to deal with intellectual property licenses from university technology offices and didn't really understand what the elements of a patent are. And for those of you who have either written patents or certainly read patents, you understand there's kind of a unique language and structure to how patents are drafted, how claims are written. You know, it's, it's as unnatural to me as reading a Plato or Kant might be to some of you. And it would have been nice to have some helping going through that. Probably the most opportunistic situation we had is that Axion once had a prior name as a company. It was called Access BioTechnology. And we had a logo. And the use of the logo next to the name comprised a copy mark, a copyright and a trademark, I guess it was. And we discovered another company that was using a similar name and a similar trademark and we sent them a cease and desist letter and never heard back. And then we heard that they were in registration for their IPO. So we sent yet another cease and desist letter. At this point, we also sent it to their outside council who we could identify through the SEC filings. All of a sudden they got very interested in talking to us because in the course of an SEC filing for a young company, you have to disclose pending litigation. So this company, because they hadn't done a thorough job of searching trademarks and of paying attention to prior correspondence, put themselves in an extremely vulnerable position with respect to us at a time when they didn't really want to have to be dealing with any sort of housekeeping problems or issues. And it was an unfortunate situation for them that they trespassed our marks, but we resolved it very happily. And it was one of the more interesting transactions that I've been involved in because we essentially resolved the problem by selling them our name and our trademark. Are you changing your name? Change your name? Yeah, yeah. Great. So last question I'm going to ask and then I'm going to open it up to the room is what, and this is a very generic question, but I always like to ask this to everyone of our guests, what career advice would you give to someone who is just finishing school now? We talked about what you wished you learned in school, but as you dive off that diving board into this very big world of opportunity, what advice would you give? I would say follow your passions. As Tina has said to you, entrepreneurship is an extreme sport and it takes tremendous amount of persistence and tenacity. There's a lot of failure. There's a lot of self-doubt along the way. If you're not pursuing something you're passionate about, it's going to be very easy to stop along the way. And being a successful entrepreneur means you don't stop. You don't stop at anything. You just get there. You may change course multiple times, but you get there. So if you're passionate about what you're doing, that's an easy thing to do. If you're not passionate about it, it's painfully difficult. It's the second piece of career advice would be to think about, as my partner Bill David out has said, think about standing in the path of progress. Think about identifying areas that are going to be important to society and to the planet for the next 25 to 50 years. And those are the areas that if I were charting my career today, I'd be thinking about areas like energy and materials and areas like life sciences, but the internet is going to have a run for quite some time. I just think it's a magnificent time to be at a great research university like Stanford and to have access to the cross departmental and cross school programs that you have here. Super. Sort of like find a big way then stand in front of it, so they catch those waves. So let me open it up for questions. Who wants to go first? Great. Oh, please pick up the microphone and speak into it. There should be one right on the back of the seat in front of you. Or perfect, and push the little button. Thanks. So I think the way we think about it in the context of the companies we're involved in, there's a health economic argument that's the basis for reimbursement. And it gets to the core question about pricing. How do you know what to price? Do you price on what the cost to manufacture? The drug is how do you deal with trying to factor in the cost of the 99 other projects that didn't make it that this one's got to support? So there's this cross subsidization. And I don't want to speak to the specific product that you mentioned, and we don't really focus on developing therapeutic products like that. But I can tell you in other areas of healthcare where we are involved in developing products, we're focused on having a pretty profound economic benefit to the system. So for instance, in the case of genomic health, archetype DX, assay, it's a $3,000 test, but it's to help save somebody from going through $22,000 of treatment that they now with the benefit of that test don't really need. So we're interested in projects that can help save the healthcare system money while they're also contributing to what patient benefit. I think that's the responsibility that I know we feel we have at MDP. Great. Back in the back? What are your thoughts on open source biology? Why don't you repeat the question? The question was, what are my thoughts on open source biology? It means lots of different things to different people. So why don't you define the context in which you've asked the question? I would especially like in regards to DNA and homing, right, and path to human DNA and et cetera. So open source biology as defined as should genes be patented? Yeah. I think it's okay that genes are patented if we didn't have... Can you get out of this? I did provide whatever guidance he wanted. I was deeply indebted to him for that. Unfortunately, he couldn't take me into any of his open booktests. And I just shared my experience with him somewhat. Great. We've got a couple questions. One and the two. Just a little bit of a great question. How did you go about learning and training words and conures? You know, I think there's a theme that goes through a couple of things that we've touched on today, which is being able to identify subject matter experts and to interact with them in a fashion that they're willing to share information with you. You've obviously got to be able to make some contribution to what they know or what they would like to know. And so I've been able to do that in a wide variety of fields, whether it's in biology or chemistry or biochemistry or chemical engineering most recently. And that was the same as my career. We were on the... There was a company I was involved in called C-discorporation. It was on the leading edge of what was going on in these areas. And so we had some of the best patent and intellectual property mines in the country working for us internally. And they were very, very patient and kind to help me better understand the issues I had as I had them. Basically, what you're saying is you have to know what you don't know and then build a team around you that are... People are going to help you out. And it's all about leverage. So great. I know we have a question back there. You mentioned earlier that Solv founder had a team of parts out in the field of technical growth in nature and exploration. What did you do today in those drop-backs and what were you doing for the company? Should I repeat the question? Yeah. So the question was, as a Solv founder, it's sometimes very difficult. What did I do to mitigate those issues? Well, once I was able to get enough critical mass to construct a great management team, I think that really addressed it, but that was probably two years into it. So it was a very difficult time to get to that point. The first major hire, a real credibility enhancing hire for Axion, had accepted the position, was supposed to talk to his employer who was a major East Coast academic institution. He was going to fly to the West Coast and join me in this project. And I remember it being odd being three hours later that I hadn't heard from him after he had supposedly gone into Resign at lunchtime that day. And so I called him and he was so sheepish on the phone. He'd never been sheepish before. He decided not to resign from his current position. So he was, in essence, telling me he wasn't going to come. So that, to me, was devastating. He talked about dark days. This was something I'd worked on for three months, something that I'd been continually talking to my board and investor about, and then he dropped out. And it was really devastating.
