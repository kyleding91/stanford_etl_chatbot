 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Today's guest is really special to us. We have a guest who's flown all the way in from Italy to give this talk. Ferdinando Basima is a magician, but he also is trained as a mechanical engineer. And in fact, he spends his time now as a consultant helping companies create magical experiences for their customers. He works for companies such as Ferrari and Nike and Microsoft, coming up with ways for them to really create awe-spying experiences for their customers. So without further ado, Fernando. Thank you. Thank you for inviting me. My name is Ferdinando. And as Tina said, I am a magic experience designer, which means that I design magical experiences, waving my two professional backgrounds as a mechanical engineer and as a performing magician or conjurer. And so what is a magic experience? In my mind, a magical experience is an experience where I basically design context and spaces, where people can experience something surprising, something unusual, something magical, something that brings you into out of your normal context. And hopefully you are going to catch a new slice of reality that will not under your radar in the first place, which is hopefully what is going to happen in the next 45 minutes or so. So the title of today's talk is the magician leadership. And basically, what it means to think and act like a magician. So we are trying to address the issue, the idea of leadership and how it's been evolving in the last few years. And hopefully it will be an entertaining experience for you. So let's start with the Twitter version of this talk. So if any of you should go away before the end of it, this is the compact version of what we are going to talk about. A magician leader is someone who is able to navigate a reality in an artful way, open to possibilities, keeping his mind open to what is going to happen for the benefit of the whole. So this is the concept we are going to elaborate upon. Now the basic assumption is that let's start with an image. First of all, let's address the elephant in the room. Why would we use the word magic or the word magician? If you bear with me until the end of it, the language of magic, it's a very rich language that allow you to conceive and to manifest magical things. So basically, it's a language that will allow you to tap into an ordinary slice of reality. Now if we chart like you see the spectrum of the electromagnetic field, basically what you can hear and what you see, it's a very tiny slice of the full spectrum. So in another word, our ordinary experience, so what we see and what we hear, it's a very tiny slice of what exists. Which we generally are not able to access. So put it in a different way. This image is another way of tapping into the idea that there is a huge share of reality which we do not know and we are not even aware of it. And talking about magic is a way of accessing the rest of the unexplored possibilities. So talking about the language of magic is another way of going outside our comfort zone just because magic is exactly where it's going to happen outside our comfort zone. Now we know that our model of reality is made up of many pieces that are useful for us to navigate reality. But at the same time, we use many assumptions, many of which are useful, but many of other are supposed to be called into question to go beyond them. So let me share with you this piece of video created by an English psychology professor called Richard Weisman with also a magician and most of his work lies at the boundary of perception, psychology and magic. So take a look at this. This is what we mean when we talk about assumptions. Well, this is a playful and fun and visual way to remind ourselves that this is also besides this three-dimensional illusion, our perception of reality is made up of many assumptions and we are here to try to question some of them. Now put it in another way to use a quote by the English visionary poet William Blake. May God ask keep from single vision and Newton's leap. So according to Blake, Blake was particularly angry with the Newton's discoveries on optics because he thought that Newton somehow reduced vision to its only to its mechanical and physiological aspects while Blake thought that vision is something broader. And we are here to see how we can see beyond and to see beyond is not doesn't happen through our own eyes. So one of the most, we are going to reveal you a few secrets of magic, which I consider such. And in order to discover some of these secrets that will allow us to see beyond and then find some sort of connections with the idea of leadership, one of the most powerful tools to see beyond our normal reality is the arts. So the power of the arts, especially in the last few years, it's becoming mainstream as an important tool to nurture leadership. So the idea, the aesthetic experience is considered an important ingredient, not just a nice to have, but an important ingredient to complete your whatever leadership means to lead yourself and others in ways that are new compared to the past. So we know that in the past years leadership meant something quite pretty straightforward. The leader gave directions or orders or instructions and someone else executed them. Nowadays to be a leader means something more complex and to be in tune with the timings that we are living in, we are addressing the issue of leadership in new ways. So the idea of the power of the arts is definitely a very important ingredient. That's because Oscar Wilde said that what we see and how we see it depends on the arts that have influenced us. So it's historically a training in the liberal arts has been considered a fundamental ingredient to see reality and to expand your perception of it in ways that are totally magical. I recently came across an interesting paper from the American Journal of Medicine. And basically the title of this is The Use of Fine Arts to Enhance Visual Diagnostic Skills. So this is just one of the many papers that address the fact that exposing yourself to arts in whatever format will allow you to become more sensitive to the complexities of reality and transcend the more superficial aspects of it. So according to this study the medicine students who have been exposed to arts in a very specific way increased by 25% their diagnostic skills. So this is one of the few quantitative studies that pointed towards how very practically been exposed to arts will enhance your reading of the world and in this case how you can interpret a patient situation. Now the fact that the arts can have an impact on how we see reality and how we can incorporate arts in our professional life. In this case I just want to quote steam jobs and this is basically, by the way this is the cover of the economist, the first cover of the economist since steam jobs died and they titled Demagician of course as a tribute of course it's very well known the impact that steam jobs had on our culture on his whole. Now let me just quote this piece straight from his words. He comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best things that humans have done and then try to bring those things in to what you're doing. I mean Picasso had a saying he said good arts copy, great art steal and we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas and I think part of what made the Macintosh grade was that the people working on it were musicians and poets and artists and zoologists and historians who also happen to be the best computer scientist in the world. Now it's already known fact that this separation between art and science is something wrong. Basically there is not it's not two opposites and I found it beautifully captured the essence of this idea in the words of Buckminster Fuller who said that when I'm working on a problem I never think about beauty but when I've finished if the solution is not beautiful I know it is wrong. So this is another way of trying to address the fact that exposing yourself to art and beauty in whatever format it's a very key ingredient to bring the concept of leadership, personal leadership and towards other to its next level. Now this is the moment of the trivia of the day. Did you know that at some point around the 16th century some of my European ancestors thought that California was a matter of fact an island. I found this piece of information quite interesting and by the way this has been a long held misconception that went viral, well whatever viral meant at that time. And people stick to it. Now I found maps pretty fascinating tools. Maps are fascinating tools to make sense out of external reality and to navigate into reality. Well nowadays all the maps that we have to chart external reality are quite accurate. As a matter of fact very few reality, very few maps to make sense of our evolving social and cultural background are meaningful. So it's always more and more difficult to draw maps to make sense out of a very complex evolving landscape. Now as someone say we live in a WUKA world. Have you heard the word WUKA? It's taken from the military jargon and now drawn into the corporate world. WUKA means a world which is volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. So basically all our certainties are kind of evaporated. And in order to survive and to thrive in such an environment we don't need a more complex model. We don't need a more refined and more sophisticated map. What is useful to survive into this kind of environment is a concept called the negative capability. Now the idea of a negative capability is a creation of the English poet John Kitz. According to John Kitz, negative capability is the ability to live into uncertainties, to live into mystery, to process and to conceive opposite ideas and nonetheless be able to function. So negative capabilities, the ability that can be trained to stand in a moment of uncertainty where you don't know, you don't have any much certain reference points and nonetheless be enabled to stand into it and be able to function. Now this is another interesting study. Well in the field of management literary, there are multiplicity of studies addressing the fact that nowadays a good manager and a good leader is someone who is able just to stand into a situation without much certainties and be open and be able to navigate into this waters in a comfortable way. So the idea of being standing open to what's happening, to what's going to happen, like listening to subtle signals, the weak signals that are emerging and basically the role of a manager and the leader is to facilitate the emergence of things that want to emerge. But again, the idea of standing in the midst of chaos, standing in the midst of complexity and nonetheless being able to function and also being able to go with the flow as they say and being able to surrender to events because good things can happen. So it's a kind of post-modern kind of faith. Just stay there, just be quiet, don't hurry up and don't speed up decisions. Just let's wait and see what happens. Now I plan to give you a small peel of negative capability just to train you, just to give you a stimulation of how to endure this idea of negative capability. I'm going to show you a very quick video which is going to blur the lines of what you think is real and is going to blur the lines of your reference point or your frame of reference and the game is to be able to just experience it without trying to pin point it, to pin it down to some sort of explanation and to understanding and just be with it. So let's see what happens. So again one of the side effects and byproducts of exposing yourself to arts in general, it's an enhanced ability to be in this negative capability state. So again we fall back to the idea that exposing yourself to arts is a good cure to bring our leadership understanding to its next level. So in the third secret I want to reveal you has to do with the concept of narratives. The idea of the narrative creates reality and with this we mean that the way we how we use our words and our language has a very specific impact and the fact on how we perceive reality. So we perceive reality mediating it through our own language and how we map experience and how we process them as a very specific psychological impact on us. So basically how we decide to say things they have a very specific inner outcome. And this is a known fact to people, I mean to linguists, linguists who, according to the kind of metaphors and language structures that we use, we shape our understanding of reality. And this is of course it has to do with the idea of leadership itself and calling it it magician leadership instead of for example warrior leadership, which is the typical narrative web narrative domain that it is typically associated with the metaphor of leadership of the last decades. Typically in the 19th and 20th century that were specifically characterized by control, by certainties, by predictability. Typical metaphors had a warrior like and control like, command and control like flavor. Shifting towards complexity we are witnessing a shift towards a more organic set of metaphors and the idea of magic itself is a way of addressing the unknown and mysterious aspects of reality which are not under our immediate control. Now a very nice quote that came up with is that the universe is made of stories, not of atoms. And according to this American poet the way how we tell our self stories is another way of addressing the fact. The stories take shape in our reality. And we of course we have our own personal narrative and also there are collective narratives. Narratives also shape a corporate culture or a nation culture and we have also global narratives. So there are multiplicity of levels of narratives. Talking about leadership a very interesting way of reframing the idea of leadership nowadays is through this piece of writing. Leadership in the 21st century is like dancing on a slippery floor. If you try to stay in control your energy will be focused on not falling. But if you relax and use the walks on the floor to facilitate your dance moves it will be a lot more fun and effective. So this is another way this is a very interesting I found this metaphor very interesting to address the idea of leadership to go beyond the mere command and control attitude. So just go with the flow and hopefully have fun with it. Now how can we start to explore our own personal narrative? There is a very and also to explore to be aware that narratives can be designed, can be modified, can be woven. They are basically made up but according to how you make them up different meanings emerge, different slices of reality emerge. Now you can play a very simple game which is a very simple question and the question being why you do what you do. This is a meme which started as an art project at the art festival called Burning Man and starting with this very simple line and there's of course a website that you can check. Basically the question is try to come up with some sort of narrative, some sort of explanation, some sort of language description of why you do what you do. As simple as this question may seem the replies that you can come up with can reach quite an interesting level of complexity and basically the art project was focused on the fact that you can come up with something quick and nice and short and the art project was keep your photo with your sign and basically the website is a collection of people explaining the world, telling the world why they do what they do and sometimes when people ask myself this is a piece of my personal narrative, why people ask how can a mechanical engineer shift gears and become a magician. As an matter of fact it's not a radical change because how I see it and this is of course is my personal way of describing it. I've always been fascinated with mechanism, I've always been curious how things work, be it a watch or an engine or a magic trick or a psychological mechanism. So the pattern that connects is to understand and come up with how things work and that's how makes sense to me to describe what I'm doing even nowadays. So the idea of addressing and exploring your personal narrative it's a way of making yourself conscious of how narrative works and how we can conjure up with them to make them as meaningful as possible for ourselves. And a last secret that I wanted to share with you, as a matter of fact secrets are something that can be revealed but some other secrets are meant to be discovered and for this reason my last secret is an invitation to you to figure out by yourself and how you can figure out by yourself basically doing two things. One is download this presentation from my website which is www.ferdinando.biz slash etl.ppt and the moment you'll review this presentation with a keen eye there is something there is a secret to be discovered inside of it. So just to keep the feeling of exploration going and the second thing that you can do is a resort to one of my favorite magic tools ever and I'm talking about books. Books are a very ancient and powerful way to access hidden dimensions and ordinary dimensions and this is at least of 10 books that you can hopefully you can explore and each one of them explores different nuances of what speaking the language of magic means and entails. Most of them of course has a they have an entrepreneurial and business-like orientation but as you I hope you get so far most of the ideas we are talking so far are related to your revolution as human beings in the general sense and so exploring the language of magic is a way of working to a higher frequency. So finally how can we know if we are working on the magician path? How can we know if we are working on the path of being a magician leader? Well one thing that you can keep your eye on to understand if you are doing your magician leader job properly is to keep your eye on what it's called synchronicity. So synchronicity is a fancy word that comes from the work of one of the founding fathers of psychoanalysis, Carly Jung and in Jung's description a synchronicity it's an event it's a meaningful coincidence when for example like you're thinking about someone and then you meet this person in the street or you think about someone and the telephone rings and you meet this person. So it's like a synchronicity it's an event that basically shows a sort of connection between what you're thinking, your inner workings and the external world. As a matter of fact as a student of engineering you are totally in tune with that kind of magic that we call technology and in the last say for 100 years our culture favored this kind of magic that we call technology which is something outside ourselves. As a matter of fact the tools of magic that we've been addressing so far it's the kind of inner technology that can guide yourself to behave and to think and to act like a magician. So talking about synchronicity, synchronicity also shows some sort of connection between past present and future. In the words of Albert Einstein people like us who believe in physics know that the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion. And so in order to address this idea of what a synchronicity is I would like to play to do an experiment which is a way of showing you a connection between past, present and future and from a connection within inner thinking and external world events. So I'm going to show you what the physicist David Baum called the unbroken wholeness of the implicate order. So basically this is what is going to happen. This is the deal. Before coming here I asked Tina I sent an envelope to Tina and asking her to bring this envelope today with her. Tina will you just confirm this is what is what I'm saying is true. Okay so you have this envelope with you which you received sometime in the past and you kept it sealed so far with the promise of bringing it with you today. Is that correct? Yes. So Tina's envelope is holding a thought from the past. Now today let's fast forward to today. I asked Lithicia. Okay now please just confirm that what I'm saying is true. I ask you just to make a blank space a blank space in your mind to think about a playing card and seal the thought of discarding to your mind. You had the free choice. Please tell out loud if what I'm saying is correct. Yes it is correct. And we didn't agree not only what we just said right? So you're holding a thought of a playing card freely chosen in your mind. Is that correct? So this is you're holding in your mind the present a thought from the present. And in a moment can it ask your help? Will you come here for a minute? Thank you. And your name is Akash. Thank you for helping. Akash stand here thank you. What is going to happen in a moment? You are going to act an action which is going to happen in the next immediate future. Is that okay? Akash here we have a pack of playing cards. Okay now do me if I were just touch any card. Do not show to anyone just pull it close to your chest. Let's not anyone see it just keep it here for a moment. Fair? Yep. Now this is the three events we've been working on. A thought from the past, a thought from the present and then action from the future which is now manifested. Fair? Sounds good. Now Lithicia will you for the first time just name out loud which is the card you're thinking of? The Four of Diamonds. The Four of Diamonds. Tina will you please open up for the first time the envelope that you've been keeping and show to everyone. It's the Four of Diamonds. Akash will you show everyone the card you just picked? It's the Four of Diamonds. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks a lot. And this is the moment. Any questions? Thank you. Please. Are you allowed to reveal the secret? As a matter of fact there is no secret. This is just what happened and if you navigate and you are sensitive to what happens you just go with the flow. I deeply believe that magical things happen. Please. The card's not finished saying could you have a different ending? This is a good question. But as we had a weird start I had a very deep faith that the final ending was going to work. And of course there's always an element of yes as in life we live in a wooka world which is volatile, uncertain, complex and so yeah you have to navigate into it. Is it a coincidence that everyone that was just picked for the example is associated with the administration of this class in some way? No but this is a good question and just before coming here there is a saying that big great minds think alike. And letitia which I asked for help just before starting here she had the same thought right. I only asked people to partake just to make sure that they are not uncomfortable in front of an audience. In any case as a famous magician from the fifties said and these men was a mentalist. The people who play with their mind make reading the future makes things like this happen. This gentleman said that for those who believe no explanation is necessary. For those who do not believe no explanation will suffice. It means that in the audience there will always be the person who think this is pre-arranged which is not and in the audience will be the people who believe this is just happening. And asking their help especially Tina's help, letitia's help and Akash help it's also a way of validating the fact that they are not lending themselves to an experiment just to make me look cool and besides I am a magician okay thank you. Yes. So you create magical experiences for customers like Nike or Ferrari. What types of things do you do for them? So let's touch upon a couple of different subjects. One of the topics that I deal with is the topic of innovation and when by innovation we mean the creation, the creation something which is new, even remixing pieces of existing things and that brings into a merge on things that something for some reason are new. And the narrative and the language of magic lends itself quite beautifully to discover new territories which you didn't even envision that existed. So we are in the real mode instead of problem solving we are in the real mode problem setting. And again the idea of conceiving something that you do not even know that exist, it's typically speaking the domain of magic. So this is one piece of the puzzle. Another piece of the puzzle when we come to customer relationship management in the last few years the concept of experience design kind of took shape. So how we can juggle, how we can mix with the ingredients in order to facilitate a specific experience to emerge. And this applies whatever kind of business that has a customer base. Nowadays many companies are somehow steering towards exploring the idea of how can we make a more engaging and more deep and meaningful experience for our customers. So in that case my intervention is to stimulate the thought on how to create magical experiences which are something that transcend the normal ordinary and mundane. And it's the creation of a customer experience that whose goal is to delight the customer. We kind of take nowadays we take for granted the idea of customer satisfaction and any company that wants to thrive and survive profitably. It's better to devote some energies to the creation of an experience which is engaging immersive, pleasant, meaningful and hopefully delightful. Yes. How do you quantify that? This need to do that for your clients in some ways. Can you repeat the question please? Okay, yes. How can I quantify? How can you quantify? The experiences that you create and that success for your clients clients. Yes. So the issue of how you quantify an experience is of course it's an open question. First of all if we bind to the narrative of negative capability for example there is a huge slice of reality which cannot be measured. So let's assume even how can we measure if a painting is more it's more worth than another painting or a sculpture. How can we compare a sculpture to a painting or a dish of spaghetti, right? It's a very difficult thing to compare. But nonetheless the idea of addressing how you can measure this. I would say a happy customer, happy client, a coming back customer that refers you to other customers through words of mouth. It's a pretty good indicator that you're doing a good job. Like when people after a show like when they applaud it means that they're you're doing a good job. Like if you're a stand-up comedian and you get a laugh it means you're doing a good job. Even if you're not strictly speaking able to measure it in a quantitative way. How do you bring magic to industries and problems where by definition success involves no surprises? I don't. Well maybe we have to reframe the concept of surprise. Can you adjust articulate a little bit more what you mean? There's many fields that require a very stable type of environment, lawyers required no surprise things sometimes engineers to yet how you bring leadership that comes with the magic that you talk about into these environments. Well probably some business or some fields can be more the language of magic can be more coherent if we are talking about products or services and with this I agree with you. Some places maybe are more organically ready to speak the language of magic and accept it. But when I talk mainly about the idea of leadership if we consider this like a personal trait or a personal set of skills this is something that transcends any business you find yourself into. Does it make sense? So some business and some products may benefit of the language of magic more than others but when we come to leadership I think given it this is a personal inner setup this is something that is transcends any specific business. Does the language of magic work in any language? Pretty much yes I would say so yeah and the more language you know the more your nuances of making magic happen through language will make your magic richer. So in the lore of magic a magic spell is basically a piece of language properly crafted and properly designed to make things happen. So without any delving into any new age quantum gibberish just sticking to the psychological and linguistic implication of it is already enough not only the symbolic ones of course to make to explore hidden nuances embedded in the language. So if a magician performing in English well if you are able to tune in into the language signal of the person you perform for that's the trick you need of course to address people in the language that they can understand. What about the practice of magic? Has most surprised you most taking you? Would you specifically mean with this? What have you been from your experience with magic? What have you maybe experienced that surprised you because you didn't expect? So what surprised me in my practice as magic consultant? What surprised me? Well surprises me when people come up with fresh and new ideas that are astonishing or they come up with a new bits and pieces of a new piece of customer experience that maybe they were under your nose they were somehow latent and when you bring them into attention and you make them manifest it's like bringing a new piece of something from a hidden reel into visibility and that's for me it's always an amazing moment when you just manifest and show a piece of a piece of idea that didn't you didn't see before. Can you give some examples? Yes. Well I think that this is every example is so specific for the experience that you create that taking out of context might sound like a trivial or superficial. It's not that I don't want to give you examples but the creation of a new product which whose evolution who's unfolding I have followed it's a piece of magical thing because it brings into a margin something that was not there before so just the creation of a piece of new product of a piece of new service that is specific for the company that's where the magic lies for me okay just following this whole process from the beginning till its manifestation in reality. Can you tell us something specific that you suggested from Mikey or that came out by your consultation with Mikey that we can relate to? I'm not sure this is something that we can disclose here. Sorry about that so I think it's a little bit to articulate might take some time so I will be willing to do this after the presentation. Thank you. Yes. Do you believe creating magical experiences and innovation is a talent you're born with or skill that you can learn? I totally believe it's a skill that you can learn. It's a set of ideas and memes generally speaking that you can definitely explore and put in practice so it's definitely something that you can learn. Yes and again my royal road to this would be the book list that I suggested so that will be that will open up many doors that will give you directions on how to deal with it. How did you learn magic? Like many young magician kid since I was a kid started as a hobby and then at some point it became my profession. What type of things do you do during the day to bring magical experiences to your life? So how I access what I do personally to have magical experiences. So of course I collect experiences. I try to expose myself to a variety to a rich variety of very different experiences and arts being a big share of it and arts in the form of movies, theater piece, contemporary arts, conceptual arts and I would say that the rest of the big slice is books. I deeply believe that books even in this postmodern ebooks time era read on your screen and surf the web. Books are still offers still the highest quality of information that you can access and besides that it's another way of opening up your mind to a reading experience to tap into very subtle energies. So I would definitely say that books are still a good share of how I personally access magical experiences beside the one that happened in 3D, 3D dimensional life and keeping exposing myself to wow things. So that's of course that's my menu. Yeah. So the question is how what is the ratio of people who are sensitive to this language of magic and who are the cynical and how I deal with them if I try to convert them. Is that correct? I would not say I try to convert them. I think that magic as an art form, as a performing arts, some people are drawn to it. Other people totally rejected. Like many people hate to go to a jazz concert and people do not go to movies or people do not listen to music generally speaking. So there is not one side fits all art form and so I would say that people who are sensitive or have an intuition of a feeling that this narrative of magic is meaningful or interesting or activate curiosity, that's somehow the people who naturally and organically are getting content with. When we come to the cynical again back to the idea that no matter how you try, this is not something. This is very the narrative and the language of magic is something very fragile. You cannot push it to make someone get it. You cannot force it if for some reason you have an intuition that this is something that makes sense. Otherwise you just as another meme, you just, you can drop it. But I do not believe that it's something that you can force or you can sell or you can persuade, not even convert, someone who's not already somehow in tune with this kind of vibration. You used a video by Richard Wasman who's quite big in the modern skeptical band. Yes. There are many magicians in the modern skeptical community. And the goal of that is to show people how easily they were feeling. Are you suggesting to a client that food leadership is really about fooling people? That's a good question. So the question is, as Richard Wasman and many magicians are skeptics and so they fight against false belief system. The question is if I am suggesting that leadership is something that has to do with fooling one another. I don't think I have used the word fool neither once. No, I don't agree with how much of the skeptic the banker's conversation is led because I believe that many magicians, the magicians that support this fight are somehow integralist, a rational integralist in their own way. So they are in my idea, they're not even skeptics, they are rational narrow reality tunnel people who are not even able to conceive that there is something that goes beyond what we do not understand. So they say that if you cannot measure it, if you cannot touch it with your hand, it doesn't exist. And this is in my perception, my perspective, this is a limited view of reality. So, back to the idea of trying to fool other people, no, I don't believe it. I don't believe that leadership is as nothing to do with fooling other people. I believe that leadership, in this magicians leadership format, is a way of engaging people, empowering people and letting them buy your own narrative because they share, they found it meaningful and resonant with how they feel. And so leadership is a way of playfully seducing people to play on a project, to devolve their energies to a goal which they deeply believe that it's worthwhile pursuing. Thank you for asking. My final magic trick will be a piece of language magic, which will be the story with which we are going to close in a moment, just right now. So thank you for asking. And the final piece of magic, which I consider might such, because magic is when we say magic trick, basically the trick is a tool to induce a state of wonder or astonishment. But like the famous Zen metaphor of the finger pointing to the moon, if you just look at the finger, you lose the beauty of the moon. So the finger is just a tool pointing towards something else. So in this sense, this last piece, it's a magic trick and I hope you get it with the proper intention of it. So to close this conversation, I have this final image and the story. This is the image. This is an image that most of you have seen multiple times. It is called Earthrise, and it's been shot in 1968 by the crew of astronauts from Apollo 8, that were the first bunch of people that escaped the Earth gravitational field. And in that moment, the United States president was Lindon Johnson. And one of his last acts as president was to send this picture to all the leaders, all the political leaders of the planet, even the ones with whom he had no diplomatic relationship. And in Lindon Johnson's intentions, sending this image was an invitation to reconsider from this transformational perspective, to reconsider our endeavours on the planet, our divides and our challenges as a whole. This is what Buckminster Fuller called using a very beautiful metaphor. This is spaceship Earth, which is a very beautiful collective metaphor to make sense of what this image means. And so all of this to say that as magician leaders, we have to basically take the goal is to take responsibility and to be able to think in a systemic way, which means being able to recognize that everything is connected with everything else. And so from this perspective, the magician leader is someone who is able to magician leader being a business person, an entrepreneur, or a politician.
