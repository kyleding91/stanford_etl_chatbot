 Who you are defines how you build. This is Thought Leaders Revisited, a special summer 2020 edition of our entrepreneurial Thought Leaders series. During this summer of uncertainty, we're inviting some of the most influential past ETL speakers to join us for a series of new conversations about innovation, leadership, and especially finding opportunities in the midst of a crisis. On this episode, we're joined by Stockton Mayor Michael Tubbs. He's Stockton's youngest and first African American mayor. He's known for launching the Stockton Scholars Program, which aims to triple the number of students entering and graduating from college. In addition, under his leadership, Stockton became one of the first cities to join a basic income pilot. Welcome back to ETL. Thank you so much for having me. So good to see you. It's so great. Now, first I want to wish you a 30 happy 30th birthday. I know you had a birthday just recently. And I must say you have done more in your 20s than most people have done in the lifetime. So in this talk, we're going to do something special. We're going to both reflect upon your visit back four years ago and you came to Stanford and look to the future of what you're thinking about now. So we're going to place some short clips along the way and highlight some of the remarkable work that you're doing as Stockton's mayor. So I'd like to go back, take the way back machine and start with a clip where you really talk about listening to your users and extreme users in your community to really understand what the real needs are. So let's start with clip number one. We started with what I learned at the D-school to be done as extreme users. We started one of poor housing developments in the city, probably not with a lot of voters. And we spent two weeks just knocking on every door there talking to them about their hopes, their aspirations, and what they wanted for the city. But it was then talking to this extreme user group, the group that wasn't on our nation builder files that won't show up on voter registration roles that we found our campaign message. It was really one about moving the city forward in that many communities have felt bankrupt for a long time. That the city's financial bankruptcy was only a symptom of a deeper bankruptcy in leadership, a moral bankruptcy and a bankruptcy of vision. And that's what we ran on. So everyone was talking about the fiscal constraints and bankruptcy really important topics. But for voters, they want to talk about what's the vision for Stockton? Well, that was super impressive. Okay, even back then, you were really using what you learned in school to figure out how could you address the real needs of the community. So who are the extreme users that you're talking to now in your community to help shape the policies that you're putting in place? Well, wow. I probably should have watched my talk before this one. That was great to see. I think a lot of that work happened to me over while in my term as mayor. So to answer your question, the extreme users we're listening to now are a residential homeless and you figure it out sort of like sustainable solution to deal with the homelessness issue. That's a crisis in Stockton as is in much of the same California. The other user group we've been listening to a lot are the guys most likely to be victims of perpetrators of outland crime. We spend a lot of time listening and meeting with them and do so about one supporter. And then for the basic income pattern, we listen to sort of Stocktonian who are one paycheck away for a one 500 or emergency away from really financial ruin. And I think and again, it's so refreshing seeing that clip because I think more so this is just really becoming better. How I am I team trying to make policies, particularly around kind of big ideas. It really starts with listening and figuring out sort of who are we designing said policy for and what exactly are these that we're trying to be. Yeah, it's super impressive. I mean, it's funny in four years to think how much you were able to accomplish. Now, you mentioned the basic income program that you put in place. I know that's been such a revolutionary project that a lot of people are looking to Stockton to get some insights. Can you tell us a little bit about it? Some people might not be as familiar. So one of the first things I do as mayor was identifying the issue of poverty and economic insecurity being kind of intersectional and the corrupt. So a lot of issues were facing in the city. So now I learned about basic income through studying doctor King at Stanford. We talked about this before he was murdered. And we decided to do a pilot called seed Stocktonian Economic and Parent Administration. And I know Stanford students love to research. If you look at Stocktonian Administration.org, you can see all the data. But essentially for 18 months, I mean, we just didn't need it for another six. We were able to give 125 ramens like the families. I look like our city founders are in one. And what we found is that $500 is not enough to replace work or to make people stop working or to make Stockton not part of the United States of America. But it hasn't been enough to make work paid to provide income flow and to provide peace of mind and the ability for people to take risk. One of my favorite stories is from one you just did it until Moss who told me that with his first $500, he went in the interview. And at first, I was amazed when he told me that, but you're thinking to all these stereotypes, a while you paid money to be interviewed to him, off. That makes no sense. And he said, no, Mayor, I work hourly, which means I don't have paid time off, which means if I take time off to interview, that's $200 on my pocket and you live page at the page and I can't take that risk. But with the $500, I was able to be entrepreneurial. I was able to take time off work, take the risk of that on myself. And now I have a better job with more benefits, less hours. I'm able to do more of my kids. And stories like that have been so inspiring to me. And I think again, particularly during this time with COVID-19 and people unable to work or people being told, if you're coughing or having a fever, don't work, but also being told you have to pay your bills and don't have paid time off or being in our wages having an increase in inflation. That I'm just more resolute than ever that we have to have some for the guaranteed income and income floor. Not for everyone, for the vast majority of people, for a lot of people to build a resilience, but also for a lot of people to be entrepreneurs and don't like to make decisions about what to do to pay for the car no to pay for tutoring to to start that business. So, they started with sort of a deep design session for a year with community groups listening. And that's what made me a believer, Tina, is realizing that no folks know how to spend money. I could trust the people who I trust and to vote for me to know how to spend money, but a lot of the kids came from listening and sitting with people in their environment to hear them tell me how they would use $500 before we even disperse any money. So, how did you pick $500? And how did you pick 18 months? Like, what were the, what were the reasons and the ways that you scope this project? I mean, we have, we have real researchers who are PhDs who had some rigorous analysis, but from my layman's back at this point, we were able to get a million dollar grant, and we just did the math and we said, okay, well, we could do a thousand, we could get $2,000, $1,000, $1,500. What we found was $500 was enough to give us to a longer period of time 18 months where there's some more rigorous conclusions could be drawn from the data because of the length of time. We sell our $5 a month because one into Americans can afford the $1,500 emergency, so I numbered the sold, right? And it filled to big, like $500. That, it's a lot that's that too big. And then number three, I literally sat in it back to the envelope and add up my internet bill, my light bill, my water bill, my trash bill. And it was about $500. So I was like, well, look, this is a good amount that will pay for a lot of, a lot of bills for people. And so, so we sell on $500, which I think is great because we're showing that if $500 is beneficial, it's going to be a floor. And anything more would be better. But at the very least, you know, $500 is still a matter for a lot of people. Yeah, super interesting. So you'd ran it for 18 months, right? And then did it stop? No, so it was supposed to stop in July, but then the marked COVID happened. And we were hearing from recipients and others about how they were waiting for an employment insurance, which they qualified for, which they paid into, which they still haven't received. And their bills kept coming and like the $500 was their lifeline. It was the only thing that was keeping them afloat, which was very scary for me as a mayor of 300,000 plus people. I'm going to go to the level where these people in the basic income program are fine, but what about the 300,000 other people I represented, how are they making it? And then folks were saying that they needed the $500 because there's forced to quarantine, they're forced to stay home. They're not driving Uber anymore. They're they've been laid off. Their kids are home more and else. It's been more off-food. It became very apparent that we had it will be inhumane to stop the program, midst of the pandemic. So we're able to extend the program to January, which I think is important because we're able to do research around how basic income is not just, it's particularly important times of crisis. That is a pandemic response as a way to build national resilience. Economic security has to be a part of that. And now we'll have the next nine months to illustrate that. So we're going to continue to January. And then at the same token two months ago, I started a group called Marish for Guarantee Income, which includes 20 Marish, including the Mara of Atlanta, the Mara of LA, the Mara of Oakland, the Mara St. Paul, etc. Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and New Orleans, who are all saying that we need a national guaranteed income during this time. And they're all going to be proud of the stuff we've done in the stock. And particularly because COVID-19 is very clear, and we have to make sure people have the tools for the basics at least. Well, it's so interesting because I want to play the next clip, which is very closely aligned to this, where you talk about the relationship between profits and policy. And you know, should you let profits drive policy or do you make a policy that then you figure out, okay, here's a policy, but now we're going to have to figure out how to fund it and make it work. So let's watch the second clip and then talk about how you sort of try to turn this around. I'm extremely worried about my kid axing me one day, like why dad in a time with all these technological advancements and all this good stuff, people figuring out how to live on Mars and all in the moon. And you guys are the black president, but people still had to go to the streets and tell people that black lives matter. I'm worried. I'm really frankly afraid about what happens when we let profit determine policy. And I think we've seen some of that with the private prison industry, where literally private prison corporations have helped write the country's criminal justice policies for the past 20 years. I'm worried that will spend all our time and all our energy and all our smart on making cool products, but really forgetting about people. You have been totally consistent here and in the way that you have been approaching your role. So how do you do this? I mean, how do you think about the role of financial support for the types of policies that you're trying to implement? Yeah, well, I think private, Tina, is understanding that profit in and of itself isn't bad. The idea of making money and doing well isn't a bad idea. What is bad is that that becomes the overriding rationale for policy. My job as a policy maker isn't just to make some people money. My job as a policy maker is to create the conditions where everyone can do well. And I think even now as mayor, I'm just saying that so much more now that folks who have influence and folks who have access are able to influence policy in a way that not only drives profit, but also hurts people and also does allow other people to enjoy some of the growth. So I'm not sure I'm answering your question. So what was the question? Yeah, well, I was just thinking about how what drives? How do you figure out what policies you want and then how do you figure out how to support them? These things are very expensive. Universal makeup basic income. In fact, I want to just even underline that because one of the questions and a lot of the listeners are asking about is how do you come up with the idea for universal basic income and how did you even get support? So it's a perfect example. Here's a big idea. How do you then go under support for something that feels so radical and expensive? Got it. No, I think for me, for most things we look at as a team is the satchel untenable. That's our first question. Like, can we not live if this doesn't change? What we feel if this doesn't change? If the dance was yes, that gives us the courage, the energy, the moxie to move forward with, okay, then how do we find a solution that very worse is a little bit better than the status quo? So we're making progress. So that's kind of the decision making matrix. Then once that happens, I was lucky enough on the basic income front to meet the economic security project when the culture was down the fostering event for a tech for Americans and for Cisco. And we talked about how they had desire to do a pilot for a basic income. At the same time, I had my staff researching tools to eradicate poverty and basic income growth to the top. So I was able in that way to do public private partnership. And I tell you all the time, public-minded partnerships are great to test ideas because to your point about taxpayer dollars, even though we waste a lot of them on crazy things like space wars and things like that sort, there's still a finite resource. And we still should be as good stewards, mindful of how we're spending money. So public-prior partnerships are helpful to test ideas. And that's what we did with the basic income program. 18 months we tested all the money we funded. And now with this group of mergers, Merstreg and to income, we're advocating for taxpayer funds. We're saying, okay, the idea's been tested. Now we have to scale it because charity, or the thing I say, and that's being shared in justice, programs are policy. And we have to incubate ideas. But then when we know it works, then we have to scale it. So to answer your question, private just comes from understanding how expensive the cost of an action is. That we don't do anything. How much will we continue to pay? And also just that I get a staff's call in many cases. Or in some cases, just is not sustainable. It doesn't work. And as leaders, we are called to address those issues. And you can do that with everything. But there's one, two, three, four, five issues where you absolutely have to at least create this society that I argue that we all deserve to live in. I think it's a really good point. Is it doing nothing is expensive? Right? I mean, if you're in a situation where things are really not working, it becomes very expensive to be inactive. So there's a question that a lot of people are curious about. Politics is very divisive right now. What is your approach to building coalitions to get meaningful things done? Yeah, I think and stopped it. I'm lucky in a sense because by council is for Republicans in two Democrats. And I have to get four votes to get anything done. So anything we voted on, I've had to work with both Republicans and Democrats. And some of the most influential people in the business community, my community, are Republican. So I think part of it is just understanding that you have to work together. That as some of those are practices and heart and who likes to get things done, I understand I have to work with people. I may not agree about on the hundred issues. If I agree with you on this issue, I will work with you and congratulate you and amplify you for your great work on this issue while knowing we may have to find out an issue tomorrow. So I think that's part of it. And I think for me, even though the policy is personal, the politics isn't, meaning that I am deeply impacted by a problem like the work I do with personal. And I try to be harder on policy but soft on people. So I try to go drive part on this what we need to do is we need to do. If we have to disagree about what we disagree, if you have to have publicly viewed publicly viewed, the next day realized I might need to work with you. So the next day said, bye guys, bye guys, let's figure out what we can agree on this issue. So I think that's part of it. I think part of it is also especially the local level, you could invest the time and relationship building. Because I think because of the diversity of stockman, not just ethnically but politically, I have learned so much about how I'm more conservative constituents and more conservative colleagues think about things or how they hear things. I think it's made me a more effective communicator, more effective messenger. And so I'll need to consider issues from a different vantage point, which may not be my frame. Even if I always agree with it. So I think it's been a useful kind of tool and skill, but underlying all this is this idea that I'm going to get things done. Things have to get done. You won't get anything important done. Just work with people who agree with you all the time. You'll do some things. But for the big thing, you have a big 10 of people who may not agree with you again on every issue, but you found some common ground on this one. I love this because although you didn't use the word empathy, you really talk about having incredible empathy for the people who have different points of view. And I'm sure you learn a lot from them. So I wanted to point out, we have a number of people who have written comments about just how they're big fans of yours. One person said, I went to Stanford with you and I remember your commencement speech about growing up in Stockton and I'm so impressed with what you've done. Another person said, I went to Stockton, to High School in Stockton before you were born and to Stanford too. And I'm just so impressed. And this person wants to know if you're running for re-election, which I think you are. Yes, I am running for re-election up 83 days to November. I'm looking forward to it and thank you for all the people for the world. Wish it was so funny. I hear people say they were there for that convocation. I think speech about means you're four years younger than me, which makes me feel of some type of way, but I appreciate it. Great. Well, let's go on to the next video clip. So I love this one a lot because when you started, you were just beginning. You were just starting your political career and you basically talk about the fact that you didn't have experience and you had to learn from other people and the importance of really being a good listener and asking a lot of questions. So let's play, clip number three about this and then talk about who you're listening to now. There's a lot of pressure to feel like you're the expert, but I realized that in not knowing everything has been so freeing because open the door for me to connect with people who do have the answers. So it's been great to work on issues like poverty and realize that I have some staff for the experience and lived experience, but there are some subject matter experts who've been doing this work in this community for 25 years, who may not have the degrees or the pedigree, but they know what they're talking about. And spend so freeing to say you guys, you know what? I don't know. I don't know. I know that someone knows, so let's find this answer collectively. So don't feel pressure to know all the answers or have all the answers because part of, in my opinion, entrepreneurship and iteration is not knowing what you're doing is going to work. It's the iteration and experimentation that leads to knowledge. The knowledge is not already baked in. I'm curious though, as you become an expert and get, you know, more experience, who do you continue to go to and do you worry that if you go to people who've done it before, you're going to get the same old answers as opposed to something fresh and new. So how do you gather new and fresh ideas? So generally, I try to go to the people who've been doing it because even if I disagree or even if I want something new, for me, it's important to understand what's working in a status quo or why something's the way it is because I found that oftentimes there may be a policy reason, an administrative reason, a grant report. There's oftentimes there's a reason, whether you agree there are not, there's a reason for a certain behavior or a certain outcome. So I'm always curious for the people who are working like, okay, why is it like this? Because I hope to be great different solutions, which may look different than what I originally imagined. And then number two, I think I still know the experts. So for example, just important to the host commission for the state. So by out, within the 15 people who determine police standards for the state of California, when the first or second largest police force in this country. And I'm a mayor, I'm never went to police training. So I've had meetings with the community college chancellor who had overseas lobby training to hear where his pain points are. I've talked with my police chief about what we like to see better. I've talked with residents of my community and I've also spent time with the Center for Policing Equity, the nation's experts on policing to understand from them sort of what needs to be done. And from all those inputs and then from my own research, I come up with kind of okay, it's what I'm going to advocate for is what I'm going to push. I think I try to do that on every issue. I'm usually once a week on a call with someone who's a subject magic expert, a policy person. I'm Ross Chetty who used to be a Stanford, I used to bug his office all the time, every time they issue a report to understand sort of with your opportunity index, what does mean for Stockton, how do I operationalize and how do I do it. So definitely still part in core of my governing philosophy is because I think oftentimes leadership is not being a subject magic expert. It's about kind of using values to guide priorities, resource allocation, and just decision making. But as a me, you have to know everything. You have to know sort of, you should be smart, be able to read and please synthesis, but you don't have to be the ex-part of everything. But you should be the expert, I go into experts and people and understand what's happening on the ground and use their information and put it in conversation with sort of the values you have to kind of come to to to to decisions and the benefit of all people in the community. I love the idea of being an expert on going to experts. So that's a that's a great line to remember. So we have a number of students who are really curious enough how how do you prepare to go into a life in politics that you know they're saying you know what sort of skills and capabilities should they be developing if they aspire to go into a life of service like you. I think in terms of service, never went to about service. We sound very basic, but Dr. Keen talked about using our conversation at Jesus' power and his disciples about this idea of a drum major instinct and intrinsic and all human beings is this desire to be the drum major to be first. And you was saying that when Jesus told Peter and Paul, can you be the left and the right for the grace of you should be the servant of all. And Dr. Keen interpreted that to mean that the drum major instinct isn't of itself isn't bad, but the idea of going to be first or wanting to be important because I have to be connected to purpose to be a drum major for justice, be a drum major for peace, be a drum major for something. So I think that's the most important thing is understand why do you want to run? What are you running for? And then what do you want to do? Because I think oftentimes people run with the idea of getting to office, but they're going to office they're unsure of what to do because they don't really run to do something, they ran to be something. We need more people who are running to do something. I love that. The wisdom that you're sharing is is just wonderful. In fact, this next clip is one I think that is particularly powerful, especially for the students in the room. And you talk about the fact that you didn't intend to run for office. This is not when you went to school. This was not your, and that if ended up resulting after you know some real big disappointments where the path you thought you were going to take got closed. And you know some opportunities that you basically said you know what I need to do this. So let's play this clip for fourth clip about how you know the pains you experienced actually unlocked the door to your passions. So I told my mom you know what mom? One day when I'm 30, 34, 38, 42, 50, I'll come back to Stockton and help out because this city really needs help. But then my senior year I was applying for fellowships and jobs and I didn't get what I thought was mine. I was at the entitled Stanford student. I had good grades. I had worked hard. I had the best regs. I had the best resume. I thought for sure that was my job and my purpose in life to be a Rhodes scholar. And that's just what was going to happen for me. So I put all my eggs in that basket and then the workout for me. So they're never being so upset, so hurt. Like I thought I found my purpose. This one's supposed to be doing it. No, I can't do it. And I start with that because in all these value experiences, all these low points, whether growing up in poverty or losing my cousin or not getting the fellowship that really clarified the path I was going to take. This is super important. So yeah, the idea that the lowest lows helped you unlock your path. So what allowed you to actually get out of that most spot? You know, a lot of people hit bottom and it's super difficult to get out. What was it that allowed you to get unstuck as opposed to becoming you know bitter and broken? I think it's just my spiritual practice and he's coming from a community of faith that speaks to sort of all things happen for a reason. And that even when bad things happen, part of the journey of being here in this cell mock and trying to understand what God, the higher power, what once you don't understand Americanist experience. So that was super helpful. Just having a faith tradition as teachers that like everything's happening for a reason. It feels terrible. So it's hearing, okay, how can this be used for a greater day? And then number two, I think is realizing that as I think as I said, rejection is just a redirection that this you're doing everything right. If you know you've done your best that maybe the know was a good thing and maybe there's something else that's more enlightening to what you should be doing in the rejection when it was a way to get you there. What's easier said than done? I mean, I wasn't happy. I was upset. That was like, I felt like a failure. I felt dumb. Being a road scholar felt a lot safer, a lot more conventional, a lot more like makes sense than like running for city council. So like even afterwards, as soon as the run for council wasn't easy one to make. It was it was pretty scary. But you always look smarter looking back, like looking back, it makes so much sense. But in that moment, we just understand our rejection also is in permanent and that no one lives linearly. No one's life is when where everything happens the way you went to happen or everything happens the way you do it go. And that the best things happen actually when you're rejected, when you face some resilience, you have to figure out how to get through when you look back like, oh wow, I'm so happy I was rejected. You know, I love again your line about rejection is really about a redirection and using thinking like, you know what, I'm probably I'm not going to the right direction. That's a message assigned. So there are a lot of people who are pointing out and this is very critical point that we are living in a very unusual and very special moment in time where the nation is grappling with, you know, racism and inequality. And you know, in your position as mayor, what do you recommend to aspiring students who really want to help build systems that are actively anti-racist and foster more more equitable society? Yeah, well, I think first of all, it's understanding that this is a marathon not a script. I mean that we're talking about 400 years of a history that we're confronting with. It doesn't mean we have to be diagnostic and it doesn't mean we don't need to push in demand, but it doesn't mean we need to be realistic and understand that this we have to take care of ourselves and have a strategy for the next 50, 60, 70, 100 years. Number two, I think when Stanford comes immense privilege and I tell people all the time, don't apologize for their privilege but put purpose to it. And a big way to put purpose to it is to allow other people who may have more experience who may actually be very quick to work on the issues you want to work on. A seat next to you after table. I think one of the things I'm conscious of as mayor is making sharp big as many people in with me to the table because I know that I'm able to get there because I want to stand for them to mayor and they may not although they're more impacted but what happened I'm just confused with an album because my privilege insulates me from a law of the insidious impacts of bad policy oftentimes. Number three, I would say be educated. Read, read, read, learn, listen so you're equipped. And number four, understand that no matter where you go because what we're talking about in terms of racism, white supremacy is ubiquitous, meaning that it's not just in politics, it's not just in policing, it's in every institution in our country, which means when you're in the tech board room, when you're creating your startup, when you're like no matter what you're doing, you have to actually make sure you're fighting against and not perpetuating the systems you want to change. And then we also have to acknowledge that for some of us, there's real benefit to the current system. And to understand that in changing these systems, you may be giving yourself less privilege. You may be giving yourself less thought. You may be giving yourself less opportunity to drive the agenda and be comfortable with that because that's part of this process is understanding that so many folks have been excluded, marginalized, needing to be bringing more people in. You might not have as large a slice of the pie as you maybe used to to enjoy, which isn't a bad thing. But I just want to be realistic about this, what we're talking about. We're talking about making more people in expanding opportunity and giving the ability to lead, the ability to be part of conversation to folks who have traditionally been left out in marginalized, which means some of us have to shut up, some of us have to be quiet, some of us have to listen and leave that way. So that was really helpful. I mean, I think that we probably have to listen to that many times over and internalize all those insights and recommendations. This leads us actually to the final clip that I want to share is one where you talk about the difference between charity and justice. And how important is, I mean, when I hear this clip, I hear that charity is important, but that's in the short term. We really need to make some really systemic changes. So let's watch this clip and then talk about, you know, in this moment in time, what is the balance of need for charity and justice? Charity is what we do when it feels good and it's important, but justice is the hard work of surgery, surgery of what it takes to move the country forward. And then I also think that in terms of our own work, that charity is me throwing resources at an issue and making the assumption that the problem is one of resources. If they had more of this, if they have more in that, if I give to them what I have, then that solves the problem. But justice is really about putting myself, my brain, my resources, my talent, my time in my body and on the line in a way until we really get out of solution. And that's not sexy, that's not easy, that's incredibly difficult, but that's the only way we as a society will progress in my humble opinion. Okay, so that is a strong statement. So what do you think about? I mean, I'm sure you want people to donate and give money to the initiatives that you're running, right? That might feel like charity if you want me to write a chat. Okay, so I think you want people to do that, but then justice is longer term. So can you talk a little bit about the balance between these two? Yeah, absolutely. I think charity is necessary but not sufficient. That charity is important to do, because as we work for these larger structural changes and ideals, we have to deal with the problems of today. So charity isn't a bad thing. I think charity becomes a bad thing, what that's all we do. And the underlying conditions I did rise the need for charity aren't in dress. So I think like most things I like to have my cake and eat it to is like a bone and something charity is something that's necessary and that's that charity is not bad. It's necessary. That's necessary. And charity is a great entrepreneur to adjust this work, because in giving to charity or donating to charity or helping to charity, you're implicitly acknowledging that something's wrong. That I'm doing more that I should be doing or I'm giving more because this is not right. So then the next step and to adjust this, you ask why is it not right? And it's usually some underlying structure or policy reason that gives rise to need for charity. And I think without rigorous questioning and analysis, we can all hold ourselves more accountable to do charity, but to make sure our charity goes further. And the best way to make our charity goes further is that it's in service of justice. I understand we're getting dollars, we're getting resources, we're helping who we can while the same time pushing and advocating and voting in a way that brings us more aligned to a day where our charity is not needed anymore. Interesting. So this leads to one of the questions that's been asked by the students, which is they're studying entrepreneurship. And they're saying in venture as we learn about business models and competitive strategies, how does this translate into politics? Like what's the business model that underpins the things that you're doing? And maybe is the business model of combination of charity and justice? How do you think about that? Yeah, I think like charity is like making payroll, but justice is the reserves. And particularly in the time we know that they kind of goes like this, if you're just barely making payroll every quarter, you're not going to be successful business long term, you're not going to be able to pivot with things like COVID-19 happens. I think it's the same way for a society that we have to make sure at the very least we make payroll, but that's not enough. We can invest in new technologies, we can't invest in new pivots, we cannot withstand storms and our doings paying payroll. So I think charity is payroll, but justice is the reserves necessary to be able to pivot, to be able to invest, to be able to research, to try and to iterate. And you can't do that if you're just barely paying people on their hourly wages under salaries. So there's a question about, especially in this very unusual time, are you seeing more community led as your bottoms up change as well as topstown city led? And you're seeing more diversity in the types of groups that are getting involved with helping them make change of the community. Yeah, I think that over the past four years, particularly now, people are saying that even though we like North-Town, these are our guys, we have to also be part of the conversation on driving change. All the answers can't come from city hall or can't come from one person. So during COVID-19, a lot of initiatives like Stockton Strong, which is a group of the community coming together to provide mutual assistance and information to each other. The South-Walking United, which is a group talked about how to hold our county government accountable for delivering services to people during this time, has really reflected an idea that the community understands that they too have a role to play, that they too have to lead and they too have to play. So absolutely, I've seen more community led leadership. And also, there's diverse, I'm in terms of our community. There's this discussion when the groups had about women of color in Stockton in leadership and highlighting their work and some of their day face. So I'm actually proud of the way that's been progressing in this city. Great. Well, obviously great progress. There are a number of people who are very curious about your long-term political aspirations. I'm sure people ask you all the time. Do you aspire to hire office, governor, president? I think you're starting to get a following here. So what do you think about this or are you really rooted just in Stockton right now? So I definitely think about the future. I'm excited. I'm running for reelection. But I think in 2024, I'll be termed out as mayor. And then there'll have to be a conversation with my wife about sort of the sacrifices. If you have time and energy invested in the political world, is it worth it? Because there's a lot of ways to make a difference. I spent a lot of my time talking with philanthropists, for example. I spent a lot of my time even with organizers and advocates, for example, I spent a lot of my time talking to business people, for example. And they all had media people. They all have been prevalent through its time to shaping culture and bringing resources and providing opportunity. So to answer your question, I'm not sure long-term what office or if any office are being, but I know I'll continue to work on the issues I talked about for years ago. I'm still talking about now. And namely, having created the opportunity structure in this country, that's reflected to what we say on paper. That we really believe that all people are creating equal. That we actually do believe that everyone has inherent human dignity. And if that's in the government role, I'll do that, but it's another role. I'll do that as well. So open to title, but very clear about vocation. And that's just to create a better opportunity structure in this country. Really, thank you for that. The idea is it doesn't matter exactly the title, but you're going to be working on having an impact on your community. So I would like to sort of take the way back machine. We looked four years ago, but let's go back to when you were a student. What do you wish you knew? It's not that long ago. When you wish you knew when you were sitting in the classroom watching people give talks like this. And then let's flash forward a little bit. And then what do you wish you knew when you started in politics? What sort of insights have you gained over those years that would have changed your trajectory in any way? I did a fairly good job of this by wish I had new works. Physically, just how much college was about the classes that took more importantly about the people I met in the relationships I filmed and forged. Some of them I got my wife at Stanford. I met Evan Spiegel, one of my closest friends who's been a great partner in the working stocking at Stanford. Met some of my best friends at Stanford, but I had no idea going in that the most important part of college would be building relationships with as many people as possible. Because in five, 10, 20, 30 years, these are the people who are going to help shape the world. I think I did a fairly good job, but I wish I had spent just more time being intentional about spending time with the people. Not in a weird networking way, but I just want to build relationship with all the folks I can because these are the people who are going to help create the world that we're living. In terms of my time as an awesome, great person because I realized people have lost memory. So to all the students watching and listening, treat everybody well. You have no idea when you need somebody, when somebody will come up at a dinner conversation, when somebody will be a gatekeeper or someone needs to, someone has a key to a connection and people remember how you treat them. So don't be a weird, don't be a jerk, introduce everyone well. In terms of the beginning of my political career, I wish I had learned that change only moves at the speed of trust. So you can have the best ideas, but if you don't spend time in community building trust, we're going to report with people, it'll be very difficult in your face opposition. And also the fact that even when you're doing well and doing things well, you have to go back and report to your people because what you're doing up here may not be felt on the ground or understood on the ground in that environment chaos, the misinformation can spread. So I wish someone had told me the importance of this over communicating and saying things over and over and over again about the things we're doing so that there's a common normal patient and common narrative of community because the work was. Well, I love doing every one of your answers. There's some comment you make that I just want to get written down and put on a tattoo. I don't know. This one is change happens at the speed of trust. Honestly, I think that's something we should all remember that without that trust, you can't make things happen. Michael, may or tubs, you are in a true inspiration. I know that our team at Stanford, the students who have, you know, looked to you as an inspiration, the community that watches is so inspired by you. And what you've done in a few years really sets the bar high for all of us to make really, really positive change in the world. So thanks so much. Thank you. Thanks for having me.
