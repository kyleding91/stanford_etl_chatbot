 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. This week we have incredible pleasure to welcome Tim Draper as our entrepreneurial thought leader lecturer. Now just a few years ago he was sitting in your chairs because he got his degree in electrical engineering here at Stanford. How many of you have an electrical engineering department? Okay great, you could be the future Tim Draper. And he then went on and went to Harvard Business School and just shortly thereafter he founded Draper Fisher Dervidsen or what became Draper Fisher Dervidsen. Now I've known Tim for many years and the thing I want to tell you is no idea is due too big and too exciting for him. He's going to tell you about his insights and his attitude and his point of view about venture capital and about entrepreneurship and I want to tell you he is a guy who gets things done. So without further ado, Tim. Well thank you, thank you Tina. Tina is terrific by the way. This is this whole program, everything about it is great and she has also joined the board of Draper University which is I'll tell you a little bit about later. But first I think we need a moment of silence for Reg, what's his last name? Presley. Because he wrote, you do know, wild thing. Okay, not silence, everybody get up and go, wow thing. Okay ready, one, two, three, everybody up. Wow thing. You make my heart sing. Okay. He died today, it was a very sad moment for me. Anyway it's a thrill to be here at the Stanford Thought Leader Program and what I thought I do is kind of go through four concepts so that you can kind of get the idea. And the best way to do this I think is we start with Tina and Tina I want you to give high fives to as many people as you can. As soon as you get a high fives stand up, give high fives to as many people as you can and pass high fives all the way until everybody is standing up. Ready, one, two, three, go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah, that's great. I think it's my wish I would stand still have reached that corner. Okay, there we go. Okay, that was good. That was good. Okay, everybody can go sit back down. Okay, that's viral marketing and that was the idea I came up with when we did Hotmail to put a little message at the bottom of everybody's screen to say get your free email at Hotmail. Actually the original idea was PS, I love you, get your free email at Hotmail. But the founders didn't want to do that and to this day I think we would have had a much more loving and peaceful world if we had stuck with PS, I love you, but still now what are there? Billion and a half people now that have some form of web-based email and that was all just we spread it really quickly through these great guys at Hotmail who made that happen. So the second thing what happened was viral marketing took off but then everyone was talking to everyone and a few people were just getting bombed with spam and so that's where Zuckerberg came up with that social media and social marketing so that you could have a sort of a smaller group that you wanted to coordinate with and we won't do a demonstration of that. Now I want to talk about something, these last two I'm very excited about because these are new concepts and they're really making the world really make our lives a lot easier. One is, oh can I get a ride to the airport later on this afternoon? Anybody here? Anybody? Okay, great, okay. That's called crowdsourcing. Okay, everybody was given this opportunity but there was somebody who could get me a ride to the airport and then crowdfunding, who would give one dollar to become to cure lung cancer? I give 10. And he'd give 10. Okay, that's crowdfunding but that guy up there didn't have his hand up. It's only a dollar. Anyway, crowdfunding, I'm going to go into that in some greater depth but those are the four concepts I want you to walk away with and that's basically what they are. This has been my life. I've spent my life dedicating to supporting heroes and you notice that some of these are fantastic heroes. I like the idea of superheroes because they build people's imaginations. If you look back at heroes, that's a great thing because you look back and you say, wow Steve Jobs, what he did, Elon Musk, these guys from Skype, they all had a big impact on society. But the guys who might have had an even bigger impact are the guys who got people thinking in terms of becoming superheroes because that's where your imagination really flies. Now I'm going to do a little pre-roll by this book. My dad wrote it. It's really great. It's about the entrepreneur and the venture capitalist and their relationship. Watch this show. It's my daughter's show. It's a really good show. It's about, you know, she interviews like Ted Turner and gets him to sing Captain Planet with her and it's a very fun show. It's called The Valley Girl. If you need an incubator, this is my son's incubator. Who's funder? This is my fund. Dre Prfisher-Jervitzin, we've been in business now 27, 28 years and we've funded venture entrepreneurs all over the world. And it turns out today is a great day because the first day I realized that we have funded a thousand companies. Wow. Whoa. And they're all over the world. So I started to think about the globe and what it could do for us and how it would expand when I was actually failing in my venture business. We had a little SBIC and it didn't really, wasn't really working out very well. There was no public market like today. And there was a, and I was just struggling along trying to figure out what to do. And some guy from Alaska said, oil is now $5 a barrel. You know what, oil, a barrel of oil costs now. It's like $100 or something. $100 or something. It was $5 a barrel and they were starting to panic because all of their economy came from oil and they said, we need something else. We need venture capital entrepreneurship. And it got me thinking that you could actually do this in other places. Anyway, a lot of global opportunities. There's global warming, global finance, global communications, global health. So we started to think, wow, we ought to really think globally. And part of it was getting a little window. When we funded Hotmail, the founder, Sabir Bhattia sent an email to his friend in India. And within three weeks, we had 100,000 registered Hotmail users in India. And there weren't even 100,000 computers in India at that time. So it was all of a sudden, we realized we could do commerce all over the world. We could spread information all over the world. A lot of great things were going to happen around the world. And so at DFJ, we made this decision to start setting up offices around the world. And we knew that it used to be the Silicon Valley required when I was an electrical engineer. The Silicon Valley, you had to start your electronics business in the Silicon Valley because the disk drive manufacturers were here. The processors were here. The memory devices were here. Everything was here. So you had to, if you were starting a business, you had to build it here. All the printers were here. Everything was here. But then all of a sudden, there were these companies that didn't require any hardware. So we thought, oh my gosh, those could be done anywhere. You can start a business no matter where you are. You've got the same information now on Google and Baidu and whatever. As everybody else in the world, so if you are creative enough, you can start a business that spreads all over the world. And it doesn't have to be here in the Silicon Valley. So now I'm going to tell you about my travels around the world. First of all, I told you a little bit about the hotmail story, but it was two guys, about 25, 26 years old. They came into my office. They had one idea. And then we said, you know, that idea, we don't really think it's going to fly. And as they were walking out, they said, well, we have this other idea. And we said, well, tell us the other idea. Well, the other idea was this free web-based email. And as venture capitalists, all we're thinking about right is money. Money, money, money, money. So they said free. And it was like, what? It fell on 10 years. We thought, you know, they have a lot of hoots for these too. You're going to do something for free. Well, we might as well give it a shot. So we gave them a little bit of money. And the thing was magically appeared. And the reason this is on the India slide is that Severebatiya was Indian. And it was after the viral marketing idea. It spread like crazy. 11 million users in 18 months. And as you know, it's everywhere. My other story about India was, we eventually set up an office in India. And my partner there after my third trip to India said, okay, are you ready to cross an Indian street? I'm looking. And okay, there's a cow coming across. And there's a guy with a rickshaw. And then there's a car zipping through. And a motorcycle coming this way. And it's like seven roads are all converging on the place. I'm supposed to cross. And the baby is crawling across the road. And so I said, okay. And so I get about halfway across. And I see an opening. And I run. And my partner goes, no! And I said, what? I got across. And he goes, no sudden movements. So what is happening in India is everyone is doing partial differential calculus. Every time they cross the street, there are some amazing engineers and software talent coming out of that country for that reason. So then, I'm going to tell you this story. This is fun. My good friend, Tony Perkins, said, hey, will you be at this conference? Will you speak at this conference? And I said, absolutely, be happy to do it. And it was here at Stanford. And I said, and then all of a sudden, we had our first Skype board meeting in Tallinn, Estonia. And it was the same day. What's a mother to do? So I said, Tony, I'm so sorry. I've got to go to this thing. I got to go to this board meeting in Tallinn. And I said, but can maybe we can do it by video conferencing? And that time it was like this. And I said, will Tony, we'll give it a shot and then let's have a phone for a backup? And he goes, yeah, okay. And at that time, Skype was just phone calls, just audio calls. And so I said, Nicholas, oh, and Tony said, well, can you get that guy, Nicholas? And maybe you can do a little Q&A with Nicholas, Zensstrom. And I said, great, yeah, I'd be happy to. And I call Nicholas. Yeah, oh, sure, we'll do it. And he said, video conference. Yeah, yeah, we've been thinking about something like that in the lab. And I said, yeah, yeah, but we need a video conferencing system for this thing. He goes, oh, yeah, yeah, we got it wired. So I get there and I'm setting up and we're in Tallinn and Tony's on the other end of the phone. And I said, Tony, I think we got this thing going. And Tony says, okay, great. And so Nicholas turns to the door and he goes, throw the switch. And I said, what? And he goes, he goes, oh, you know, we were working on this in the back. I think we got a good alpha program going and we're going to do a video conference system. We're going to run it through our own system. And I thought, oh, great. And so then at the end, I said, Tony, how did that come through? And he goes, it was perfect. Oh my gosh, we heard you perfectly. We saw you perfectly. It was amazing. And I said, I turned to Nicholas and I said, how did you do that? And he goes, oh, well, we cut off about 300,000 simultaneous phone calls so that we could use the bandwidth. So if you're in a startup, you'll do anything to make sure the thing works. And so he did. And I apologize if any of you were on a Skype call at the end. Okay, and then I'll tell you about my trip to China. The first time I went was about 30 years ago. And I was with my dad and he was the chairman of the UN Development Program. And so we were kind of on a UN mission. But at that time, we arrived in the airport in Beijing and we drove in the only car on the only paved road to the only international hotel as defined as bathrooms where the toilet I can recognize. And everybody was there and they were selling fruit and vegetables and whatever else to each other. And everybody was on bicycles. All everything moved by bicycle. And it was fascinating. And so Flashword about 15 years, it's 1998-99, when I thought I had heard somebody had built a $90 million chocolate company in China. And I said, well gee, maybe I should go check that out. And so I went this time to Shanghai. And from Shanghai to Hanjo was about a three-hour drive. So I was driving from to Hanjo. Looking out the window, it's very boring. It's all the same thing. Two-story concrete tiled-ups. Everybody lived in two-story concrete tiled-up. Then all of a sudden, there was one with a spire and a driveway and a beautiful blue windows. And I thought, oh, that's interesting. And then we went a little further and there was another one. A spire, driveway, blue windows. A spire, driveway, blue windows. And then I saw three together with the driveways all connected and blue windows all the way across. And I thought, whoa, that blue windows salesman is going to make a fortune. And then the second thing I thought was, oh my gosh, it's just like the 50s here where I was keeping up with the Joneses. If Jones had a refrigerator, you had to have a refrigerator. If he had an oven, you had to have an oven. If he had a cell phone, you had a cell phone came later. So I thought, wow, this is a really interesting opportunity. And so I met with a big, some big finance minister in China. And I said, he said, we want you to invest all your money in China. And I said, oh, I never invest in China. And I was a little bit trying to provoke him. And he said, well, why not? He said, because this guy who built the $90 million chocolate company here got nationalized. You guys just took it from him. If you want people to invest here, they have to make a lot of money. And they have to be able to repatriate that money, bring it back to their country. And if they see one or two people making a lot of money by repatriating, it'll be Katie Bartheadore. People will be lining up to invest in China. And I couldn't tell whether the translator had said it right or anything. And whether he, and he kind of nodded, but I wasn't quite sure. But I think he was really listening because somehow, that's exactly what ended up happening. A lot of money went into China. And we started to make investments in China. And our first ones, we thought, oh, we're going to China. Well, it's a new country. And so we started giving money to people. And really, literally, this was giving money. To people who investing. To people who said, I have great government connections. Okay, you guys would have known. We lost all our money in all those companies. But we started to think, well, what about what do we normally do? Well, we invest in these driven, dynamic, interesting entrepreneurs who make great things happen. So we started to do that. And just with small, small amounts of money. And from there, we got Baidu, which is the search engine for China, and focus media, which is like the clear channel for China. And Yee-Pay, which is like the PayPal for China. And we had sort of an open field. And we had quite a run of it. The reason I put Singapore up here is this is the model government. You look at that skyline. And you know that that government has let builders go. He has, they have let people do pretty much what they wanted. And they have built a spectacular skyline. My daughter came to Singapore and she said, wow, it's just like the Jetsons. Jetsons was a little cartoon. And these guys were actually also Singapore government. They're kind of a corporate government. And they were the first guys to put money into our funds that were international. For that, I think. Russia is kind of the opposite. We've had four false starts in Russia. Or three false starts and now we're trying for another one. Okay, the false starts were, okay, they committed $100 million to a Russian fund that we were going to run. And they were all set to go. And just before they wrote the check, and this was a group inside Russia that was well respected. Just before I wrote the check, Kotor Kovsky got put into jail. And it turned out that that was all his money. And so it got frozen. And so that was our first false start. The second one we created a new fund. And the fund, and that was a smaller fund. And the local team there was a group that the LP, the investor chose. And we had to go with them. And they were all getting, they were investing a dollar and getting $0.0 back right away from whoever they invested the dollar with. So I don't think it was a particularly good model. But there were a few good companies that came out of that. And we were kind of thinking, I want to help this Russian group. So the last time I went to Russia, by the way, don't go in January. I walked outside and the all of the, every piece of heat left my body within three seconds out the top of my head and it was just gone. And I felt like I was in just a totally frozen body. So we started this great fund. I went to visit Russia and I went to the Hermitage Museum. I went to St. Petersburg. Moscow is one thing. It's sort of like a big facade and everything else is porous, sort. But St. Petersburg is a spectacular city. And it is so gorgeous. And you can imagine that in 1800 that it was so cool and so amazing. And I went into the Hermitage Museum and they've got the greatest collection of van goes and ren wars and whatever. In the world, this makes the Louvre look like Po-Doc. But the floors dirty, the walls are graffiti. The whole place is a total mess. And what happened, I asked, I said, what happened here? They say, well, 75 years ago, the Bolsheviks came in. And they were mad at the wealthy Russians. And this is happening in our country now. They came in and they made business illegal. And let this be a lesson to all of us. They made business illegal for 75 years. So imagine this, you're an entrepreneur. Your father believes business is bad. Your grandfather believes business is bad. And his father also believes business is bad and illegal. You have no role model. That is a horrible place to be. And if you have that entrepreneurial vibe, you don't even know how a free market works. It is a scary place to be. Anyway, so I'm hoping that if we keep at it long enough, a generation will go by where at least the father and mother will have understood the free market before these kids start businesses. But boy, there is some great technology coming out of Russia. I met with a president of Ukraine. And he again said, oh, we want you to invest in our country. And I said, I'd never invest in your country. And he said, what do you mean? He was very proud of himself because he made it. So I was the first person to set foot in Ukraine without a visa. They made it so that we could go to Ukraine freely without a visa. Which is a great idea. Get rid of all those borders. Anyway, I said, I'd never invest in Ukraine doing the same sort of thing. And he goes, why not? It takes 23 bureaucrats and six months before you can even incorporate a company here. And he said, that will be one bureaucrat one week. It never really happened. And he got thrown out of office. But he was quite revolutionary. He led the orange revolution. And the orange revolution was won by text messaging. And he was able to keep the pressure on the capital 24-7 by having people keep the supply chain going through instant messaging. And the supply chain was things like, get more flowers to the pretty girls in the front row so that they can't front line so that they can put the flowers inside the guns that the guards are holding. And get pizza to section A3. They're running low on food and get beer over here. He needs more beer because he's he's shouts much louder when he's got beer. So they did it all with text messaging. And so it, okay, I started to think, oh, interesting. Governments are going to change. And then Egypt and Tunisia fell because of Facebook and Twitter. We have this power, the social networking power. Geographic borders are going to fall. We are going to be, it's going to be easier to move from country to country to country. And these guys who are sort of at the top, power hungry, whatever, are going to be overthrown. And the best governments are going to rise. And so we've got a new system now. It's competitive governance. The guy who was the king who said, you know, who basically was on the by side now has to turn around and he has to be on the cell side and say, come to my country. I want you in my country. And for entrepreneurs and venture capitalists and money and corporations, they are in great demand in countries all over the world. And hopefully the US will follow suit and compete. Currently, they've been dropping. You know, the US used to be number one, bar none. Number one country you do business in. And now they're number four and it seems to be dropping. And this is one of the reasons. You guys get to see this. It's definitely worth looking at. Okay, we have, we have what Dr. Seuss created this great book. It's called, or I think it's inside one of the other books. But it's the B and the B watcher. And see, the B goes around and he works really hard. And then there's the B watcher who wants to find out how that B has been so productive. And so he sits and he watches the B. And then he reports back and they don't quite believe the B watcher. And so they bring in the B watcher watcher. And so the B watcher watcher is watching the B watcher watch the B. And then it gets, you know, of course, Dr. Seuss. It gets completely out of control. And there's the B watcher watcher and watch the B watching watcher watcher watcher watcher. But the whole idea there is we have the B's. We are the B's. And we don't need as many B watchers. You have too many B watchers. You start getting signals like that. And right now, the US government has gone from 8% where it was 8% overhead, which is, you know, reasonable. One out of 12 people is a B watcher. To now, it's 45% overhead. And overhead is defined. So it's like one B watcher for every B. And it's a little like, it's a bad trend. And I think it's systemic and we got a big problem. So see what you can do about that, guys. So here's my slide on competitive governance. You've got first on the lower right hand corner, you've got all those great countries that are now going to be a part of Arab Spring, which was that the overthrow of Egypt and Tunisia. Those countries are coming next. And then these are new countries. The one on the left down, lower left is called C land. And the one upper right is called blue seed. C land is actually functioning as a country, not yet recognized by the UN. Blue seed is going to be a country that's a big boat, 11 miles off the shore of San Francisco. And they're going to bring all the programmers from all over the world to that location so that then, in effect, they get sort of a visa or a green card. It's a different kind of green card. And then Bitcoin. Bitcoin is so cool. Who's heard of Bitcoin? Yeah, about a third. It's so cool. It's a new currency. And there's no government attached to it. It's the most valuable currency now on the planet because it is under no one's control. It is out of people's control. It is no longer regulated by any government. They can't print more Bitcoin. So this is actually very interesting. And there are a lot of interesting companies, CoinLab and Coinbase, I guess, who have started businesses around Bitcoin. Now we're going to change the perspective of what I'm going to talk about. We're going to be focusing here on change. This is Moore's Law. It says that $1,000 worth of compute power doubles every 18 months. Now what that means to me is, and now it's accelerating, so it's like every 14 months. What that means to me is every 14 months, there's a new platform that's twice as powerful as the one before. And for you as entrepreneurs, you should be looking at that and going, yeah, so we can make everything more productive. We can make everything easier. We can improve everything through just Moore's Law. In fact, if you had an iPhone 3 and an iPhone 4 and a 4S and a 5, you would feel and realize that each one was twice as powerful as the one before. The iPhone 5 is unbelievably powerful. And that six will be even more powerful. This doubling is creating huge opportunities. So the things I could do on the iPhone 3 are nothing compared to what I can do on the iPhone 5. This is another chart that you know, start thinking about the future. This is, you know, a politician would never, never quote anything from this. Energy is falling in price at an extraordinary rate. So from 78 to today, energy has gone from $5 a kilowatt hour to $0.20 a kilowatt hour. And it continues to fall. And this is really interesting because as that happens, you should be starting to think about businesses that actually use a lot of energy. Change is happening faster and faster. We all know that. But as an entrepreneur, I want you to look at it this way. Last 150 years, what have we had in the last 150 years? What's happened over the last 150 years that have changed our lives? The light bulb, indoor plumbing, radio, automotive, television, airplanes, the pill, the bomb, microwave, semiconductors, satellites, photocopier, space travel, computers, email, fiber optics, biotech, cell phones, x-rays, internet, digital cameras, web browsers, search engines, smart phones. Now with that acceleration, with that Moore's law, that same amount of change, human change is going to happen over the next 15 years. So imagine what could possibly happen over the next 15 years. We could have a near infinite energy supply, a desalinated water, water that's easy flowing. Self-navigating electric cars. Maybe they'll fly. Interactive education. You won't have to sit in these chairs. You can be much more comfortable. You can just watch me on some little screen. Of course, then you can't give me quite as hard of time. Design genomics are cures for cancer, AIDS, malaria, non-invasive surgery. This makes me think of non-invasive security. When you go through those metal detectors, you know, at the airport, well, we invested in a company that has changed all that, and when you go through those things that look like metal detectors, they're seeing you behind the little screen. They're seeing you completely naked. And when we invested in that company, we thought, wow, there are a lot of applications for this. Near-thought communications. Controllers. Okay, I don't think it's really working. But it will. And food drop. I thought, when I was a kid, I'd run around, and I never really wanted to stop, because there's so much to explore, and there's so much to do. And I always felt like getting food was always such a hassle. So I always felt like you should get something that said, food drop. And the food would drop in your hands. We're getting there, you know, if you combine like Uber cab with pizza delivery with, oh, I have, okay, we'll get to the next slide, and I have another really fun thing. It's two years after that, we're going to have even more change. So as an entrepreneur, you better be imagining things that are way out there. Otherwise, it's probably not going to happen. So need anticipation. Here's what I'm guessing. You know, these body bugs, if you guys see the body bugs and the fit bits and the whole works. Yeah. Okay, so those are determining things like, you know, what's your blood glucose level? So you could have those, and they could immediately alert some food delivery guy that your blood sugar level is low, and you need more potassium, and you need more calcium. And so milk, a banana, and a pizza show up, and you can just keep going. And then of course, star trek with a transporter. We're almost transporting now. Have you noticed that? I can feel like I'm in an entirely not another place by using Skype or video conference or whatever. We're going to have, I think, in medicine, we're going to have human rebalancing. I think people are going to, this is my friend, Kri Edwards, has a theory on that we're all energy sources and uses. And I think you could be rebalanced. And so when things aren't quite right with you, you just rebalance. And I guess that's what meditation is about. But you can kind of go beyond that. And then, Martian colonies, Elon Musk is trying to get us to Mars, right? And then this is my favorite of all time. Human animal communications. You know why this is really cool? I started, I've been listening to birds for some reason. And they go, tweed, tweed, tweed, tweed, tweed, tweed. What if you took each tweet and thought of that as a bird sentence? And you take them apart. And you guys, there's some electrical engineering here, right? There's take that apart and look at it as a signal-to-noise ratio. And figure out what signals those birds are sending when somebody comes in or when they're all flying in harmony or whatever else. So I think that's a fun thing to think about. This is how fast viral marketing has exploded. But I want to, I brought up this chart because this was how fast hotmail grew and that was the biggest, the fastest growing consumer product in the history of the world. And then Skype was much faster. Hmm, interesting. Things are spreading faster around the world. Okay, we have a new company. Okay, it's called Bang with Friends. And it is exploding. It is at a half a million users in a week. Viral marketing is amazing. It's amazing what you can do. So I want you to put on good marketing hats here. This is crowdsourcing and I want to talk just really about, everybody knows about Kickstarter and Uber and Pinterest and Box and TASRABET. But down here, this is the coolest thing. One of these entrepreneurs I funded came up with a watch and the watch had email on it. And I thought, wow, that's really cool. You know, email on your watch. And the guy who is great. And I thought, wow, you know, I really, you know, it's hardware, but I think I'll take a chance on this guy. So I gave him a little money and then it looked like, in many cases, we do lose everything. And it looked like we lost everything. And, you know, he was sort of coming back for money and didn't quite know exactly what. And then he put the thing, he said, well, let's do a video for Kickstarter. Why not? Sort of, it was like a Hail Mary pass. And he did this video for Kickstarter and they got $10 million. From Kickstarter. And 5 million of that was pre-orders for his watch. And the other 5 million was just money. They just liked the video. That is so incredibly powerful. So watch for crowdsourcing and funding. Now, I like to think, well, what happens next? And what's happening with viral marketing, with things spreading, with crowdsourcing? Is that distribution is becoming a commodity. And the reason I know is I was watching TV and I was trying to do a pay-per-view. And they said, pay-per-view, which service would you like to use? Amazon, Netflix. There were six or seven of these things. And I thought, wow, distribution is commoditizing. Those guys are all competing to send me my pay-per-view. So if the distributions commoditizing, then technological breakthroughs are going to spread around the world faster than they ever did before. So what that means to you as a potential entrepreneur is you better be thinking not just a couple years ahead or the next step. You better be thinking the next step and then what's the next step beyond that and then what's the crazy step beyond that? If you're in the crazy step area, you've got a good shot at success. If you're in the next step area, you will not... Well, it will be very difficult for you to succeed. So when you go through this process, you better step back and you better think, before I dive in here, it has to be more than good idea. It has to be good idea that we'll take advantage of the trend that may be happening not even now, but three or four years from now. Because otherwise, you're competing with big, huge companies that have many more resources than you do. Venture capital is changing. So because of this, I have to change my own business. I have to figure out what to do. I don't know what to do. It's not going to be the same as it was before. We've got crowdsourcing and we've got crowdfunding and we've got angels and we've got incubators and it's a whole different game than it used to be. So I have to start thinking, what's next, but what's next after next after next? Here's what I look for for an entrepreneur. I'm looking for somebody who breaks down walls. These companies like the Post Office was broken. All these things I thought would be here forever. I thought the Post Office, Mobbell, Trade, the neighborhood would all be exactly the way they were when I was growing up. I didn't think things changed. And then all of a sudden, hot milk blew out the Post Office. You don't have to write letters and lick the stamps. You guys probably haven't even done that in your life. And don't because it's like poison. Telecom business got turned on its ear because of Skype. All trade has changed because of eBay. The neighborhood has changed because of Facebook. I asked my son when he was about 12 years old. They said, why don't you go out there and play with your friends. And he goes, I am dad. And he was sitting there looking at his Facebook page. And then research advertising, libraries, whatever. Google has just kind of blown all those things out. So when you go after something, make sure you go after something very big as an iconoclast. Go after something big. So I'll give you a few examples of things you might want to go after. Venture capital. Investment banking. Wherever there's sort of a monopoly, go after that. Go blow it up. Medicine. Medicine. There are like, I don't know, 10 big drug companies. They control all the drugs all throughout the world, except for the ones that you've been trading. He had his head down so he doesn't know I pointed out. And so look at areas where there's a big monopoly and see if you can blow it up. Government. Government is one big, frothy, sloppy, oozing monopoly. And it needs to be cut and better, more efficient. And people need to go out there and become part of the free market and not just sit there and go. I'm sorry, I don't like the color of your curtains, which is what they do to me when I'm building a new school. Clever business models. Look for zeros in your business model. Amazon figured out how to get a zero accounts receivable in zero inventory. They had the biggest bookstore in the world, never held a book. That was huge. That changed the whole nature of a balance sheet and an income statement. Look for these, I look for these things. I look for these crazy, whoa, where did that come from? The blacks one. So those are the three things I look for. In disruptions, we funded some very interesting things, but the one I'll point out is SpaceX, because SpaceX did take on the government. They nasa to launch a certain payload into space. It cost $300 million in real dollars and $3 billion, including all the overhead. SpaceX was able to do that for $30 million. So 1-100th of what it was costing NASA. So NASA then subbed out and said, oh, this makes a lot of sense. Let's just go with SpaceX. Yeah, cool, huh? Now I'm going to tell you about Draper University of Heroes, because it's really fun. And we actually have a few people who went in the audience. I thought there's something wrong in education. And I didn't quite know what. And I looked and I said, you know, it's the A. The A means don't make any mistakes. I think the world needs more mistakes. I think penicillin was a mistake. Velcro was a mistake. Facebook was a mistake. These were all mistakes. These were the extraordinary thing happening because people were willing to fail. They were willing to try and fail. So I don't recommend necessarily going out there and just failing all your classes. But I do want you to, when you read this stuff, when you do it, think. And then try stuff. So at Draper University, we decided we were going to be all feel. Very little thinking goes on at Draper University. It's all feel. So you do things. We do lots and lots of things. It's a little bit business school, a little bit engineering up much. And a lot of fun. And we graduate everybody with a degree of change agent. And the way we get them thinking change, you live there. The way we get them thinking change is, from day one, when we play volleyball, I say, okay, we're going to all play volleyball. And then I give a ball to each team. And I say, okay, serve. And they, so both balls are in the air at the same time. And so then I say, if some team wins three points in a row, you can start a new rule that everybody has to follow. So they're hopping on one foot, speaking in Spanish. They're doing it left handed, whatever. And it gets people's imagination going. So we change the rules of monopoly, the rules of risk, we're nuclear risk. We change the rules of baseball. Can you imagine an American being willing to change the rules of baseball? Anyway, we gave it a shot. And then we have, they learn cooking and and rifling and yoga and painting and Audrey, what else do you learn? Go karting karaoke, she has a voice. It is unbelievable. Gorgeous voice. Maybe we'll get you up here to sing with me. You want to do that? And anyway, it's great fun. It's eight weeks. You can take a quarter off from Stanford. Tino will give you eight units of A. And you can come and you'll, we have survival training, both urban and rural. And we don't like to tell you too much about the survival training because there's some interest and surprises you'll run into. And then we teach things like viral marketing rather than marketing 101. And we teach finance as a simulation. So and the people who come and teach are people who have done great things in the past. So Tony Shavs' Apo's came in and spoke on corporate culture and Cri Edwards spoke on energy. And Elon Musk spoke on, we asked one of the students asked, Elon, so what one piece of advice would you give to an entrepreneur? And he said, don't do it. Because you know, the guy's got two companies and he's in the center of all that activity. And anyway, I thought that was a great answer because it sends you a message that if you are going to be an entrepreneur, it has to come from here. It has to come from your heart, your lungs, your feet. It can't come from your brain. So we've, it's great fun and how are we on time? Nine minutes is that include my Q&A? Oh, it does. Okay, so I won't go into what that looks like. But remember, wherever you go, whatever you do, entrepreneurs are heroes. They take long odds at extraordinary outcomes. They do, they change the world in ways that make our lives so much easier, so much better. And they'll help us rebuild the economy and make our lives better. And so if you are an entrepreneur, you are my hero. And if you want to support an entrepreneur, I would recommend it very highly. And since entrepreneurs are really my hero, what do you do for your hero? You sing to them. Hit it. There we go. Okay, for the world you sing along because I'm really not a good singer. for his music Get him to some of your cash, though. He's a twisted sweat, and I'd be home. For 15 years he's been out here. Bankers demanding blood refund. How could he serve the poor one? Even great. We'll not run. He is the least bastard. He is the fastest, fastest, fastest. He's the least bastard. He is the least bastard. He's got a mission, a competition, an artist's ambition, a competition's ambition. Fearless and free, and boring. No guarantee for the corporate escape. Seem fights on a kiss the trim, and a way off his best friend. Call the recession, seems like depression. Chapter 7 is the same. Then it says we're shouts, we got it. Company's gonna show up. Think the papers ran at the way side. The sky is open, astro-analytic. He is the least bastard. He is fast, fastest. He is the least bastard. He is the least versus. He is his best. He is fast, rough, faster. He's the least bastard. He's a top of the world and let me see it, vision unfurl. Cash flow landslide, and everyone wants to be his high. Pressors imply, or once they try. Anyone that is rich must apply. and, what you all have left me in. Cover my tail. LAUGHTER Mr. scratches master! is best, the best best in the world. It's based on the edge of the best in the world.
