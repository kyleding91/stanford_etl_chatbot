 Who you are defines how you build. This is the Auditorial Thought Leader series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. Welcome everybody to the entrepreneurial Thought Leader seminar at Stanford. Welcome YouTube community. It is great to have you as well as the extended Stanford community. I am Ravi Balani, a lecturer in the Management Science and Engineering Department at Stanford and the Director of Alchemist and Accelerator for Enterprise startups. And we are so honored to bring you the entrepreneurial Thought Leader seminar which is brought to you by STVP, the Stanford Engineering Entrepreneurship Center and BASIS, the Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students. This is the first time in two and a half years that we are back in this auditorium. I think it was in March of 2020 that we were here last maybe or even earlier than that. And it is so fitting that we are commemorating this shift to something new with a self-identified non-conformist, Marev Orin. So I'm thrilled to have Marev Orin, the CEO of Versatile here with us, to kick off this new ETL, Marev loves change and this is one of the most momentous changes that we've had in the last two and a half years. Marev is the CEO and one of four co-founders of Versatile which aims to turn construction into a fully controllable manufacturing process and make rapid data-driven decisions that support job site productivity and safety. And Marev is going to tell you more about Versatile in a moment. Hailing from Israel, Marev is another example of amazing Israeli talent that the US has been a beneficiary of. And when she was growing up in Israel, she grew up with a strong interest in construction nurtured by her father who is a general contractor and she advocates for the construction industry which many may consider to be unsexy, but she calls construction innovative, forward-thinking, and worthy of the world's leading technology investments. She's a triple-degree holder with a bachelor's in economics and management, a master's in law, and an executive MBA. And if that's not enough, she's also a former lieutenant in the Israeli Air Force. Marev spent 10 years in Israel at Intel where she spearheaded bizzops and financial services and led international projects with multicultural teams. And then in 2011, she started her entrepreneurial journey leading several nonprofits and then sort of a precursor to Versatile, another construction company. And then ultimately in 2016, she co-founded Versatile. Versatile has gone on to raise over $100 million in funding from funds like Tiger Global and Insight Partners. And also, Versatile became the first construction technology firm that was named a technology pioneer by the World Economic Forum. So without further ado, please join me in welcoming Marev to ETL. So Marev, I know there's so much that we want to talk about. But before we do, can you just describe to people what Versatile is or just give an introductory quick introduction? Yeah, Gladion. I'm so excited to be here. I shouted it out to like two and a half years of not being in person. Yes. Oh my God. So truly honored and thank you everyone for joining us. I'll make your time worthwhile, I promise that. And yeah, if I had to introduce Versatile and I'd just a couple of words, I'll start with what we stand for. It's allowing people access to information at the end of the day. I'd like to say to my team, we empower superintendents that happen to be the ones that build our world, everything around us. This building is relatively new, I believe. So someone was here building it, fairly not too long ago, allowing them to control over their own processes in ways that they never thought was possible before. And it's showing what we do. We do that through collecting a lot of data points in a very structured and repeatable way that allows us to truly tell the story of the job site and feed it back to our users in a way that they can act upon. So that's generally it in a nutshell, I'll say. I'll say a word about the gap of the industry, I perceive as the gap of the industry. We don't know how long things really take, like we don't measure. If you don't measure, you can't really improve, can you? So I view Versatile almost as actuals on planned versus actuals, which is pretty much the basis of any improvement that I could think of. That kind of like what our solution looks like, and with that I'll be done talking about Versatile other than the journey itself, which we'll bring it up a bit again. This is what the data looks like. If you want to make your users the center of your attention, if you want to know that you've hit home in making things really simple for the people that you serve. We make everything very easy to read, highly digestible, if I like to call it. We use the crane as a way to get the data out of job sites. It just happens to be that that's our first product and it serves that purpose of being deliberate in how we serve the construction industry. But it allows us to collect thousands of data points again and again and again. Actually that story handed over to superintendents at 5 a.m. every morning and those kind of like screens that you see just behind me. And then honestly, watch them. Shave off hours, days and weeks from their schedule. Assume control over time, which is generally an unsafe time of the day. Gain back, I don't know, five weeks we're talking March of 2020. Some of our customers have gone into shelter in place just to gain that time back by controlling their process. So that's versatile in a nutshell. I guess. We've gone on to raise just a little bit of money. Well, so I'm going to kick it off with some questions. I'm going to turn it over to the students in about 15 to 20 minutes. So if you guys have questions, start thinking about them. Mayor, I want to start off with one of the hallmark intuitions that all founders either have to hone or develop is figuring out when to listen to advice and when to say no to advice and stick to your own convictions. Now I'm sure and I've heard that when you were starting off, you know, people were trying to dissuade you from doing construction technology. It's not exactly the sexiest industry to go into or an industry that people that's known for, you know, being the birthplace of great tech unicorns. So can you share your perspective on when you should say yes and listen to advice and when you should go in the opposite direction? That's a beautiful question and as you guys are kind of like at the earlier stages and I still remember, it wasn't that long ago that I was probably in your seat and I'll start by saying always listen to advice. The part that I kind of like have a slightly different approach towards is do you follow advice and is that just doing what you're told. So I'll say listen to advice and never do what you're told. And I think the best story is I guess I can share around that would be to your point, construction isn't the most kind of like attractive industry or it doesn't seem to be very attractive. I was told it's impossible. I was told that I couldn't raise money for an adventure like this. And I think probably probably the best story is we just got our pre-seed funding and I was getting a lot of advice from really smart people. These would be our first investors and they would constantly tell me what they think should be done. Now, probably being in Israeli as well. My tendency was to listen and filter and find my own path. And my own path is never do what they say. I'll say more than that. There were three partners and the beauty was to actually connect what they were saying and they never agreed. I don't think I ever heard the same advice from all three of them. So I would take that and I would find a fourth way, which would be the versatile way, which would be my way. And I'm probably on the streets of San Francisco and I get a call from one of those partners because like, wow, you don't listen. You just don't listen. I was like, on the contrary, I do. But I don't do what you tell me to do. By the way, you guys never agree, just so you know. And it was a defining moment, I think, in understanding that when people give you advice, they seem to think that you should just do what they told you to do. That is not advice. Advice is knowing to be in the backseat, to support, to tell you what I think, but always know that you know best. That's how I give advice today. If I mentor anyone, I was like, I'm not in your shoes and I'm not at a driver's seat. So I'm only going to tell you what worked for me or what I think. But that's it. Wow, an excellent advisor or a good mentor doesn't tell you what to do. So you always do your path. Oh my God, yes. You always create your own path. Even if it's a slight modification, that's like a religious rule for you. I think that is pattern matching with many great founders. Now, Meredith is sort of famous for asking for help and always getting it. And so I wanted to invite Meredith to spill her secrets. When you share what are the secrets to asking for help and getting help and what are the mistakes that you see other founders who ask for help and don't get it, why do they fail? Yeah, you're absolutely right. I literally get 99.9% of my requests, actually, delivered or fulfilled. 99.9% of things that you ask for people will follow up on and do. Yes. Okay, so share. Spill. Okay, so I'll start by saying everyone wants to help you. Like, even those advices that I was talking about, like people really want to help. The entrepreneurial community is incredible. There's so many people that have been on this journey before me and before you and they really want to help. The big problem is time. That's the one thing that we all don't have enough of. When I was just getting started, I had time. But whoever wants to help me doesn't necessarily have it. And I remember just being extremely accessible myself. I would go anywhere that the other person would be willing to meet me at. I'd literally be time zone agnostic. I would meet anywhere anytime. Anyone that would be willing to help me, I would just make myself. I remove all constraints. And I think that's a big part of it. What a part of it. I'll tell you a story. So I'm a storyteller. So I think people learn really well from stories. So this is me pretty much at the beginning of our journey. Mind you, everyone tells me that I'm probably wrong and this can't be done. I've heard a lot. But we've gone through mass challenge. I don't know if you've heard of the accelerator, but it's a great one. We're just graduated and we actually won. We won mass challenge and the CEO of mass challenge congratulated us. And I can't say I'm going to make it to Boston and then I'm going to ask for help. It's like anything you need. So I sent this email. And I thought I was completely over the top. Like it was a well-structured but relatively long email that said, hey, I've done the research. I'm coming to Boston. These are the dates. This is what I need. And here is why I need it. Here are the people. Here are the little snippet of what I would want you to forward to these people. And I would really love for you to do this for me. I was specific. I did the research. I want to say a word about doing the research. And I asked for very tangible things. I knew he had the connections and all I asked for is literally forward my email or forward the snippet to the person and I explained why. He delivered on all of those. And when I actually made it to Boston, he came out and he shook my hand. I was like, this is the best founder, like, help email I've ever received. I was like, I thought I was completely over the line. I'm like, no, because I really want to help. Most people will confuse me or will tell me, hey, please introduce me to investors. Do not do that. No one has the time to think for us. Who's the right investor for us? Who do they know? What is your business about? And why would that connection even make sense? So if I want to help, I need to know exactly what you're asking me to do. I were to say, hey, I'm not even fundraising yet, which is what I did at the time. But I want to understand what it would take to get their money. And here's my question. And here's my why. Then they would know what to say, yay or nay, to even the meeting itself. And if I don't have a product yet and I want to talk to customers, then again, I need to be very clear about the fact that what I'm asking for is to give them a glimpse of what the future looks like. I was kind of out there. I was like, they need to know what's coming. And that's what I have to offer in exchange for their time. And that worked like a charm. Today when I get emails and founders do contact me for help, I think that's the first thing I say. Be specific. Make it easy for me to help here. And if you make it that easy, then people will help. Be specific. Do your research. Show me that you know exactly why you're even asking for my help and for my time. And chances are that I will help just like everyone helped me earlier on in the journey. And hopefully we'll keep helping me after I spill all my secrets. Well, I think they will. And I think that's incredibly helpful and powerful. And on this idea of spilling secrets, can we talk a bit about vulnerability and leadership? Sometimes being a CEO can be a very lonely job, especially if you're doing something new and everybody's a naysayer. And you sort of have this, there's an instinct to try to show strength. And yet at the same time, some of the deepest, most powerful teams come through leaders exposing themselves in a vulnerable way. Can you speak to your philosophy about leading do you lead with vulnerability and if so, what's your philosophy and approach and experience with that? Yeah, I think it's a public question to my team. I always kind of, I think leaders can always do better. I do my best to learn and understand. But wow, so transparency and vulnerability are hardly ever spoken of or touched upon, right? I believe I do. I think there's a right and a wrong in transparency and it goes through understanding your audience. It's true for how you ask for help. I think it's like the way I personally operate. But if you take the same principles of understanding your audience, understanding what you're trying to give and what you're trying to receive, then using transparency in a way that allows people to understand your message and then on vulnerability. So I wouldn't say things like, here are the numbers, just figure it out. I'll say, here is what the numbers are telling us. Here's a story that I'm reading from these numbers. So I share the numbers, but not as a, okay, interface, just get it and hopefully you'll understand what they mean. I would usually use more of advanced tools of making sure people are along on the journey. Vulnerability, once again, I'll probably share a story and going back to, I guess, also where I started versatile and you mentioned my father. So yeah, I'm kind of like the black sheep of my own family because I went to Intel, but that is what you see and my brothers and project manager, I shouldn't have done that. So I should have been a superintendent. I came back to construction pretty much because of an accident on my brother's job site. He actually lost a worker that day and I kind of triggered the whole control over manufacturing, give the power to the superintendent. Everything that we do today is pretty much triggered from a year ago moment that day about can job sites be controlled? And my dad is probably one of my best advisors and I've moved here and haven't seen him for a while, and that makes it all. And he actually came to visit when we were raising our service B. And he came and he left pretty much like this was a very short fundraise. So I think he got here right about when we signed the term sheet and he left the day before we closed around and I announced around to our team internally the day after he left. And it's a moment of celebration. Everyone probably thinks that I'm super strong, speaking of vulnerability. And I chose to share and I guess I'm sharing here too, but I shared that this was actually really hard for me because my dad is firmly ill. He's a world-renowned man. This would potentially have been my last chance of saying goodbye and I was really busy closing around. The reason I'm sharing this and the reason I kind of realized that was, to me that was natural. I didn't think of it as vulnerability or that this was just me sharing something with my team. I'm very open. And one of my team members sent me an email after the all-hands saying, wow, I don't think you understood how incredibly powerful that moment was. And I didn't. But it made me think about vulnerability and about transparency and the things that you say and when you say it and how you show that you're actually human. So it's really hard to show that you're human because from everyone telling me that I cannot do this to raising over $109 million, a hundred of those were doing a pandemic to your point non-sexy industry. And by the way, guys, with a solution that actually is harder enabled fast after the service, like very unusual. I must be good, somewhat human and somewhat not. There is a computer somewhere. The ability to show that it's okay is incredibly powerful. And my team actually talked me that email and by the responses that I got later. We could just be super strong all the time and have everyone think that we're super human or we can say, yeah, we're doing things that no one else seems to have just cracked the code of just yet and we're probably cracking some codes. But we also have a life, we have a family, we go for things and we regret not having time or not being able to say goodbye. I think there's a lot to say to be said about that. Well, yeah, and I do think that when you humanize yourself, you give permission to everybody else and the team to be humans too and create some people hopefully creates the team coheres. I want to open it up for questions from the students. Hello. My name is Kasi. First, I want to thank you so much for your time. Recently, I was doing a bit of reflecting on achievements and for example, I think a lot of us Stanford is in a sense an achievement. And I remember before Stanford, I would look at Stanford students as like, like there was a distinct gap between myself and the Stanford student. But then once I got here, I realized that I'm still fundamentally the same person I am from before. So I just wanted to ask, is success, is there something that fundamentally changes you once you go through success or is success kind of like a hub? Like Stanford is that gathers people with innate born qualities in them. Wow. I view or at least my personal journey, I always say and I probably frustrate my team quite of it when I say that I always say that we're 2% done. I think from 2% done, it might be too early to call success, right? But I think the journey changes here. And different steps in the journey should change you for the better though. I do my best to learn. Definitely hope that I faith tuition well, we're in Stanford, right? So if you make a mistake, it's only about what you learned from it. If you learn well, then the tuition was well worth it. And you might be just one step closer to graduation. You can take a long on yet another class. I know I'm also a dropout, but we won't talk about that, right? You can share it, but that's great. My co-founder is thinking of success, right? So I do have three degrees, cool, I don't know. But then there's one that I dropped out on the last class. Because I was doing two degrees at the same time, two different universities working full time at Intel. I literally didn't know what train I was supposed to be on at any given time of the day. I was like, I'm just going to get back to that final class, maybe in a year or two. And I never did. But my co-founder always used to make fun of me. If I like, we could still say you're a dropout in Silicon Valley, that's probably a good thing. So, I think it'll fail you soon. But I don't think success should change you. I think it should be taken with humility and with an understanding that there's probably new things to learn. And if you've mastered one thing, I think I said that it wasn't very long between our series A and our series B, for example. And I remember saying, wow, I think I've got this. And then it's probably going to be so different next time I go out there than maybe I don't. Count your success for what it was and see if it would be an ex-learning. How I would look at that. But I'm probably changed in many ways. Hi, I'm Laura. Do you mention that you're one of the co-founders of your company? I just wanted to ask, how did you guys meet, what are your relationships like, the different areas of expertise, and what advice would you give in building a team to create a new startup for company? Building a team. Ask me again in a few years now. Again, constantly changing, right? And small teams versus big teams. Founders would be, A, I'm actually married to one of my co-founders. So that would be the longest relationship. And I always say that that's a huge advantage because you've been through so much together. You can know how to power through crises. The others was, I think, the longest interview process. So a lot of my co-founders was an introduction at a conference. And he always said that I had him at a low. I actually argued that he put me through the longest interview process sending me to, you know, he was VC friends and all that. I knew I needed someone to translate the crazy scientists. I might be the crazy business person to a product language. So this was kind of like how we connected. And then the fourth co-founder was a friend of the third co-founder and was just the right person at the right time. So I think founding teams and teams in general is a pointing time. It's like magic. And it changes. It changes over time and the relationships evolve. It's a tough journey. So it really puts a strain on any relationships. It's about knowing that something is right for you in the moment and allowing yourself to trust and to bond even if they weren't your best friends from kindergarten. Because I don't know many founding stories where everyone were like childhood friends. So there's a lot to be said about smaller or large founding teams. I find four to have been a really good number. It's like a stable four-legged table that you could put quite a lot of weight on it. Then over time it changes. You evolve when the company grows and it just really does change as the team grows. I generally look at startups as many projects. So the first two years and the second two years, if we could look at a company at a two-year intervals and just think of everything as a project and people should come together over the project and complete the task. And then we'll see what's next. And with that mentality, you can form super strong teams without overthinking what's next. Because you never know when a startup anyways. What's going to be next? It's an interesting one. So if a student is wrestling with whether or not somebody else should be considered a co-founder, they're taking the leap and joining with somebody else as a co-founder. Is there any guidance that you have about when you know that somebody is a good co-founder fit versus just a founding employee? What makes somebody cross that bar for you saying, check, this is my co-founder? Probably just at the time, if it's really early in the journey, it's not an employment relationship just yet. You really need someone or you yourself just want to be a part of something that is so raw. It hasn't even begun yet. And it takes so much building and so much willpower to create something out of nothing. It did not exist. Then that's a co-founder. And can you share, have there been any struggles in having this co-founder relationship? Because I'm sensing that over time. And are you able or willing to share any stories about the difficulties with co-founder relationships and how you can still have good fights as co-founders and stay connected? Just take it into a room and fight it out and walk out with a good disagreeing co-week sometimes. Would be it really? Disagreeing means we agree to disagree but we commit to the decision. Disagreeing means eventually a decision has to be made and if we couldn't agree then yes there's got to be one decision maker even in a founding team. There's got to be one decision maker, mainly CEO. Then you walk out of the room as if you agreed. Whatever happened in that room stayed in that room and everyone else perceives that decision as and it's true for leadership regardless of founding teams. The minute the decision has been made it's final and you have to stand behind it. So think of a leader that goes back to their team and says I didn't agree. I don't actually believe in this decision. Now let's go execute on it. I don't know, probably not going to work very well. If you say this is a decision, this is why we have to do this and sometimes it involves tough decisions like stop providing a service. Kill a feature. People have worked really hard on something and you might make a decision to stop it all together. You have to have that alignment. So yes, disagreeing committee would be one of the challenges not just in a founding team but in any kind of leadership relationship and it's hard. I'm not sure I have the code on that one. I can break the code on many things, probably this one not yet. But it sounds like one of your principles is that there is respect that each co-founder probably owns their own domain and they get to make decisions in that domain. But when there's conflict, everybody agrees that you or the CEO will make the decision even if they disagree they'll commit. Yes. And if you ever lose that, then it's time to separate. It's time to separate. It's definitely time. If you lose that, you'll separate. You cannot continue without that trust and without that domain and without that disagree to it. Other questions? Hi, I'm Amman. I heard your little anecdote on how you're at a stage where you weren't ready to raise money but you still wanted to speak to people and get a sense of how you might do that in the future even if that was an if, not so much as a commitment. We often treat conversations like that as transactional. But I come to you, I expect something out of you, but clearly those people didn't know whether your startup was going to build up to something that they could invest in. So how did you approach those conversations at the start and during the conversation itself? Conviction, more than anything else. So always be selling, always be clothing, but have your intent out there. So, so those early conversations where this is what I'm building, what will it take for you to fund us? And by the way, most of them said I'll never fund us, I can't all honestly. And they offered me great advice as to why I should not be doing that. I remember conversations with investors that said, I would invest in you. You seem like an incredible founder. Like you would go through walls to build what you believe in. But not this construction thing and this hard work thing or whatever, like once you pivot, come back. But having those conversations in a non-fund raising setting allows you to learn really fast, super fast, but you have to listen. And again, since I wasn't there to say I'm asking for your money and the framework was very clear, some of them became my mentors. And my advisors, too today, I did not take their money, but they're my best friends or my advisors. I think that's actually how we met. One investor that, yeah. Yeah, yeah, Jocelyn and Stanford alum. Mm-hm. So college serendipity and the way to open doors, but those conversations led to incredible things that you don't necessarily expect. Speaking of that, asking for help on that first email that I sent, I ended up in a conversation with a reporter on that trip. And he offered a stage in this really important construction industry event. And boy, was I not ready for that. So lots of prep, but I took the stage. I think I could date so much of our current customers and relationships on how we built the business, and how we built our trusted partnerships with our first customers to that moment of someone randomly accepting my request to talk and tell them what I was building. And I sparkly eyes that you have when you truly believe that you're building something that's going to change the world. And you don't care if no one else believes you. Now, everyone believes me. I'm just thinking of success. It's too easy. It's hard when no one does. And that's exactly where you should shine. Just go all the way. Don't do what you're told. Listen to advice. But don't do what you're told. And speak to investors that way. So another thing about fundraising I'm without spilling all my secrets. I think the moment between getting a ton of nose to getting so many yeses that got confusing, honestly, that's another problem. Then whatever it talks about what happens when you're over subscribed. And you actually have to turn it down. We can talk about that too. Turning down short term sheets. I don't want to talk about that. That's a good problem to have. It's a real problem. I think too many founders have the approach of, please give me money. I really want my dream to happen. And I want to partner with you. And I want to kind of like, I need your money. And I'll then build it. And my approach has always been. And I realized that later on, it's just in a natural way. I never really gave it any thought. But my approach would be, I'm building this incredible thing. And I'm going to build it with or without you. You have nothing. Like your response has nothing to do with it. And I'm offering this amazing opportunity. Take it. Leave it. It's going to be your loss if you kind of like didn't take it. And I will build. I will build whether without co-founders or build world or without investors. I will build whether without a team. Don't build without a team, by the way. It's just really hard. But that conviction that you know what you're doing, and you're going to build it, knowing that things will change. And it's not exactly going to be what you believe that would be. I think I said I'm going to start in New York. We never were like, we're not even in New York today. Like there's many things that have changed along the way. But I think I always had that confidence that I am building it. And that's how I approached investors if it was just for like, what does it take to get your money when the time is right? Terrific. Great answer. Robbie, I'm going to ask on behalf of the students tuning in online. Oh, please. Sorry. Thank you, Amanda. The most up-foded question on Zoom right now is how have you dealt with evolving roles? Mine or others? I think the CEO rolls the bulb as well. Similar to what I said about the two-year tenure, if you like. You have to look at things. And that's an advice I got, by the way. It's not originally mine. I wish I could give credit. I don't remember who told me that. But if you truly kind of like sign a contract for real, but in a mindset of, this is what we're going to do. This is the next milestone that we're going towards. Then the roles evolve naturally. And also kind of like where disagreements happen, you know that you have to separate almost naturally. And then as companies grow, I believe there are more opportunities. So coming from Intel, and even as an Air Force commander, if organizations are really big, you could move people around. You could say, OK, this is not the right role for you, but maybe something else. In a startup, you need to evolve or get off the bus and in the next stop. So I think it's still evolving. That's one of the hardest questions to answer. Because I think if you ask me the same question in five years, I'll probably give a different answer than what I would give today. But I just look at people, I look at the roles, and I would try to make it work, I guess. And do you ever feel in posture syndrome when you go into a new phase? When, and this is sort of dub killing off of the first question, if you began, if you were looking at series BCEOs, I don't know if you vaulted them on a pedestal and said they have something that I don't have, is your experience now that you actually had everything at day one that you needed? Or when you go into each new phase, are you feeling some type of imposter syndrome or a need to develop skills? And if so, how? Oh god, yeah, don't let that syndrome get the best of you. It's brutal and absolutely. I think everyone goes through this in one state or another where someone turns on the light and finds out. But yes, it's real. And it takes different shapes at different stages. But I'll say something about like series B founders or even like every time that I was at a certain kind of stage in the journey, I would look at the ones that have taken the path before me and I would seek their advice, speaking again of that advice. I aspire to talk to people that have done things that I haven't done. Because it's kind of boring having a conversation about the things that have already achieved. It's great. But then I'm the mentor instead of the mentee. And I take that role sometimes too. But I'm not intimidated by people that have taken their companies to steps and heights that I haven't just yet. So I think every time I try to find a next kind of like person to talk to that have done things that I haven't done yet. And I look back at like, oh wow, I did have people on a pedestal for the stages that I just marked down on. And that's the beauty of being told something is impossible. You look for those who have actually done that. I was like, I think imposter syndrome or not. Yeah, I can do it. I can do it too. So guys, if I can do it, then you can do it too. That's what I'll say. And always look for someone that has done the things that someone else tells you is impossible. And you might just get it right. I like to say that I enjoy the tick mark of done over tasks that were rendered impossible just like a minute before. Well, on that, I think I'm going to end, draw to the end, our first inaugural ETL in person in over two years. So everybody join me in thanking Merub.
