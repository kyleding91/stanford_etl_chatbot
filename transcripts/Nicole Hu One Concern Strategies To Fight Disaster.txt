 Who you are defines how you build. This is the OddPearL Thought Leaders Series. Brought to you by Stanford E Corner. On this episode we have Nicole Hu, co-founder and CTO of One Concern, a predictive artificial intelligence platform that aims to help communities prepare for and mitigate natural disasters. Here's Nicole. Stanford is not just special to me because I'm an alumni here, but also because we started One Concern right here four years ago. It was here where I met Tim and Ahmed, my co-founders, where we eventually became friends. And we became friends because we shared common values. If you go on through our demographics for the co-founders, we are very different. I'm an Asian woman, Ahmed's Muslim Indian, and Tim's Caucasian from the military. But we had fun at Stanford always talking about large problems and just really getting to know each other. One fine summer of 2014, Ahmed went back home to Kashmir. And if I'm not sure if you know about this, but Kashmir India had one of the largest floods that year, a flood which they hadn't seen in several decades. We tried very frantically to reach out to him. We would see the news talking about how many hundreds of people ended up losing their lives. And we couldn't reach out, we couldn't connect with him and it was very, very scary. Ultimately, we did end up connecting with him to figure out that his family and him were safe after the flood. However, when he came back to Stanford, he talked about so many stories related to the Kashmir flood. And it was pretty modifying. It was a disaster in all sense. There was complete chaos after the disaster. You would have no sense for the emergency rescue to figure out where they should actually go. Who should they actually rescue? You had thousands of people abandoned on the rooftops for several days. And you have hundreds of people either drowning or being washed away by the flood. And we wondered why is this still a problem? And why is in the 21st century, why is nobody thinking about it? And what can we do to help just being graduate students here? A little while later, we got the opportunity to work in a class project together. It was the machine learning project at Stanford, as well as the probabilistic earthquake engineering class at Stanford. And we took that opportunity to figure out, can we actually solve the problem we saw in the summer of 2014? And what can we do to reduce that chaos? The goal there was just, let's find a way to figure out what exactly the problem was. And the problem we tried to resolve was, can we provide a real time, granular understanding of which buildings and which people are in what state of collapse during a disaster? So that was a problem statement. Our backgrounds of computer science, structural engineering and earthquake engineering led to it being focused mostly on seismic initially. And we were very happy with the results. It was surprising because it wasn't done before. But there's a lot of physics and science already there, instructional and earthquake engineering. All we did was sort of understand the features present there. And really convert that in a more granular and real time solution. We're happy with the algorithm we created. But what we were more pleasantly surprised was that when we presented this algorithm in the CS29 machine learning process, a lot of professors came up to us, a lot of investors came up to us and said that what you have is applicable. And you can create a real product here. Now we were taking a little of that because we never thought of starting a company or of creating a product. And none of us had experience running a business before. Two thirds of us were immigrants, myself and my environment. And I'm not sure whether it's a similar thought process. But when you're immigrant, generally you come to Stanford. Your thought process is work hard, study hard, get good grades, and then find a reputable place to go to so that you can then give back to your family who sacrificed so much to just make sure that you come here. So when somebody came up to us and said, you should not think about the idea this way. And then think about what product could look like. It was a little hard for us because that meant that there is obviously going to be this associated with creating a company and we didn't have any background associated to that. So what we instead, there is we try to see whether what we're hearing from our professors and from from the investors is that really real. So we called call a bunch of different cities, a bunch of different emergency officials. And we asked them that hey, we are three graduate students here. We have this algorithm. We really don't know whether or not it will be helpful or not. Can we spend a few hours with you to just understand is this really a problem and can we can we do some impact here? And we are surprised that instead of them spending a few hours, they ended up spending several days with us. The hope and the excitement we saw in these city officials, I think that was the final push to make us say that we have to do this. It sort of came to light that it is a responsibility. And if we don't do it, will anybody else think about this problem or will this problem keep repeating itself? So then all the three of us, the three co founders, we had a really hard conversation, at least actually several hard conversations about what we would have to give up in terms of our previous ideas. And what does it mean to commit to a mission and what does it mean to commit to a company? Now, while I talked a little bit about my and Ahmed as immigrants, our problems, Tim himself was raising a family. So, you know, what would that mean in terms of his responsibilities? But at the end of those conversations, we said, you know, we are all in, you know, we have to do this. And once we once we figured out that this is the problem we want to solve, we then started thinking about the next step. The next step is, you know, parallely continuing our conversations on what the product would look like with the cities, but also figuring out that we cannot build a very complex machine learning pipeline for disasters with just the three of us. So building a team, building something actually feasible. So that meant trying to figure out what we want to actually do this on our own, raise money ourselves or start looking at investors. It was hard for us to pitch in money ourselves, you know, being immigrants and all. And so that meant that we did have to go through the investor out. Now, now that was a little surprising as well, because when we went to investors, we thought, you know, obviously these cities are so excited. You know, we heard about product market fit, you know, customers, you like it. So, you know, investors should definitely jump on this idea and you help us through. But that wasn't what we saw. For around nine months, we mostly heard rejections. And it's very hard to hear that because along with the risk you're taking, you hear somebody really experienced with a lot of expertise in building a business coming to you and say, saying, you know, you have a noble idea, but it's just an idea and you need to give it up. I have an anecdote of a particular investor, which we were really, you know, we really respected and that was one of the meetings, which I still remember. We went into the meeting, we gave our pitch deck and the investor said, you know, if an earthquake happens, I'm just going to walk out and go to my neighbor's house. This is such a silly idea. You should start thinking about something else completely and you wasted so much time. So, nine months of not just hearing rejections, nine months of not knowing, you're basically collecting debt. And then nine months of real or big fear from your visa process, you know, what's going to happen? Can I still stay here? Do I have to go back to India? It was pretty scary for us. But instead of having that bring us down, what we did was we took a step back and he said, you know, what are we not doing right? We didn't blame the investors or the feedback. We realized that there's something missing in what we are doing, which is why we couldn't portray our story to the investors were talking to us. And so we later realized that the problem was twofold. One problem was we weren't talking to the right set of investors. You know, they are different investors with different investment thesis. So there are few in the seed stage who definitely want to look at evidence in the market, you know, put a strong ratio or wait on that as part of investment in your company. And given that there was no earthquake, govdeck, product out there, you know, just really high risk. Whereas there were other investors who put a lot of weight on the team, is there a need, you know, and that the team is going to figure it out. Like really large focus there. So we realized that we need to start looking at, you know, these investors. The second thing we realized was the what was missing in our pitch was we always talked about the vision, but very little about the feasibility of the business. And we knowing that we didn't know that too much, we took whatever help we could get. We went to Stanford, Venture Studio, talking to all the Stanford graduate students there, pitching several hundreds of times and just brainstorming about what could be wrong. We talked to investors for advice, even the people who rejected us, and dealing with what could we have done better, what is actually the problem. And we, we enmercimated all that information in and, and, and, or go eventually finding the right investor and, and helping them understand exactly the perspective of why this idea should be present was what founded one concern. So first, forward today, we grew from the team of three to a team of 80 and our mission is for a world of resilience, where we see resilience in the three pillars of safety, equity and sustainability. And the, we obviously expanded from seismic to floods and fires. And to talk about what the issue in seismic is, when an earthquake happens right now, what, what, what is in the hands of emergency responders. There's two things you might get. One is a map where in entire neighborhoods or cities are colored, colored a single color, you know, red, yellow, green, telling them that that is the impact for a city. The second thing is you probably seen it on Google. It's a shake map. You see really large red concentric circles on the map. And that's sort of what a responder is supposed to take in and, and do those life saving decisions. So when you think about why the chaos follows after, it's obvious, you know, just looking at a blurry map, how can a first responder know what to do in when, when several thousands of people need help. So we moved from that idea into the idea on the left, really focusing on going really granular on a block by block level and even building level, helping people understand which, which buildings are in what sort of collapse minutes after the earthquake happens. We not just do a building level information. We understand, understood that the people components were important. So who resides in those buildings? Are they low income? Are they senior population? Are they children? Because the resources you spent you send during a disaster are very different based on the vulnerable population who are affected. Hurricane Katrina is an example wherein most of the, there were a lot of senior citizens who were abandoned and they needed an influx of blankets because they were shivering during the hurricane. But no one knew exactly what was the ratio of people who are affected. So that's the second component we focus on in a, in a product. And finally, the third component is we don't want to just predict which buildings are down. All we want to help cities understand is which, what is the state of the city. So that implies not just looking at direct causes of impact, but also looking at secondary and tertiary causes of impact. So is your power sector down? Is your health care down? Is your water system down? And how does that ultimately go and affect citizens? The given example, you might have the strongest hospital in the world, which might be up during the big one, during a big earthquake. But if the headchurchy system is down or if the power system is down and there's no sort of backup plan, it still means that your health care is affected. It still means that citizens aren't getting that rescue. So how do you portray a cascading effect of dependencies along with the impact map to your first responders? Flood, we just released last November. And we chose floods specifically because it has a larger impact. And it's, it is definitely the impetus of one concern, the Kashmir flood. It's more or less similar to what we do in seismic. The only difference is that you could actually forecast five days into the future. Now, when hurricane, how are we happening or any hurricane happens? What data these cities understand is a storm is coming. It's going to come in three days. You're going to get five inches of rainfall. But how does that help you know who to evacuate? And how does, how does it help you know who's going to end up drowning in that particular incident? So it's a broad providing that really granular impact and updating your accuracy as and when you get real time input from on the ground. We are very transparent about how accurate or an authoritative models are. In fact, that's what cities love. They want to know how can they help us make our models even more accurate. We want them to be able to make those decisions after understanding where our models wouldn't work and where our models will work. And the final third component, which is still in development is fires. Fires are very close to California. The costliest disaster of last year was the wildfire in California. Now, the issue of impact knowledge and situational awareness is even is probably larger or equal to that of floods and fires. Our floods and earthquakes. You have fires moving at 80 miles per hour, literally engulfing football, fused in seconds. And meanwhile, the only data which is coming in is 911 calls or a reconnaissance where you're driving around the neighborhood. How does that help you really understand what the state of impact is? And how does that help first responders or firefighters really evacuate ahead of time? And so that's sort of different offerings. And we moved to not just doing response. We understood that it's not just about during the response helping save a few lives. It's definitely about how do we prevent the loss in the first place? We work with cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles and Muld and get also in the midst of deployment internationally. Wherein, wherein, what we do is help them do more efficient planning. How do you prevent this loss in the first place? One is just through looking at multiple different scenarios. Seeing is your emergency response system actually capable of responding to it? Do I need to increase my budgets? Do I need to add more resources? Do I need to communicate better? So that's what we call a scenario planning. But the second thing is about reducing the loss in the first place. So that's through by the city planning, that's through better infrastructure adjustments. Just trying to figure out even addition of that HHG water pipe which would have caused a lot of chaos to the health care in California. So how do you really prioritize among all those decisions? And we're doing this not just for governments. We are expanding and helping people work together in a resilience ecosystem. We get in different commercial sectors and governments talking the exact same picture. During a large event, most of the small medium businesses will absolutely go bankrupt. So how do you have people understand that this is the state of what disaster risk is and how do I prepare for it ahead of time? So what we do here is we call this benevolent intelligence wherein we really want to use artificial intelligence for social good. And we really think that we can enable a disaster-free future. And what do I mean by disaster-free? I mean that hazards will keep happening. You'll have seismic events, you'll have floods, you'll have fires. But cities and citizens will be able to immediately bounce back. And that bouncing back would happen because of immediate response during a disaster through better planning before a disaster. And even through better infrastructure updates. And it wasn't. So that's one concern. And we come here, like I said, we've grown pretty large, but it wasn't very easy coming to where we are. There definitely a lot of challenges we had to face. So the two different challenges I'd like to focus on is number one is surround yourself with the right people. It's always going to be about the people. You have the right people. I think 75% is already half done. And what do I mean by people? I mean by obviously the the team the people you hire. You know, we've been lucky. We've hired not just diverse thought processes, but like diverse in terms of age, gender, race, etc. But also in terms of thought process. We have firefighters, we have emergency managers, we have mayors, we have data scientists, we have a collection of a lot of different thought processes which enable us to understand how can we fix this through policy and technology. And make sure definitely that the bar you'd keep for your mission alignment is as high or maybe even higher than the technical bar or the business bar you're looking for. Don't compromise on that. We've learned that the hard way that we should never do that. I give you a quick anecdote of an interview we did in the early stages of one concern. We had this really, really smart engineer come to interview with us. I'm really impressed by what he could do. So I interviewed him and one of my other engineers interviewed him. And he was very rude and condescending throughout the interview. Didn't let me complete my sentences. And I was taken aback. And after we did a debrief, the CEO came in, saw him as, and he was like, no, that guy was wonderful. He was very nice with me. He was very respectful. So I don't know what was the difference. After looking through a debrief notes, it was pretty obvious that the person who came in had a bias towards being respectful to men in particular. And that was a complete, whether or not he was the most smartest engineer in the world. I couldn't have somebody come in and be disrespectful to my team. And this was not just something I thought of. I met the entire team agreed that this was something you would always stand by. So culture shouldn't be something like. You should be willing to not hire if somebody is not your culture and really stand by it. The second people component, especially for a mission-driven company, is definitely surrounding investors. So during the seed round, it was a little bit hard. But ultimately, we ended up in a series A. We got a lot of interest for multiple different investors. Now, say we got somebody on the board who told us that, you know, this is a way you could get more dollars, but you'd have to give up your mission of saving lives in any sense. You know, that's a complete no-go for us as well. And so we wanted to make sure that there is complete mission alignment with our investors. And we took a lot of time with the potential investors, asking them, where do you see one concern in five years? What would you do if you are not seeing dollar traction in this particular market? Really just understanding how they would react to this, and are they really aligned to our larger mission of saving lives? And so we were pretty lucky getting the right board members on board. And I do think that is something you should always insist on getting to know your board members and understanding that we are all all in sync on what our mission is. The third one which is obvious is is your founders, the co-founders you work with. So I was lucky. We were I was friends with my previous co-founders, we synced on our values. But, you know, you need to be I've been so vulnerable with my co-founders several times. I've broken down completely. I've told them all the different flaws I've had, and they've done the exact same thing for me. When things were rough, I could call either a hammer or a tin at 12 o'clock in the night and freak out and let them know, you know, this is the problem. And they would not take hold it against me. They would let me take a stick step back and they would give me their perspective of what I could do better. And I would always do the same for them. Which comes to my second challenge, the emotional burden of, you know, running a company. Being a founder is going to be very lonely. It's going to be very hard because you always want to be the pillar of strength for your employees, for your founders, for your clients, for even some for everybody. You know, you always want to be the pillar of strength who people go to. This is going to be a lot of ups and downs, many downs more than ups generally in the start. And if you are not careful, it can take a really large toll on you. You need to be able to take a step back and do what I did similarly in the rejection piece, which was don't take this rejection too hard, critically on yourself. Take this as opportunities to really learn from it. How can you take that negativity or to and convert it into something you can learn from? And it's very important to find the right support system as well. I have a very, my family is completely bought in initially. They want and then my friends are completely bought in. And they know that I might not be able to spend six months with them because I'm working so hard on one concern, but they all support me through and through. So it's very important to find the right support system, otherwise it will be very, very hard on you. And despite, I guess one last component I want to talk about is don't look too much into the details. When we started a company, the technology was very, very scrappy. He just built a bare bones, web application, you know, actually a machine learning algorithm for on MATLAB, a MATLAB server. And we didn't really care about let's find the most latest technology and let's make it the coolest app ever. What we did instead focused on was let's work with the cities and really figure out what exactly should this be. And now obviously that's not the case. We have a very, very secure lot of micro services and we did invest in technology. But don't overthink that. Focus on what really matters, which is the problem even something you want to work on. And you know, despite all the different challenges I talked about, I would always do this again. The excitement I see with the team I've surrounded with, the opportunity I have to just work with phenomenal people to make a difference, you know, always will make makes it worthwhile. And, and you know, if I didn't do this, I don't even know would this problem still be solved? Would anybody think about it? I'm hopeful that at some point, you know, five years from now, we're able to create at least a single metric on on a wall in the company, which talks about the number of lives we affected in a positive manner. And that would be completely worth it. And so if there is a particular idea you have, or and you really believe that it has to exist, you should go for it. Do some research, obviously the research we did with the different cities. But take that step and don't and as long as you are completely committed and you have the right team with you, you know, it should solve itself out. So I think that's pretty much it. Okay. Thank you. What have been your biggest challenges in fundraising and capitalizing the company? My guess is the Chilean people were ready to write any checks. So what was that experience like and how did you get to where you guys are today? So this is probably going a little bit deeper into the, is it the seed state or the CVS A stage? You're just asking about how I brought the idea. How have you been able to progress to get where you are raising, raising capital for an early stage company is all very challenging and you guys are obviously done a really great job and wondering what you learned through that and what were the keys to success. So just to repeat the question, what were the, how did we manage to get investors on board an idea and what were the large keys to success? I think it was first, you know, we did a lot of research ourselves, you know, it wasn't just trying to build something where we don't really understand whether the market wants. We worked very closely with the cities and that coupled with a Herman's experience in the floods, you know, we understood that there is a big problem here. We knew that market research is probably not an expertise then. So we actually worked with different Stanford grads to help us understand what does, you know, a time or a Sam mean, how would we quantify this, how do you look into the dollars invested in disasters, how do we speak the language of an investor? And so honestly, if I had to shorten it, it's mostly about perspective. I think we were missing the perspective of how we would, the perspective we had with the cities was pretty clear, you know, they got us, they understood why it had to happen, but we're missing that connection with investors, which was exactly how could you convert this idea into a feasible solution. So the nine months we took actually were just trying to keep itering on the product, keep itering on what the packaging would look like, how would this be a business? And I would say the end of the nine months we, you know, it did work out. So yeah. Sorry. I have a question about sales strategy. So I imagine that if you're a city or state government or something like this, there's an obvious benefit to disaster preparedness, but you don't know when the next disaster is going to be, unless you don't know when you will see that benefit. So with that in mind and with the fact that like cities budgets are always constrained, how do you go into a pitch reading with potential clients to make the investment work there? Good question. So cities budgets are limited, but how do we sort of, how does a sales strategy still work despite that? So how I, what I would talk about is now one of the people component I didn't talk about was actually the, the customers you choose, especially for a mission driven company, you want to find the right partners who are also aligned to your mission, because we can very quickly decide to choose a small city who really doesn't care about this, who's just testing this out, and it was not completely committed into making this happen. So what we did was really find cities like San Francisco and LA who not just would be big use cases where we could go to other cities and let them know that this is why you should focus on it, but because they had a large population and a large risk, they were very, very incentivized on how we could sort of make this happen. Now city budgets are definitely still going to be difficult to maneuver, and so what we're trying to do right now from a resilience ecosystem perspective is help, it helps governments on, help cities understand the disasters don't just happen to governments. How can commercial sector come and pitch in to help governments move forward? So if I actually go ahead and repair that one pipe which affects my industry, why should I sort of put in at least one third of that money and help the city out? And many people went through it. It's a complex series of making sure different sectors have different value props. So that's what we're doing now. Yeah, thank you for the talk. I think it could be inspiring about the urban times, right? I was wondering how many cities, regions, you're currently actively working? Yes, so how many cities are we currently working with? We have around eight cities we're working with. These are all pretty large cities, and I, some of them we've talked about publicly, state of Arizona, Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and some international cities as well. So you mentioned that you're a software platform for biotech and real-time analysis, like data, the structure of the city. So what data do you try? Will you get that data? Does it attack into like the service privacy? So what data do we provide track? And is there privacy log which we are, which is present through it? So all of the data we look at is, there's a complex series of data we look at. We look at both manmade information and natural environment information. I'm sorry, I forgot to talk about that. So every information regarding a building, what's the age, what's the material, what's the square footage. We look at last collected soil samples, elevation, and then you also look at the third component which is live data, sensors and satellites. So we look at rivergages, seismographs, weather data, etc. So it's actually a very fairly comprehensive amount of information we have. And we're very upfront with the cities that we don't want any PII information. All we want to do is ensure that we are helping rescue. So we notice on the platform, we could technically do building level predictions, but we obscure it through census block level prediction instead. Unless the building itself is owned by the person and then we provide a more granular prediction. So how do you handle any end open serves that come with any industries paying for this service and they might get preference and if this asks or that responders go to them first. So the question is what if an industry pays more dollars and then they get a priority in response. So how do you deal with it? I mean the best way is to make sure that the risk itself is transparent. As long as all the different players understand that this exactly is what's going on and the city is always where we talk to first. It's always going to be about how can we make the city better. So as long as we are making sure that that's the first lens we prioritize on. Other things sort itself out. So how do you verify accuracy of your models and how are you going to help develop countries where maybe those data sets don't even exist? Validation of accuracy, this is a very hard question, but validation of accuracy and how do we create data in developing countries where data doesn't exist. So validation process is fairly complex. So technically the fire model was completed last year, but we haven't deployed yet because we are going through a very, very rigorous series of validation across all the 500 fires in California and seeing where exactly it performed. Standard validation, standard cross-haul validation, we also do event-based validation, whether we completely take out an event information and see whether or not we're overfitting to a particular event. We put a lot of effort in collecting damage whenever an event happens. So we were there when the Indonesia earthquake happened, we were there when the Mexico earthquake happened, we were there when the Alaska earthquake happened. We collected around 40,000 buildings of damage information in Indonesia, not just to figure out, okay, is a model right, is a model not right, but also to understand the localized information surrounding that. The second one was how would we create data in a place which is doesn't have information. So we're actually deploying in an international developing city, which doesn't have a ton of data. And what we do is, so how do we get this information? Some is public, some is private, and some is from the clients themselves, but a big component of the data is regenerate ourselves. Now features which we statistically infer in the middle, there's a lot of gaps for some buildings we might have, the cost of the home, for some buildings we might have, the height of the home. It's not necessary that all of them are filled. So there's actually many models and statistical inferences to even help fill those gaps. That's one way we could do it, just looking at corollary information. But the second way is we create the data ourselves. So to put it in short, it's sort of like a Google Street View but for buildings and people. So I don't want to talk too much about it, but that's how we are doing the developed developed cities. So go ahead. As a person, I would like to form a company. What kind of do you pay, and how do you look on that? Yeah, so it's a fellow immigrant, what were your major challenges? And how did I overcome them? So I was a little lucky, unlike Ahamed, my family was more or less on board and they were like, you know, you do what you have to do. I don't know if you have this similar issue where you have to convince your family about the risk you're going to take, but that's going to be a exciting challenge. The other challenges are just like I talked about, it's number one is also whether would people want to invest in a company which looks the way we do, and we are selling to government, you know, CEOs, you know, how is that going to work out? So the perception was something which hurt us a little bit, I would say, but we got through it by just, you know, making the right relationships, actually making cities happy, and then after that, it just becomes a blur. You know, nobody actually thinks it looks at it anymore. And then obviously, the visa issues, the debt you would probably have to think about because you already come here, but all of that will sort itself out. If you do have an idea, which you really believe in, so. Yeah. As three technical co-founders, why did you think about splitting roles and developing special changes within the company and external phase? So three technical co-founders, how did we split up the roles? I was the computer science background, so naturally, I think I naturally gravitated towards helping in the technology side and being the chief technology officer. Ahmed was the one who was super passionate, who really connected with people who really had the vision through, and it was natural that he would be the CEO. We were completely on board. And a third co-founder Tim, he actually told us about the cities. He told us, he since he's from Amalek from the Air Force, he's he talked about how they were emergency operation centers in the Air Force, and they might be something similar in cities and states, etc. So he sort of had to create the product, I would say, at the beginning, it wasn't too hard. We just chose what we liked and we went through it. There wasn't, I don't think there was too much of a ego issue because just the mission came first. I don't really want to show that, but this is what we do well. So let's just do this. Go ahead. Much in that environment's investor and the tech. So how can we reach these investors who are taking care of the environment issues and concerns? So how do we reach out to investors who think about this problem? Is that correct? I think it was more word of mouth as well as talking to the different people with you, like which investors would gravitate towards this particular idea, is looking through investment thesis as well. That's how we did it. And then we just really used a lot of different connections we made internally. We hustled a lot. We talked to whoever would be willing to give us that connection. We call LinkedIn several people as well. And I think that's how we made the network honestly. Do you find yourself wanting more basic science data, like a kind of realistic virtual earth geology, realistic virtual earth, hydrology, realistic virtual earth atmosphere? And how would that improve your predictions and allow you to connect the cities more richly? Good question. So should there be more investment in the natural sciences part and how would that help cities? So we are working on something called resilience alliance, wherein we actually work very closely with universities. We understand that all of this, all of the science behind it, we can't do it ourselves. So we're working with the University of Michigan. We actually are also working with the Stanford Urban Resilience Initiative, multiple different folks wherein we would talk about a particular focus and really invest on the natural science component together. So that's how we do it. It's very important because it can't just be us building all of it. The accuracy may not go as high as we would want to then. Yeah. Go ahead. I'll go a little bit on how you see the company scaling over the next couple of years next year or two, even. You know, is it cities? Is it greater penetration within the eight cities that you already have? That'll be my first question. And then the second question is along the same lines. It was the long term. I mean, we've had investors that are on accident some point, and we hope to have a strategic buyer. What, how do you envision it be a term and then kind of five years up? I know that's a big question. So let me take the second. Can you repeat the first question a bit? I just want to make sure. Okay. So for this particular year, we've decided we don't want to do any more cities. We want to go very deep down into into the city space, get in all the different commercial sectors and governments on board to talk the same language. So make sure that resilience and safety becomes a top priority and people are talking about that in that language. That's what we're working on. I don't from the what is the exit strategy? A lot of really large companies are doing really phenomenal work in terms of the convenience space. So now everything is super convenient. We can get food conveniently. We can we can try to work conveniently, but the safety space, which is actually probably higher on the mass loss triangle, is not there's very few companies thinking about it. In healthcare as an example, we really believe that we have an opportunity to actually be a large business. We're not thinking about exit right now in any sense. We're definitely thinking about how do you make this problem actually be solved. That's that's a long way. So did you think about structuring this as a non-profit versus for profit? We actually thought about that. And we had a few and I would say that actually the cities gave us advice. So the cities actually helped us a lot. They helped us not just in creating the product. They even helped us figure out what the pricing was. We went to them and said we would only charge this and they were like that's too low. No one's going to take you seriously and you need to build something here which we can go back to. And the third thing they actually helped us out was non-profit versus for profit. We consider that they were like if you do a non-profit, unfortunately you won't get the velocity which you'd want. And we want to be able to create an impactful company with the velocity and solve this problem in a lifetime. We don't want to keep hearing the issues of climate change and disasters in several decades later. So that's what we chose for a for profit route. So what's the ROI for the government? So monetization strategy ROI for the government. The ROI for the government is twofold. Number one is obviously in the lives which could get saved in the livelihood which are impacted. But number two is really understanding what exact dollars do you need to invest in terms of infrastructure which equally benefits everybody. Now you can't keep having hurricanes like Harvey which keep having the federal government poor dollars over and over again. It's a cyclic issue and there's no way of coming back out of it. So there is a conversation of both the dollars saved and the lives lost. That's sort of how the government scheme works out. Monetization strategy I should talk to you in private but there's a lot of different angles on how would commercial sector and Galtech work together. So cool. Yeah sure. Have you thought about doing a national version? Because there's like a city city by city. A global version, a global model. That's what you're talking about. What if a national one step up? What if it was the US government? The US government. Oh working with FEMA for example. Yeah. We did think about it. Actually we had several advanced conversations with FEMA and they're pretty interested. But this has to generally happen to cities and less to FEMA. I think FEMA comes in when it becomes really large and tries to and provides dollars to have the cities recover. The whole process of recovery itself, you know what resources do you need? How do your first responders work with? It is very, very state and city driven. So that's why we decided to go that way to understand what we could do there. One more question. Yes. Sorry. Yeah. After one more. Go ahead. Just have a comment actually. I was out of talk a few weeks ago. There was a politician, engineer politician from Taiwan. They spent $8 billion on an information system for flood prediction and landslide analysis around 7,000 villages. Eight billion. Eight billion. Okay. That's news. I have this question, but I mean, try to just opportunity outside. So we should look into that then, probably. Oh, thank you for having me now. Yes.
