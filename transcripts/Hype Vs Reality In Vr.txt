 Who you are defines how you built. This is the OddPattern thought-leaders series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. On this episode, we're joined by Tony Mugavera. Tony is the co-founder and CEO of Rad, a consumer streaming platform delivering live and on-demand esports, music, comedy, and sports. Here's host and Stanford lecturer Emily Ma. Let me kick start with a question to you. I know that you've spent decades in the AR and VR space. And right now you are running a company that started in 2015. And maybe you could take us through the journey of how you found yourself in immersive technologies way before it was cool. Yeah, thank you for having me, by the way, that was an amazing intro and a better pitch than I did, I think. So I certainly appreciate that. Yeah, and I think my first real experience with immersive VR was at Wired Neck Best in New York, in the mid-2000s. There was a big mouse wheel that you had to get in and put a VR headset on. And it was, you know, you run around in the mail and it was super conky. And it was $300,000 to install in your house and it blew me away. But, you know, at that time, I didn't think that that was anything in reach for myself. And but I had been building a career in video streaming and from like 2004, 2005. And so when VR started to make its way into the mainstream a little bit more, the mainstream consciousness anyway as a Kickstarter from Oculus, I perked up and said, hey, you know, my experience in distributing content, there's probably going to be a need for that in the VR space. And when I started playing around with the Kickstarter, I got a rift delivered and selling it. And pretty much immediately started building a dedicated platform for it and meeting a couple co-founders. And so we leaned super hard into it and I, you know, the industry started to explode with interest and investment and resources flowing in, new content being created, hardware partners developing all the way up to the biggest tech companies out there. And so, you know, we knew that there was something there and that somebody needed to figure it out. So we were passionate about it and so we leaned into it. Yeah, that's how we got started. That's amazing. Actually, so maybe you could share a little bit more about, by double click on what you just said. You know, maybe you could share a little bit more about how you got Little Star started because I know that AR and VR and mixed reality have had lots of ups and downs. And so, you know, you have mentioned in numerous interviews that you feel like there's a critical mass coming together now. It's maturing. And so, you know, as, what were some of the signals that you saw, more of the concrete signals that you were seeing out in the market with users, with technology that gave you the confidence to get Little Star going in 2015? And where is that now? Yeah, I think it's, it's a lot different now. I think the reality is setting in now, you know, kind of, you know, I think partner hype cycle has a good dual representation of it. There's, you have an overwhelming amount of interest and then as things start to die down a little bit, you help it pitch out and they really start to build. And the hard work begins of building the actual platforms and the businesses that come out of that. And so, you know, when we, when we leaned into it initially, we were the only dedicated distributor of 360 video content. And that meant that all the major movie studios were coming to us and saying, we're experimenting with this. You know, we have Alien VR or, you know, no geographic was touring Yellowstone or, you know, swimming with sharks on Discovery. Is it all two or three minute clips? Like YouTube couldn't support it. Facebook didn't even support it yet. They had an empire toculate. And so we, we were the only place to, to do that. And as that sort of the flow, the content started to flow to, uh, in parallel, the hardware companies that were building these devices perked up and said, okay, well, we were building these devices, but we need companies that are going to put content on these devices for us to sell it to consumers. And so we quickly started forming partnerships with Sony and Google and Kylips and HTC and we were launch partners on all the devices globally. And, and so, and we were building a direct-to-emore application and had content coming from big recognizable names, working with the technology companies that were building the hardware. And then us as a distributor building a direct-to-consumer application started to find ourselves at this intersection of trust where, you know, the content companies needed us, the hardware companies needed us. And so it, it started to build from there. And obviously, you know, 2015, 2016, 2017, there was a lot of investment dollars flowing into space. So we were able to raise capital in that time based on VR pretty in a pretty straightforward fashion. You know, a lot of interest in it and people were making bets. And as things started to cool off a little bit, which I think everybody can see, you know, really only a couple plays in the VR space. You know, Apple's been kind of threatening they're going to do something, but they haven't pulled the trigger yet. They're still very mobile AR base. And, you know, a Facebook innocuous kind of turned into its own beast, but they're continuing to lean into it. So, you know, I think that could be partially ego-driven, but it's also like we're thankful that they're continuing to lift the market. And, and Sony still has a sense of the PlayStation VR. So as we saw the shift in starting to read the T-leaves a little bit on where VR and AR were going, I just think, okay, let's not throw away all of this trust and these relationships and all of this technology that we built, but maybe start to zoom out, expand ARC with a little bit to capture more of the customer, more of the content customer, more of the flagship devices on the hardware side, TV, game consoles, things like that. So still remain innovative and still be a partner to these people, but adjust to what was happening in the industry. And that's kind of what gets us to our today with the platform. You know, Tony, what strikes me in your description of firstly being agile and pivoting, and then secondly, building relationships of trust and partnering, you've created this incredible ecosystem, this web where you're really at the center of it. So with that, for those of us who are not as well versed in the media distribution world, how does RADS business model work with all of these different stakeholders involved? Yeah, well, I think initially we kept everything free, because you know, that's a lot of times early consumer venture backed businesses remain free to capture market share, and then they figure a business model out later. Some of that works great other times that's not the right path. And so, you know, we were able to build a good audience early in the VR space. But as the market started to shift and content started to dry up and people weren't picking VR movies necessarily, like there was really more attention to games, we started to have to think, okay, well, what's the actual model here? And we can keep some of it free, but start to introduce description service and start to bring in not only, you know, some of these some of these VR films are 20 minutes long and you know, really well produced 8K, 360 degree spatial audio, multiple languages, but there's, you know, substantial piece content that are worth paying for, there's just not a lot of it. And so, as we started to introduce more traditional content alongside that, with like, for example, WWE, they created a bunch of 360 degree video, but then they also created a bunch of traditional video. I mean, everybody knows WWE, they have WrestleMania. And then we even experimented with them with AR holograms that we kept in part of them, saw using volumetric video. And so we had, we did our content deal with WWE was 360 video, traditional video, and holograms, which is like a content deal that nobody's doing. And I think people are willing to experiment with, but it puts us in this unique position from a business model perspective, say, we can introduce people to these things for free and give them a taste of it. Then do some of the harder, more expensive things. And you know, even from a content perspective, even traditional content can be expensive, put some of those things behind the actual subscription that start to get the flywheel going a little bit. It breaks the chicken and egg of, you know, we're not making any money on the content, so we can't spend any money on content. And that means we're not going to be able to make any money on the content. It's like, so we were able to break out of that dynamic about, you know, 18 months ago. And it started to roll now as a freemium, you know, very Spotify for for a TV kind of model. Amazing. Amazing. Again, as you speak, I, I, I, I admire you so much for being able to sort of manage all these moving pieces, whether it's your partners developing new technologies, your, you know, content providers creating new content and wanting to work with you in multiple different ways. And one thing that you said to me while we were planning this conversation is, you know, a skill set that you have to have is to be able to figure out which opportunity to pursue because as a, as a, as a company, as a startup, as a CEO, you have to choose where you put your resources. Your resources aren't completely unlimited. You can't go after every single opportunity, right? How do you choose, given that you are building relationships of trust with your partners, given that you're trying to carve out an area for your company? How do you, how do you think about making trade-offs? Yeah, I mean, I think we, we always try to look back at our core DNA, which is, you know, where we started was taking things that were really hard to package up and get to consumers in the form of different, you know, content bundles, whatever it is. Doing that as an innovation partner to hardware companies and the content companies is part of our DNA. And that's, that's what has provided value to us as a company. And it's, it creates differentiators in the consumer market for us to do things that are ahead of everybody else. Because like, how do you keep with Netflix and they're spending billions of dollars on the, you know, content? And we just can't compete with that. So, you know, I think in terms of picking, we're, however, thinking about what we're working on, it always helps for us to go back to say, you know, does this line up with our core DNA where we've created value? And, you know, that doesn't mean that we can't shift the business, but still point back to the DA. So, you know, looking at VRAR only, that market is too small, particularly for, I mean, it's growing, but it's still too small for, you know, like venture outcomes. Right? And a handful of companies have been acquired. Lots of companies have just failed. It's been shut down. And the companies that have been bull and shifted kind of how they think about what they're doing, they've survived and thrived. And so, I think tried to listen to what we, what we were built on in our principles, but then, you know, still honor those relationships that we had with the content companies, not their companies. So, now we can go back and instead of Google Daydream VR, it's talking to Android TV, which is a flash device. And they're saying, hey, we have Google Voice Assistant that we want you guys to do some interesting things with. You did some really cool stuff with VR. Can you, can you have some, making TVs more immersive? Yes, that fits our core DNA. We can get a device, you know, a year in advance, work on SBKs that are undocumented and our engineers can figure it out and work back and forth with their engineers behind the scenes. And that's allowed us to, it's provided enough with a guidepost for us to say, this is what we're good at. And as opportunities are coming our way, you know, some of them sound interesting, but then we say, well, this may be distracting. So, maybe we, maybe we shouldn't do this because it's not core or what we're at. And so, there's been some potentially short-term lucrative deals that we've had to pass up because it would have turned us into a production company or an ANC as opposed to a technology company building an engine for doing, you know, very advanced distribution of content. So, yeah. Very powerful. You know, what this reminds me of is, as a startup, thinking about company, culture, company, value, use of company DNA and making that very explicit is actually really, really important. It's in some ways even more important than building a technology that is defensible because that allows you to make these trade-offs in a thoughtful manner and you have to stand for something otherwise, you're going to fall for everything. So, you know, I really appreciate you making that very, very clear to our students today because many of them have a tech background and love racing to, you know, solving a tech problem, but yet the culture, DNA, the values are so so critical. So, it's been quite the year if I might shift a little bit and, you know, with your core DNA in mind, COVID brought a lot of change to, I mean, all of our lives. And so, could you tell us maybe a little bit more about how rad has experienced COVID and how your community has shifted, your partnerships have shifted, how you've shifted during these sort of unprecedented times in the past 12 months? Yeah, I mean, I think we, when we first started the company and being VR-centric, we had, we had immersive technologies as a way to bring people to the platform and they were able to have fun and do cool things. And that was a real differentiator for us. There was nobody else doing it at the time. And that changed, that changed as the years went on. But at the beginning, that was a real differentiator for us. And so, when we started looking at, you know, as COVID started to take hold and people were at home more often, we actually thought of rise in the amount of VR use in our apps because people were buying VR headsets. And I think they wanted to escape reality. But since we had already kind of expanded into more traditional video content and even supporting live streaming is, so we got, we had a number of our, of our partners coming to us. We have a bunch of music on the platform. And so, a number of those partners came to us and said, can you support live streaming music events? And, you know, we said absolutely yes. And so, we started to put together this combination of, you know, if you just had a PlayStation or a TV or a phone, you could watch the live stream on the phone. And if you had a VR headset, then we created these like animated VR environments that, you know, we did electric daily carnival and there was like psychedelic planets flying around. And so, you know, there was a, there was still kind of this bringing back to the where art is because we did throw all of that technology away. But we broadened the scope out of, you know, doing charity live streams and huge electronic music festivals. And, you know, and allowing people to chat, we introduced this watch party capability that allowed people to chat around the content. And that was all being like, okay, these people are at home. They need to connect with their friends. They're trying to escape reality. What tools do we have at our fingertips? To make that better. And so, that's what we did. Amazing. Amazing. I think you also mentioned people want to meditate together. Is that right? Like all these things that go good. Yeah, we had, there's a number of different use cases. I mean, we've done like, we've had like ASMR and VR, you know, we've done like yoga holograms that show you how to do the proper form and you can, you know, put the instructor in your living room. So that's going to be coming out in next month. So, yeah. So, there's like those kinds of, those kinds of things we looked at, you know, there's this guy who we've worked with who basically does like four minutes of use sitting on the beach in Costa Rica in VR. And it's just in beach and waves and, you know, you're relaxing. And so, you know, that's part of the premium bundle that we have. And it's like, if you want to go relax on the beach in VR, you totally can't. So, yeah, since some interesting use cases that have come out of it and how we thought about the effect that COVID has had on people, from a direct consumer perspective, there's been lifts on our, on our business, which has been nice. But, you know, I always remind the team that, you know, we're so lucky to be in a position to see any kind of lift. And so, what can we do to honor that? And so, we're not, that's not lost on us, for sure. It's so humble, so humble for the sake. So, with COVID, I'm actually curious now that you seen this lift, now that you've seen people sort of relax their notions of what an experience needs to be. I'm still kind of stuff on the yoga hologram one. That's very interesting to me. Do you, are you more excited about the future of the space? As a result, did you think like COVID actually like a celebrated adoption? Do you think we're in a better place as a result of this changes that have happened? Yes, yes. Yeah, I mean, I think it kind of accelerated everything has to do with you being at home and engaging in technology. I mean, it's Zoom as a prime example. You know, you've seen that like Peloton explode and, you know, the mirror to work out at home and things like that. So, there's going to be some permanent shift. It might be 20% of the world has some kind of permanent shift in their lifestyle. Maybe once everybody's vaccinated, it goes back to normal, but, you know, arguably, I think it will change behavior, consumer behavior, and it did change consumer behavior more rapidly, which is one of the most difficult things to change. It's why VR had a really hard time getting out there. And even on mobile phones, it's cool and gimmicky, but, you know, your arms get tired after holding your phone up and moving it around, like your shoulders get tired. That's not a human behavior. We've optimized our experience to a game controller, and all we have to do is move our fingers about that much. And that's esports. That's sports now. That. You got to have fast fingers. Humans are lazy. Humans are lazy. So, you know, like for people to put on a VR headset and move around, or, you know, to do, you know, anything, it really substantially, and change human behavior. That's a really hard thing to do. We ran headlong into that wall. And I think the industry did also. It's a tough thing to change consumer behavior. And I think you know, COVID rapidly changed consumer behavior, which is something that's almost impossible to have to have a forcing function to really change human behavior. If you just let it happen, it'll tend to lasing us. I love your comment that humans are lazy. Fundamentally lazy. So just default to that. That's a good thing. That's a good thing. You know, like the best engineers are lazy engineers. They're like, I don't want to ever solve this problem again. I'm solving it one. You're here. Well, I'm going to have a few more questions for the next 10 minutes or so. I do want to hand it over to the students to ask many, many questions. I want to pivot over to your extensive experience as an entrepreneur over the course of many, many, many successful companies. You spent some time building a company to help other startups galvanized. You were a venture capitalist. I was curious how you decided to make that shift. You went from being an entrepreneur to being more of a venture capitalist. That's one shift. And then you shift it back. Could you tell us a little bit more about that chapter of your career? Yeah, yeah, definitely. I mean, I'd like to get my hands dirty and build. And I think I also enjoy teaching things that I've learned to other people so that they don't have to make the same mistakes. And even when I was at SMU, I was a teaching assistant there. And even substitute was a substitute teacher for like kindergarteners when I even started working perfectly as an engineer. So I've always kind of had that streak in me and but always like to build things. So through entrepreneurship, I found myself going into pitch VCs and there's a story and getting better at that. And I think and I saw an opportunity I haven't gone through it a little bit myself and bang around and made mistakes that maybe I could be helpful to some of those people to avoid those but also it's a relationship game and relationship is, relationships are almost more valuable than capital. So inserting myself at the center of a community and building relationships with other entrepreneurs and other VCs and doing that more rapidly and building that community. I thought it felt right at the time and I'm still so thankful that I had that experience. But over time, I got the itch to build something new technology related again and operate. And so you know it just changed from a learning mode and I'm going to open this open my mind up to chapter and try to help people and learn as much as I can myself. But then eventually it turned into I need to engineer I need to engineer a new product and get my hands dirty again. And I always joke with my wife that that galvanizes was like I went to engineering school. So you know computer engineering and I always joke with my wife that galvanizes was like getting paid to get my masters a bit. You know it's like I completely flipped out of engineering and just learned about you know how to raise a ventrophone you know what it meant to be LPs and GPs and write checks in the companies in the seed rounds and A rounds and you know convertible notes and why you would set something up as a C-Corp versus LLC and all of those things were very rapid fire and very hands on. And so yeah it was a great great learning experience and I think we were able to help some companies. So I feel good about that but back back to getting my hands dirty. Amazing amazing you literally hopped on the bike without knowing how to ride the bike and just like rode the bike when you went and beat you to BC. Yeah that's way to learn. I want to go back to something you said which actually applies to your time at galvanize but also what you're doing with your partnerships ecosystem now which is the importance of relationships and how you build them and you clearly are really incredibly skilled at that. And I think at least for me as an engineer took me many many years to kind of even get like to like novice level. Like what sort of advice do you have to engineering students in building relationships of trust? Yeah I mean I think that that realization for me came later with a light and it's something that you can get built into some degree in the Greek system in college and you know that you can build relationships in school and but if you're not really proactive about being in different networks of people and bouncing ideas off of people as fast as you possibly can learning from other people and iterating on ideas with people in real time and having drinks with them and having coffees with them and that's where the richness really comes from and the genuine connections with people comes from and it stops everything from being transactional and just doing work with them. And I found that a lot in conversations with the EOs you know that there's some CEOs that are very much like you know I don't have time for this and I'm very strict about how I spent my time you know I don't have time to just jump on the phone and just chit chat and that I understand that to some degree like some people try to take this stance of like very busy so like either you're doing business with me or we're not talking about anything. I try to take a little bit different approach and I think it's very important to have conversations with your peers on a regular basis they're always going through struggles you know that you can always learn from them and so if you know another CEO reached to me and left a conversation and just wants to have a coffee with no agenda then I have that conversation because we get to form a relationship and then down the road then it's like when you call them and you're like hey do you know so and so or hey I'm trying to get into this fund or I'm trying to do a partnership with this other CEO they don't transactional just helping you because you're friends and so you know those genuine kind of authentic relationships are so important and that's why I say more value of capital you know if you have if you have the right relationships it really doors just start to open you know set them on the outside trying your way in it's like you just have a network of people that are all helping each other and so yeah I feel like that is such an important thing in entrepreneurship to focus on to be really proactive about that I was just head down building when I graduated from from college I just like coding not thinking about like hey I should be building my network and so yeah I like that's really important piece of the puzzle of entrepreneurship for sure you know Tony they don't have a class in that at at school it's very weird right we take all these functional topics we get really good at like mechanics really good at like you know artificial intelligence but there's like it's actually a really important skill to to be able to gain that social capital for time and then to also spend it very wisely and and you are incredible in doing that you have one other piece of advice that I thought was incredibly powerful in another talk that you did for entrepreneurs you said that one of the most well the most important piece of advice for entrepreneurs is to be like water and I was very touched by that could you maybe give a little bit more meat to what you mean by be like water yeah I mean it's it's just like go it's go with the flow you know path path of existence it's it's not always it's not always about the least resistance but it's just flexibility is so important and and that kind of expands into empathy and understanding and you know the the people that you're working with if something happens and something comes up and it's and it's going to be you know a challenge to have to deal with that's okay you'll fit you know you you you'll figure out and you start to figure it out together it's not about you know who said what and when and you know arguing about all of that when something comes up start to figure it out and flow around it and lean into it and make it work and and so you know over the last a hand of years the core team of of Little Star as and now as we've kind of transitioned the bread the brand to rad as we go through those challenges and you're in the trenches of people doing doing really challenging kind of decision making in the moment the last thing you want to have happen is for the be friction you're all in it together and it's okay to disagree and have like productive kind of proactive debate about things but everybody is understanding of each other's position and suggesting that you know if something everybody stuck on something you're suggesting something there's there's ways to flow through any kind of issue that you know taking that approach is like it just generally in life I mean entrepreneurship you need that if you don't have that everybody blows up and the band breaks up and you know start up all the part co-founders leave and you know like you just can't you can't operate that way that's that's just in business but in life I mean if you approach all relationships that way and like life just seems to get better it's like instead of your instead of everything that you do being contentious like we'll figure it out how bad can possibly be so yeah I've tried to take that approach more like as you know things progressed in the last handful of years in particular because earlier on I thought that like you had to like stay hard and fast to something and if you know you didn't then you were earlier and really that's like the counter to what you should do as a as somebody in as an entrepreneur you should come up with a thesis tested as fast as you possibly can figure out if you're wrong and go to the thing that closer to being right and and oh you know that that mentality is very much like I'm going to find I'm going to find the path of least resistance as quickly as possible and you know so that's kind of where that that mentality comes from that's incredible it's so incredible just even your time that back to relationships and just life right it's it sounds like it's much easier to live a happy life by being like water rather than you know always being at longer heads yeah exactly I'm going to kick off the student Q&A so first question Sidesh asks with budding technologies that may take a long time to adopt how do you temper long-term business versus research goals with short-term goals or business and research goals with short-term goals yeah I mean I think we had to be realistic about you know looking at looking at creating a new industry which was essentially I mean the VR industry kind of been around for a long time but the consumer modern consumer VR history was effective creating a new market and not resegmenting an existing market and so you have to approach in a different way in that you know you can't just spend all of your money on R&D trying to figure it out it's like you have to come up with some of a paradigm that has worked in other worlds and bring that into this new innovative thing and and then lay those on top of each other so that even though the new technology is there a familiar model exists so that you know you're not just down in the weeds burning money on R&D so you know we we do have a handful of things that we are kind of constantly playing around with in terms of R&D and we do hackathons and you know our engineers contribute to open source and we play around with things like go current fees and you know so there's there's all kinds of you know R&D type things that we do but the core business around content distribution and working with hardware partners and content partners has largely stayed the same and it's a similar paradigm to other streaming platforms that exist but we're just doing innovative things that kind of carve out a white space for us so it is a delicate balance but really have to be focused on building an actual business especially with venture capital it's so easy to just get lulled into comfort with money in the bank because you don't have to build a business occasionally that works but not a lot thank you for saying that all right next question maybe in similar vein how do you build a company that is simultaneously stable in the present market and adaptable for future markets yeah I think that that kind of dovetails from previous answer it's it's it's a little bit of R&D that we have to think okay how are we building for the future and but not sacrificing the existing business and it's a little bit of the innovators dilemma everybody's familiar with that but so many people get caught up in that where they only focus on their existing business and they never focus on the future and then over time they get disrupted by somebody else who has been thinking about and they've been focusing on their business which from a management perspective is a smart thing to do but a lot of people don't don't have the invasion component to kind of think to the future and so you know we I think try to balance that in a way that allows us to continue to be innovative but also realistic about what the core business is yeah thank you next question a little bit of a pivot away which is why did your service rebrand from little start to rad and does it indicate a pivot or shift from your original vision or problem that your service seeks to result yeah I mean I think as we sir we in in VR it was a niche community that we thought was going to be more mass market and rad has it's a tie a little star I mean we thought the name came from like radiance and and there was we were thinking like how does this tie the stars and so the the idea that it's still tied to little star but it was a little bit easier to you know there wasn't any missing letters simple it's short it's easy to remember little stars easy to remember but and then also like you know there's a lot of our content partners they I think in the VR space they can get the nuance around little star it's like if if you watch anime you know I think america audiences miss a lot of the new on anime but like in in Japan everybody like this is so amazing you know it's it's similar to that I think little star had a lot of nuance to it in that in that VR and AR community got that but the broader content and mass market consumer not connected that as much and in fact you know when you're dealing with Hollywood people don't want to be little stars they want to be Bayards so you know we started to think about who our audience was and it's kind of a younger millennial older gen z there's there's actually the millennial go back to when rad was actually like used a lot in in the you know kind of slang and I grewings were actually rad but you know the younger generation gen z is now also reusing rad all the time so it's it's connects to language in a way that connects to you know an older demographic a younger demographic it talks about what we do it's easy to remember so it's kind of a lot of things culminated into how we were changing the scope to more mass market content and who we were approaching and approaching them so yeah amazing amazing and and it's it's again you're being like water you're adjusting and and reshaping as your company evolves so beautiful okay I don't fully understand what this question is it's a very long question so I'm going to read the first. I fully understand it I don't even have to read it I know exactly what it's about. I do need to read it so that our YouTube life those can hear it. I'm gonna I think I know what's going on but I'm not gonna read the whole thing so the question is do you have anything to comment regarding the dispute between independent investors especially the Wall Street bets people on subreddit and hedge funds regarding GameStop and there's lots of stuff going on right now GameStop and I'm I'm just gonna head to you because I know very little about this topic. Yeah yeah yeah I mean my my Reddit account is 14 years old I've been on Reddit for a very long time and I saw Wall Street bets be born on Reddit and have seen a lot of the conversation that goes on there and there are some really there's a lot of like idiots doing a lot of stupid investing but there's some really smart people on there coming up with strategies and diligence around companies that that they found value in and so you know I've always kind of been you know I don't know how best to put it but somewhat of a an anarchist are like against against the man to some degree like I always fight for the underdog and I love a good underdog story who doesn't but I you know I feel like you know I certainly don't fall on the side of defending Wall Street here I think having communities and retail investors have access to the same things that hedge funds have access to is is critically important for how we should be shaping investment in the future and you know particularly you can look at IPOs for example you know like a retail investor can't participate in an IPO and can't even participate in in the private market before things get to an IPO and you know guess what VCs all are pumping that stock time they write the check the the angel check and they they just get to do that in private with their buddies that's that like you can look at along the way and watch when what happens when a lot of these companies IPO you look at their balance sheet and they're losing 200 million dollars a quarter but they buy PO'd and everybody you know what you know who gets you know who buys in retail at the last minute they're holding the bags because all the people all the the private private equity people got in in a way that none of the retail people could get in and so they pump it all the way to the point of a ridiculousness and then leave retail holding the bag and you know the IPO pops right away and then it starts to die and falls off and the retail people are like well I got in at the peak of the IPO now it's dying you know plus 50% of it sometimes it goes up whatever but the same thing has played out here on Wall Street bets and and hedge funds it's just been reversed retail has figured out how to pump the value because they've identified a strategy that puts the hedge funds holding the bag and so it's genius I mean it's genius and the thing about EC's CNBC and Bloomberg and they're like you have these hedge fund managers calling in and talking about it's a manipulation they do the same thing and they've been doing it for years and EC Akman go on and talk about everything he's shorting and how he thinks everything's going to go to zero or he thinks everything's going to go to the moon they go on and manipulate stock in plain view and leave retail holding the bag and this moment is basically putting you know what's the now the community's like three million people because it's been memes like crazy but Wall Street bets is basically it was a small group of people that was community driven hedge fund strategy and they identified something that was gunna pop and and did it you know and and now everybody's mad about it all it did was expose what hedge funds have been doing and private vent equity has been doing for a year for decades and you know here we are I'm on I'm on the Wall Street bets team you know like and I got in game stop at 60 you know like I thought that was too late I was looking at it at 20 and I was like are these guys serious like this thing is going to moon and now so I took the ride amazing amazing well let's talk one more question about underdogs because I know you want to cheer them on so for those of us who are in bi-pop communities LGBT you know underrepresented groups what is your advice as we're last question for this what is your advice in terms of founders in those categories raising capital yeah I mean I think I'm I'm thankful now that that the world is is waking up to the fact that brilliance comes from everywhere and there should never be any you know any other consideration other than merit and you know what you're doing it does it have value and is it cool and this is interesting can it benefit the world and you know like people are finally waking up at and so not to not to say that there hasn't been a struggle and you know where it's come from but you know we even from a content perspective you know it's we feel like it's important to represent as many perspectives as possible and you know they're all they're all they all have levels of importance and everybody no matter who they are has you know good and bad views on things you can people from from every group and say you know they're great things and they're bad things and so you know we we just try to identify it a good from you know as our own company but you know if you look out in the broader kind of investor community and what's happening you know the investment and you know minorities women LGBT to it's it's all becoming very intentional now and and I think that attention is really good um I've always I I was just raised you know Southern hospitality be good to people you know take care then they'll take care of you and so I've never even thought about that being a thing like as a consideration I'm just like you're my brother you're my sister so like in you're building something cool then you should get investment if you're trying to raise it you know it's and so I've never understood how anybody can have a separate mentality like a different mentality that like splits people up and says that somebody's more deserving than you know there's probably some natural tendency of humans to gravitate to things that are like them and so you know that that's a an introspective thing that I think people have to look at themselves and say um am I doing this right now or am I am I looking at this like the bigger picture and and so um I think I think there's more opportunities now than ever and anybody who has any concern that they might not be able to raise capital go into that room and slam your fist down on the table and tell them why you deserve it the entrepreneurial
