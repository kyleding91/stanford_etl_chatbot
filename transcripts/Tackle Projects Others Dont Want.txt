 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Today I have the incredible pleasure of introducing Matt Rogers, who's the co-founder and VP of Engineering at Nest, which is one of the fastest growing tech companies in the valley and is pioneering new technology for smart homes of the future. Matt is responsible for all product development at Nest and prior to Nest, Matt was responsible for iPod software development at Apple. Join me in welcoming Matt. How's it going? It's solid. So grads, I saw undergrads how many undergrads? Most. So, I was in your shoes not that long ago by the way. So I graduated undergrads in 04. So 10 years. A lot could happen in 10 years by the way. Actually in fact, your entire career could happen in 10 years if the star is in the right way. I think I'll talk about a few of those things. So let's get started. So one, I'm a software engineer by training. I went to Carnegie Mellon, not Stanford, by the way. Then you get into Stanford. They still ask you to donate though, if you don't graduate from Stanford by the way. This is a funny thing. That said, it's great to be here. And I'll take a little bit by myself kind of how I got here, a little bit by Nest, and kind of what's gotten really hard as we've grown and a little bit of what's coming ahead. A little bit about the future. So to get started. So I've always been involved in technology. I've always loved technology. And I think something that's special of our generation. I'll say that our generation, even though I'm about a decade old in you guys, is that we grew up with technology. I think this is different. This is actually a fundamental change. If you look at kind of the generation before us that was born in the 70s, and our generation, this is a fundamental change. We grew up with technology. We went to school. There were computers in the classroom or computers in the library. You guys have smartphones and laptops. We didn't have those when I was growing up. But that said, growing up with technology at a young age changes your mindset as to how you interact with the world. And I got some of the fundamental shift that we're seeing. And actually it enables a lot of the companies you're seeing created today. So I'll touch on a little bit more. So growing up with technology, I had my first computer at age three, a Mac plus one of these beige Macintoshes that you see kind of in the old photos in the museums these days. But I actually grew up with one of those. And I loved it. And I really, really young age, age five, I wanted to work in Apple. It was kind of my dream job. But I've always wanted to do my entire career. And I had that in mind, actually as I went into school, as I kind of learned, even as a kind of teenager, I volunteered at the kind of in the technology classes and the computer club to help set their networks and all those kind of things. And loved it. Very different way of growing up than many of my classmates as you can imagine many of them. Or like ten of stars and those kind of things. But I really lived computers. And that's what I really wanted to do. But then in high school I had this opportunity to start a robotics club. How many guys know about first robotics? How many of you guys did first robotics in your high school? Very, very few. So that's interesting. So first, started by Dean Cayman who invented the Segway, lots of medical technology, a multi-hundred gazillionaire, and actually a revolutionary kind of guy in a really big thinker. But he started back when I was in high school. It was a program to get young students involved in science and technology. So this program called First is kind of like a football for high school students, but more in the technology space. So they design like these big competitions with stadiums and have celebrities come to get people excited about technology. And my school is, you know, we're in a small town with the university and we're like, I think we could probably start one of these. We'll need some help from the university. We don't have a lot of money, but maybe we get something started in myself. My teacher, professor at University of Florida, I got together and we started this thing and it was a ton of fun. We built robots. We basically built a robot that could pick up balls and kind of don't come out of basket, which was really a big deal for like a bunch of sixteen year olds. And it got me really excited. I was like, I can build this robot. Like, this is a whole career. And that got me down the path towards Carnegie Mellon entering the robotics program there. And that was an amazing experience. And I'm going to mentally change my perspective on building technology. You could build technology that isn't just kind of in the virtual world, but also in the physical world. So one of the things that I did at CMU and I think a lot of you guys do here at Stanford is you kind of mix disciplines. It's very cross-disciplinary. So you work on software. There's hardware behind that. There's physical, there's mechanical engineering that goes behind that. For many folks, there's biochemical, there's medical engineering. These kind of technology domains kind of mix together. So that was my first kind of encounter with that. But what also I realized, and with the advice of a really close professor, Yokei Matsuoka, who is my advisor at CMU, was that academia is probably not the right way for me to go. I did this summer with her working on a robotic hand that was controlled by the brain. It was a really kind of cool project for undergrad. It's something that was way over my head. But what I realized that this was like a 10-year kind of project. And for me to stick around in her lab for 10 years, it's probably meant me to go and say. I had a lot of energy. I still have a lot of energy. It turns out. And she's like, Matt, I think for next summer you should intern at a big company and learn about building products. So I applied a bunch of companies and Apple called me first. And I was like, hold these shit. How awesome is this? The company I've always wanted to work for as a kid, where I had the pictures of myself as a 12-year-old, smiling in front of an infinite loop. I'm like, I can go intern at Apple. This is amazing. They call me back. I was like, I have to be there. And we don't want you to work on the Mac. We're starting this other team called the iPod team. They're doing music players. I was like, great, that sounds great. I didn't really know what the iPod was or why it was important. But it sounded great. So I got there and they didn't tell me what I was working on or what I was going to do. But I sat there, I got to my desk and they stuck me next to the printer cube. So there's the big laser printer that the whole office would use. And my computer was kind of shoved in there. And I was like, the intern. It was kind of the classic intern job where people would walk by and they'd get their stuff off the printer and say, hey, I'm Steve. What do you do? I'm at I'm the intern. That was how I started my career at Apple. And on my second day, a guy walked by and said, hey, I'm Tony. I'm like, hey, I'm at the intern. I said, so what do you do here? He's like, well, I built the iPod. I'm like, oh, you're a really good guy to know. And that's how I met my co-founder now at NAS Tony Fidel. My second day is an intern. I was completely embarrassed myself not knowing who he was. How would I know? I was the intern, right? That was a really fun summer, though. Not in the fun sense where we had a lot of beer. Although some interns did that, I actually didn't get a chance to do that. My internship centered around reinventing how they built the iPod. So iPod was a really small team within Apple. It's kind of a startup within Apple. It was an experiment. And when you do kind of startups, there's sometimes corners you cut to get things going. Technical debt you may accumulate. You guys maybe familiar with something like a concept of this. And the manufacturing for the iPod was never something that the team fully owned. It was constantly outsourced. And this is something that we should own. Like, we're building millions of these a year. We probably should know how we build them. So that was my job as an intern. Just figure out how we built iPods and how we could do it better, how we could test them better, and then rewrite all the software we used to manufacture them. It's pretty easy task, right? That's not really a big deal. It's something that you definitely give it in turn. Like, responsible for probably 25% of the company revenue at the time. Why not? So that was my job. And part of how I've always approached problems is, even as a kid, my mom would say, like, Matt, we need to go dig a ditch. Great, let's go dig a ditch. By the way, that's good career advice. Like, in general, when someone gives you a really hard problem, just get excited about and figure out how to solve it. Some people tend to spin. That doesn't always work. So really excited to kind of reinvent how to manufacture iPods. And I did a lot of all-nighters, as it turns out, and to the point where there was one day when Tony had to call my boss and said, can you make sure the intern goes to sleep tonight? Because he's got a big day tomorrow. There was a time kind of around August, just before I was ready to go back to school, and they said, I think it's time to kind of roll this forward. And they were getting ready to launch the iPod mini for that holiday season. So my stuff was going to go live. And they were going to switch the manufacturing line over and hope this would all work. And I tested it all at a time. It was going to be fine, right? It turns out it didn't all work. And nothing ever works the first time. But after a series of all-nighters, we actually got things running. And I worked with a team in China. We got things up and running. So I had proofed myself as an intern, which is an opportunity that many of you guys probably have. How many guys intern over the summer at company startups around the area? So for those who didn't raise your hand, please do it. It is the most valuable experience you could find. For the Mayfield Fellows in the back, I'm sure you guys got a great experience last summer. We're not this summer that's coming. We had a bunch of Mayfield Fellows in this last year. It was great. But internships, super important. You'll learn a time. You'll get a feeling for what it's like to have, like, an amazing life in the real world. And that's not just in the cliche sense, but also like to get a feel of working with it at a company. Really important. Turns out working on hard problems at school and building projects at school to a deadline for a quarter or a semester is very different than when the company depends on your success. Part of the conversation I had had with my manager at the time was, if I had failed, we may not have iPods for Christmas. And shareholders are really unhappy when that happens. It's kind of a detrimental. And if you're interested in entrepreneurship and you start companies, the same kind of thing happens. If you fail, the company may go under. And these kinds of things have consequences. So that was my internship at Apple. Obviously, they invited me back. It was thrilled to come back. So I went back to Apple in O5 after I finished my masters and started out as a software engineer in the iPod team. Basically, on the tail end of that first iPod nano. And being the new guy in the team who had built some credibility, but was still a proomers to the new guy, they said, let's give him the least important project. And something that we may not ever ship, but we need someone to work on it. Because we have to have a resource on this project. And that was this new prototype project called the iPhone. So it's funny. You guys laugh at the time we laugh too. We're like, who cares about this phone thing? We make iPods here. We're never going to sell any phones. Seriously, I'm not joking. So we started this very, very skunk works kind of thing out in Apple. Very, very small team. It was like a hardware guy, a antenna designer, my cell, a program manager, a really, really small team to start the first iPhone. And that first prototype did not really work. It was kind of disaster. But we learned a lot on the way. And 18 months later, after hundreds of people's efforts at POP, the first iPhone, which was a completely different story for a completely different time. And many books have been written about that year. But it was nonetheless a very exciting year, which we learned a lot. And I think for me, the most important thing I learned was how to lead programs. So when you're the first guy working on something, what happens next is that the second guy has questions on what the stuff the first guy worked on. And hopefully the first guy is able to articulate what he did. And if you can imagine that cycle perpetuating, when you have guy 100 joining a project, it's good to have found a knowledge. So that's kind of the culture we built at the time. And the reputation I had developed was that if you had a question, had a problem, like talk to Matt, he probably built it in asking how it went. And that's kind of my informal introduction to leadership. That's how I kind of learned. It's never something I thought I'd get into. I'm a really introverted guy. Super, super quiet. I don't speak in public. I'll be speaking in public right now. As you can imagine, one of the things that you learned is that kind of building these connections with your fellow co-workers and project mates is that you start to build a team. And it's like building robotics back in high school or playing soccer. And you're on the team, you're working with each other. And if someone misses a shot, you try to help Matt. So that's what we did. And I learned how to lead teams through that. And learned how to communicate and how to build project plans. And learn how to do the end to end. And throughout the rest of my career at Apple, I was kind of the guy they gave new stuff to to go build teams. So when we started taking over and doing a new shuffle, like Matt, you start the new shuffle program. No problem. I'll go do that. By the way, no one else wanted to shuffle. It's one of those kind of hobby projects that they don't want to do. But it turned out to be really big success for Apple too. So again, building your career on things that many people think are not important. But sometimes they're worth taking a bet on. There's a couple of things like that too, like manufacturing. Manufacturing is not like the glory work of Apple, as you can imagine. Like the UI work and the industrial design is kind of the big sexy stuff. But it turns out manufacturing is really important. And you can learn how things are made that way. And build a whole career out of it, which it kind of did actually. So that was my career at Apple. It was really exciting. It was basically my dream job. Something I've always wanted to do my entire life. But then I left. And this is one of those kind of moments when my family would call me and my grandpa would say, like, are you crazy? You're making how much money with a really stable job, with the biggest company in the world. And you want to leave. And you want to not make any money? How are you going to do this? I'm like, I have some money saved up. It's going to be OK. Tony, I have a really cool idea that we're going to go push. And we did that, actually. And it's funny that the same people who were very much naysayers then are now like my biggest advocates. It's funny how that works. These kind of things are, families are complicated. I'll put it that way. Families are completely different. There's a different course for family dynamics. And psychology school, that's found the hall. I'm not going to cover that one. So starting nest, it was a very interesting discussion, which got started with nest. I'd always been interested in the home. I had bought this house back in Apple. It was like a 1970s house. And it was literally the epitome of the 70s. Like, beige appliances, LED displays with dials on them. The wood panelled walls, like literally a house of the 70s. And I was on the toilet with an iPhone. It didn't really make any sense. These things didn't work all around me. My whole world had changed. And I assume you are like, how many guys use iPhones, Android phones every day? I'm assuming 100% of hands are up right now. That's my point. Our lives have changed. Yet, our homes are essentially exactly the same as they were in the 1970s. And that's fucked up, by the way. It doesn't make any sense. It makes literally no sense. And that was the opportunity we saw. But you can't build a company with a kind of a, you could have a grand vision, but that's completely impractical. Like, if you ever pitch an investor saying, we have a really grand vision, we're going to reinvent the home. We'll tell you later how we're going to do it. They'll probably laugh at you because that's not how you build companies. You can't, it's good to have a grand vision in this huge room app that things are going to do, but it's good to start with being really, really concrete, discreet. And that alone could be a business. So that's what we pitched. We pitched the idea of, let's go build a company based on thermostat. And many people laughed at us then too, actually, it was really funny. I built, actually, I think I built my entire career. I actually played my entire life's work on things that no one cares about. And I've actually done really well doing it, which goes to show you that things that don't people don't care about, actually are really important. And that's what we found out. So Tony and I back in the day, we're back in the day, is like 2009, holy cow, section out that long ago. We're doing some research in the home and basically figuring out, what can we do? He had building a home, I had a home, we looked at all these products, and it turns out that heating and cooling are half of home's energy. And yet, everyone knows what products exist there. They do now that we've brought this to people's attention. But back when we were starting the company, no one was aware of how much energy was going into their heating and cooling. It's like $1,000 per household per year. That's kind of mass scale. If you think about large problems, things that should keep governments up at night, home HVAC is probably not one of them, but should actually. It's like, that's more than all the solar plants in the US, probably the worldwide combined. It's more than all the nuclear power plants in the US produce. It's kind of that level scale. But yeah, no one really paying attention to it. But we realized that we could build a company just doing that. And given that company, we could then build a platform to do more. That was the whole premise. It was actually really simple. And that's what we went to go do. So the two of us got started early, early 2010, and started calling our buddies. The people we had built relationships with back in all those teams in previous years. For me, that was the guys I built the iPod with, the guys I built the iPhone work with. That professor who convinced me not to go to academia, she joined the team. These friends of their professors, they may come in handy later. Tony called his buddy. So guys, he had worked with a general magic kind of the iPhone of 20 years ago, no one had ever heard of, but it was actually a really kind of great hub of technology. And we got this team together of some really, really smart, motivated folks who actually took no salary. Like they believed in us. They believed that we could build a company doing thermostats. And that's what we did. And we spent a better part of 18 months building a thermostat. And when Jose, who runs our recruiting team and I would go out and meet candidates are at this point all candidates where people we knew, we're like, we want you to quit your job running the iPhone team. To go build a thermostat with us. And most of them were like, you're crazy. But the nothing we're crazy, like I could see this. Energy savings, hundreds of millions of homes. This could be a big business opportunity. And a lot of people joined. So that first year, we hired about 70 people. That's a lot for a startup. It turns out doing kind of the end-to-end in technology is really complicated. So we realized that in order to do this well, we had to do the end-to-end. This is something we learned at Apple. Apple does this really well. They have the iPod. They have iTunes. And they have this music store. And then the three work together. It creates an ecosystem, locks people in. At the same time, creates great user experiences. It's kind of the best of both worlds. Users win, company wins. It's kind of the best way. Did the same thing with the iPhone. iPhone, App Store, App ecosystem. It's freaking great. How many of you guys have iPhones? Case in point. Works. So given that premise, we wanted to apply the same thing to the home. So let's go build a great thermostat. Let's build great software for it. And let's build apps and services that go along with it. And it turns out that's a really big thing for a small company to take on. Like we thought that would have been pretty easy. Like Tony, I actually estimated that it was about six or seven people six months. And we'd probably get this thing launched. And it turns out we were off by about an order magnitude. And fortunately, we had some great investors. Some really fantastic folks. Randy Comus, our Kleiner Perkins helped us basically get this thing off the ground. And it's really nice to have investors who believe in you. I think, how many of you guys plan on starting a company raising money sometime the next year or two? Okay, so a few of you guys. So my advice to you guys is don't chase the money. The money is not important. You think about raising money? How much you raise is actually not important. You'll get term sheets. That'll happen. Well, at least in this economy it'll happen. What's more important is who you work with. And we were really fortunate that we worked with a partner who believed in us, who had worked with us, and honestly, we'd do anything to support us. So as we realized, oh shit, we got the plan wrong by an order of magnitude. We're going to need to raise our money. He was there to help us. It helped kind of evangelize us around the VC community to kind of get more folks involved. As we realized, holy cow, this may take a little more time than we thought, right there behind us. And as we needed to scale, to go from 30 people to 70 people to 300 people, we had a partner who was there with us. It was really nice. I wish that all companies had kind of partners and board members like that, not every company does. It was really tough though. It turns out every entrepreneur will apply to tell you that it's hard. And I think in this series, I think Ben Horowitz is the last speaker. And his whole stick is the hard things about hard things. It turns out they are hard. It's obvious, but there is no real way for me to even verbalize how difficult it is. As an entrepreneur, you are really on your own. Like yes, you may have a VC partner. But in the end, he's an investor. He's going to try to make a return. Fortunately, Randy was not one of those kind of guys. In fact, most entrepreneurs have VCs who are out to make a return. I had one co-founder. The two of us were literally on our own. Fortunately, we were really close. We call each other every morning. We still do. Every morning, A30, we get on the phone with each other on their way to work. And we talk about the things that were happening in our day. At the end of the day, we usually call each other in the way home and have the day go and what kind of things do we need to work on next. But really, you're very much alone. You're early in place. You're a team. They're with you. But being an entrepreneur is a very lonely place. And you may hear this from other entrepreneurs. It's very difficult. Things will go wrong. In fact, everything went wrong for us. And to the outside world, it looks awesome. We've done a great job getting this company launched, building momentum with our marketing, with our sales, with our product. But in fact, everything went wrong. Our initial plan was completely wrong. We had to rework that. Our launch plan. We were to launch in Best Buy Retail. That was our plan. Build the product, put it online, put it in Best Buy Retail is going to be great. Best Buy backed out the last minute. We had no retail. Fantastic. It was going to be great. But we worked through it. It turns out, when you have an attitude, when things go wrong, you say, let's just figure out how to make it right. And if you have a team culture where, when problems happen, people don't freak out and just figure out how to plan through it, things tend to go in your favor. So I think in terms of big lessons, things that I've learned is that surround yourself with a team that augments your weaknesses so that when things go wrong, you have your trusted counsel of folks who have all these different perspectives who could figure out solutions. It actually worked. To the point where we lost that Best Buy relationship in the early days, Best Buy is one of our strongest channels today. They turn out they learned. We got to come up with a different strategy. So let's put it online and see how we do. Turns out we sold out. That was great. Marketing worked. Turns out PR, also very valuable. People will tell you PR is the best means of early marketing and it's 100% true. It's essentially free. If you have something that's really cool and newsworthy, people will write about it. And when people will write about it, other people will talk about it. Really great. Really cool. So that guy is kind of out the gate. And we realized very quickly is we still needed broader retail. We need a bigger presence. How are people going to learn about Nest Prox? So we call it a bunch of different retailers to kind of get a sense of who would be interested in carrying this product. Most folks don't carry thermostats in retail. They're kind of folks who carry thermostats are like Home Depot and Lowe's. Well, we can sell there. Why not? They don't really sell consumer electronics. But if we could teach them that part, then maybe I could build a big business there. So we called both and Lowe's was kind of knocked off their chair. They loved this. And they, we started with Lowe's in a few hundred doors to kind of see how things went. And they went amazing. They went really well. We were selling several per store per week, which is a huge metric, by the way. Now people talk about growth metrics for companies these days. Millions of users are tens of millions of daily active. It turns out when you sell physical goods, a couple per store per week is actually a really big deal when you start the most play out. And we sell these growth numbers like we may have something here. So we started calling other partners. And we actually both a whole story about this. At the same time behind the scenes, myself, my team working on the next thing. Other lesson learned in Apple. Always be working on the next thing because chances are your competitors are going to be copying your first thing. It's still true, by the way. It's still true. Even today, you see like, you know, Apple announces iPhone 5. All competitors try to copy iPhone 5. Apple announces iPhone 6. All competitors try to copy iPhone 6. Good thing they're kind of always looking one step ahead. It's a huge good strategy. So we were already one step ahead thinking about kind of our next product. And then we announced a nest protect. A smoke alarm. Again, another kind of unloved product that no one cares about. But in fact, help save lives. Really important. And we realized that we actually started building this into a much greater vision. A vision we call the conscious home. The idea that instead of you hear about smart home, that's kind of a really geeky kind of thing. I may want a smart home, but I am not the general populace. My mom doesn't want a smart home. She just wants a home that works. Or she doesn't really need to be an IT person for a house. Or it just kind of works and lets her know when things are wrong and kind of anticipates her needs. That's what we built. We built it with two products. We built it with more products. Could we enable other people to build it in their products. That was the greater vision and we had reached the point of scale where we could start doing that. So, you know, we were off the races. We realized this could be a really big thing. At this point, we're about 300 people significant, significant revenue. And again, like the valley often is not known for revenue. Most startups kind of grow like this, but there's no dollars behind that, just users. We actually had a revenue curve like this. It's really good. One of those kind of things that investors really love. We're thinking like, how do you grow this to the next level? How much capital do we need? If we're going to be a thousand people with seven product lines and all these businesses and full kind of mass marketing, how are we going to fund this thing? And we realized we needed a really big round. And it turns out there are multiple ways of accomplishing this. And looking at all the options, fortunately, we had a really strong partner in Google. And they had stepped up big time to help us accomplish this vision. So Tony, I, about eight months ago now, decided to sell the company to Google. And this is not like in the classic kind of exit sense, is in the kind of entrance sense. And that I ready to take on the big guys. So when you're going, trying to grow a company from zero to a hundred billion dollars, there's a lot of steps along the way. And getting to your first hundred million, your first five hundred million, there's still a long way to go. And turns out Wall Street actually is very fickle. And they expect quarterly profits. And it's really hard to invest long term. That was all the advice we got from our advisors. So it was really fortunate that we actually could have the best of both worlds. That's what we ended up doing. So Nesta's now a part of Google that said we are a complete independent company. We are on the same path we've always been on, building the exact same product, the same vision. But with the resources of big company behind us, it's really nice. And really it's a kind of unique opportunity that most folks do not have. Kind of our next stage, kind of where we are today and where we're going next, is how we kind of reach the mass. And that is a very big challenge. There are very few brands, at least very few new brands, that reach mass. And I always say mass, I mean tens of millions, 50 million, a hundred million consumers. That is a massive, massive reach. And very few companies ever get there. The kind of brands you think of, like, of terms of mass brands out of the valley, like Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter. These are the very few kind of mass brands that are creating the valley. But we're trying to build one. And that is a mission that takes a long time. That said, it's something that we invest in. So when we invest in new products, we invest in the ecosystem, we invest in marketing. So you'll see a lot of marketing from Nesta's holiday season. Turns out, it takes actually mass marketing. PR only gets you so far. At some point you have to reach the mass consumer. Another kind of big lesson. Also, turns out you can't do it alone. And this is a realization that we only had, I'd say about a year ago, is it takes more than just our products to create an ecosystem. You really need to start bringing other people in. But there are very few brands that we thought kind of represented this conscious home vision that we wanted to go make. So we kind of we scoured the world. We talked to many folks. And we realized that we could create a team with Nesta to kind of help build them kind of in a greater sense. And we did that. We have more stuff coming there and more announcements in the next couple weeks about works with Nesta. But this is a very big mission. It's really exciting. And that's where we are today. It turns out like many people say, like, oh, has your life changed? Has your company changed? It actually hasn't. And part of what I've told my team is, like, we have such a strong vision ahead of us, it's just kind of a big world to go build. We have to go build that. And let's not get kind of clattered in the valley sense and the kind of inside base build that happens here. Let's go build a great company. And that's what we've been doing. So I am extremely informal as you've seen. Very off the cuff and very raw. But I would love to kind of take your questions and kind of, you know, how can I help you guys along your way. I've been in your shoes not that long ago. Sure, out front. So what more do I do to not push the thermostat inside of the applet itself to then, like, break out and make a company because applet is like all the resources to do? It's funny to say that. So the question is, is why did it not decide to build that thermostat back at Apple before I left? And it's funny to say that. So my boss at the time, who is running kind of the iPod iPhone division after Tony, asked me, he's like, why don't you build your startup with an Apple? And I said, well, it's going to take me a long time to get to a billion dollars in revenue. How much patience is Apple going to have to get to a billion? It turns out when you're making $50 billion a year, like, a $10 million kind of project, it doesn't really get them excited. And this is something that kind of represents the inertia of big companies. And something that I think keeps a lot of CEOs and boards up at night, and in all my conversations I've had with senior leadership at Google, is something that's very different about Google. Something that new things that may never pan out is not something that big companies do very often, which is why we had to do it on our own. There was really no way we could have done it with an Apple. Even now, thermostat may never be a $10 billion business. But it was definitely a key business that we saw to go build, then go build the next big thing, to kind of build it into something bigger. But that would have been very difficult to do with an Apple. To move the needle would have been almost impossible. Sure. You kind of walked us through the first few months when you came up with this idea. Did you immediately go to a VC and started pitching ideas to get funding? Were you working in the garage somewhere on your own with Tony? Or can you kind of walk us through that? So the question is, describe the first few months of NEST. And kind of, coming up with the idea through kind of the early days. So the early days of NEST were actually really unglamorous. I'd put it that way. So Tony and I met at Madera at Rosewood for lunch, kind of between his house and in my office at the time. And we kind of had our big brainstorm, like this is something we should probably investigate. Some we should definitely look at. And actually we spent six months investigating and looking. So very unglamorous. We did lots of late night Skype calls. We had a whole ourselves in kind of walled conference rooms and friends companies and just brainstorm and do whiteboarding and do internet research. Cold call experts, which is really funny thing like hearing. So Tony Fidel, guy invented the iPod. Now CEO of NEST, like cold calling experts at the EPA. He's like, hey, I have some questions about thermostat industry. And people actually asked in the answer. This was great. But it was really unglamorous. We did a lot of market research. We really wanted to kind of get it right before we said go. And before we started calling friends to hire them and before we called the VCs to raise money. It was about six months later we realized business is there. This is definitely a business opportunity. We could make a better product. It was clear like with our talents, with our skills, with our network, the products would be better for sure. That we could make a difference. That we could make a big enough difference. That was kind of our key metrics. And we could do it in a reasonable enough time. This is not something that would take three, four years to get the first product done. And once we had that, then we started pitching first employees. And we hired about 10, 12 folks in that early days to kind of build sketch prototypes, you know, prototype UI, first industrial design, build the first prototype early software, first app. At that point we realized like we had enough meat on the bones. We probably could talk to some investors. But we had the kind of, but then we talked to our first investor. We had full business plan. We had our go-to market which completely changed by the way. Plans do change. The key is just to have a plan, something, you know, something, a guiding force to push the team. Plans change. They guarantee they will. No one gets a plant run in the first try. But yeah, that's kind of the early days we're completely unglannery. We actually started the company in a garage. To pal out the real estate is really expensive as you guys are probably aware of. And given that we didn't raise money and didn't compare employees, we just basically worked out of a garage. And it was an amazing experience. Like if you ever had the opportunity to start a company garage, do it. It is amazing. We actually named our conference rooms at our now glorious campus down the street after some of the funny things we did in the garage like no squirrels like the squirrels were on the garage. Seriously, like the conference room called no squirrels because we used to have squirrels in the garage. Really, really super unglannery but really, really critical. You want to make sure that you believe in what you're doing. And that if you don't believe, like if you're not all in, if you're not a zealot for your cause, then for sure your first employees aren't going to believe you. And for sure you're not going to convince an investor. You have to have the kind of a whole picture. Other questions? In the back. Yeah, how does you think about crafting the culture at Ness? Were there elements in the culture that you practiced on the early morning or do differently when you started scaling quickly? So how do we think about crafting the culture? Do we emulate Apple or do we do things differently? A little bit of both actually. So it was a very intentional process. So Apple did a lot of things really well and they still do. Design. Best of the industry. Hands down, right? They do. I think so. They certainly do very well. Deep, deep technological integration. Thinking about the ends end. They do that really well. Marketing. They do really, really well. Team culture, we wanted to change some things. We were a startup. We're not a big company and we don't have Steve Jobs. So we knew we had to do things a little bit differently. So we decided to do something that was very unappled and to have a completely open transparent non-confidential culture in the company. It's an opposite of Apple, by the way. So back at Apple, I had teams working on iPhone, iPod, and iPad. And the iPad guys couldn't talk to the iPod guys, but what they were working on. albeit they were on the same team. So as you imagine as a startup, you can't really do things that way. Otherwise, your prock plan doesn't work. So that was a very early realization. Like we can't do that. Other thing we realized very early on is we're a small company. We're working in a garage. Everyone's in tight quarters. Probably can't hire any jackasses. Like you guys laugh. It's actually, it's a real thing. We still do it. It's one of the first things the first interviewer usually asks for candidates. Are you a jackass? And they always say no. But then we spend the next six, seven, eight interviews assessing how they really a jackass are not. As well as are they great at what they do. That's actually stuck with us. We realized that working in tight quarters, everyone's working together, everyone needs to work well together. But actually as companies grow, that's a really good thing to keep. So we don't, when you say company culture, we don't have like a, you know, these big plaques that you say like, this is what we stand for. Here's the five things that are core principles of nest. Like we don't have that. We have a vision of what we're building. And we have a great group of people. And that's our culture. The people we have are our culture. And the culture is more than just Tony and I at this point. It's hundreds of other people and a hundred other leaders. It's a really exciting. It's an amazing thing to go build. In the middle. How do you deal with collecting lots of data forward smart home? Are planning to go into hundreds of millions of homes? How do you deal with collecting so much data, especially in light of recent data breaches? So how do you think about data collection, especially as we scale? We think about it a lot actually. It's probably one of the biggest topics covered at the executive level in the company today. That new product development business, et cetera. Privacy actually, number one issue that we talk about. People are concerned about privacy and they should. The world has changed. And they said like we've grown up with technology. Our parents really didn't. It used to be that you'd have to get warrants for phone tapping, all these kind of things. The world has completely changed. Completely completely changed. And it's something that companies need to take very, very seriously. So I'll use the word transparent, but it almost doesn't even describe it. So we are very literal about what we do. So we have a privacy policy. Most companies do. But that's not what we expect people to read. So we have something we call privacy principles. We publish it on the web. It's something that I've talked about publicly many times. Guiding principles that guide basically how we do development and how we do our work and how we establish trust with the user. So for example, we don't sell information. That's not something we ever want to do. We don't share information. If we ever do share information on your behalf for your benefit, for example, linking your thermostat with your job bone. So you could have your heating and cooling system turn on when you wake up in the morning. That's your initiative. You're going to do that. And it's very clear what you do and why and kind of what data is exchanged and giving you the opportunity to close and shut that link down at any time. We let people delete their data and kind of let us forget that. And also, we don't collect data gratuitously. We do it kind of for their benefit and to give them new features. And what we've realized is if we're very straightforward of people and we stick to our guns and we do what we say we do, people trust us. And we give them lots of great benefits. And people like that, it turns out. They like great benefits. That said, it's still not for everyone. And as we've scaled, as we've kind of entered the mass, we've decided very discreetly, but we do talk about that you don't have to connect your devices. That you could build this conscious home without being on the internet, which is very controversial for most people in Silicon Valley. Like, holy cow, connect the device down the internet. That you could build this intelligence locally in the home and give people kind of control of their data. So that's something that's very real to us. That said, is always on our minds. And I think as you guys build companies or work at companies, it's something that you should think about too. And most companies, it's not on top of mine, but really should be. And I think it's nest opportunity as the leader in our space to kind of leave the chart here. In the back. Can you talk a little bit about the negotiation process when you sold your company? Negotiations process. So we didn't really, I think we didn't really negotiate. It's probably the wrong way we put it. But we only wanted to work with one company. There are very few companies in the world that invest in new areas that may never pin out business-wise, like Google. They think about like Project Loan, like these hot air balloons that give internet to kind of thorough world countries or people that don't have internet. Self-driving cars. Like these very bold initiatives. Google's willing to invest in those. And what Tonya realizes, that is the exact right place for us to go build nest. And we had the exact right partner in Larry. So obviously there's all the legal stuff and lawyers do their thing. But like we were committed. This is very obvious for us. It was not a negotiation. It was the best way to do an acquisition. Could you elaborate on, like I know you discussed your policy policy earlier. How that works with Google. Yes. So I know, good. So it has nest privacy policy work within Google. And the answer is completely separate. And it was part of the negotiations we had with Google. Is that yes, we were going to be a Google company, but not really a Google company. We have our own office. We have our own management team. We have our own culture. Our own data centers, our own privacy policy. And they agreed. It's the right thing to do. People's home is their private place. They should be able to keep that separate from their Google accounts. So we do. That's it. There may be cool integrations we could do. Or some, you know, there's things like Google now. As you're driving home, your house could kind of heat up on your way. But that's going to be your opt-in. It's something that you want to do. And you're going to Google.com slash nest and say, I want to link my account. And this is what's going to happen. I always get on like. It was something that we had top of mind. And something that we've always had top of mind. And that's one of the reasons why we're able to do the great things we do. Like, if we did nest again within a big company, kind of fully integrated it, we may not actually move as fast as we are now. Other questions? In the back. We talk about the importance of start off working on second or second or always the next product. We talk about why you chose the smoke detector, how that fit into the, how that makes sense is the next goal in getting the strategy of the contract. So questions about why smoke detector and why work on a second product? Like, why not iterate on the first? And I'll answer the second question first. We actually did iterate on the first. And immediately after launching, the first thing we did was get on the phone with kind of customers, our kind of early customers, early adopters here with their calling our call center about what they're sending emails about and fix kind of any issues they had. Before you scale, you want to make sure you're getting ahead of those. We even actually built a second thermostat immediately after launching the first one. We realized, oh, there's some things we could do better here. We have some customer feedback here. We should definitely iterate and fix there. But at the same time, we realized that in order to grow the business and the way we wanted to, we wanted to enter another vertical. And the way we picked smoke alarms is actually very much how we picked thermostats. So over looked product, everyone's got one. We can make a difference and we have the skills to make a difference. So we looked at kind of many products in the home. It turns out, number one cause of fire death, like why people die in fires at home is because they have smoke alarms, but the batteries are dead or they took the batteries out. That's retarded. That is a basic user experience issue. These things beep in the middle of the night. They're annoying. People hit them with a hammer or took the batteries out. And then they die. It's a really serious issue. And that's when we built the product. That's the whole point. That's why we did it. So like, how, why we built it? It was really that basic principle. It was that easy. People's got one. They're frustrated with them. We could do a better job. That's really how we did it. Other questions? Right. So did you always want to be in there and then after work and after work? Did I always want to be an entrepreneur? I actually never wanted to be an entrepreneur. From age five, I wanted to work at Apple. And even when I was five, Apple was a big company. And there was association with beautiful technology, things that just worked. If a child could use it, it's probably pretty good. And that was something that always intrigued me is building things that were really easy to use that a child could use. And I've always wanted to work at Apple. And still I have a ton of respect for the company and a ton of respect for the team there. But what I think I learned in Apple is that you could apply that same ethos, that same methodology, the same way of building things to other things. I think that's what we've done in asked. So I actually never, never wanted to be an entrepreneur. But I think some of the same skills it takes to build products, to build teams are the same skills to both companies. Where? How did you learn how to do market research? Had I learned how to do market research? Google. Not at Google, but using Google. Actually, I'm serious. Most of the early research tourney I did was like we would Google, like, thermos that market and see what it's like. Follow links there. And we say, oh, this is an expert. This guy at the EPA who did energy start for thermos, that's what we call that guy. So we call that guy, asking what he knew. And hey, is there anybody else we should probably talk to that you know? And he referred to this guy at Berkeley who did thermos that research and we talked to that guy. And he referred to some guy in Southern California who we call that guy. And we started building our network and learning about industry. And it's much like you'd probably do research for a project that's Stanford. Like you don't go to the library. You start calling people, you start basically doing the rounds. A lot of people have talked about the user experience on your products and design aspects. Beyond sort of you and Tony, is that something you explicitly hire for or something maybe you use structured teams in order to optimize energy creative. So how do you create great user experience? It actually is all about people. And yes, like Tony and I have a great user experience background. We build great stuff at Apple. But at our scale today, like we are the final editors of Winner Product Ships. We have a whole team of folks doing user experience today in industrial design and user interface design. We hire folks, we hire the whole spectrum. We hire things from people who are new college grounds that actually people who didn't even go to college, as people who are very seasoned. And what we look for is empathy. People who appreciate what users have gone through and can get themselves in a user's mind. It turns out when you build a product for yourself, it's not always the right product. And not everybody is a 30 year old male who lives in Silicon Valley. So it's actually really important that many people get this wrong. Build a product for your consumers and understand who they are. So we actually know who our consumers are. We actually have like, we've called eight profiles of people, like different families, different demographics, different age groups, children, no children, retirees, still working, big house, small house. And we put ourselves in their minds and in their lives and figure out what they need. And that's how our user experience is done. It's really actually, it's very empathetic. And then we hire great graphic and visual designers to kind of make that a reality. I think it's a little different than many companies do, user, either a face design. How do you define your revenge? If I want to become an entrepreneur, do I enter the market? Is it my own money or? How did we approach venture capital and do we put a lot of our money in? So yes, we did actually put a lot of our money in. Not only our own sweat equity and that no one got paid in the early days, but Tony and I basically funded the company for the first seven, eight months. Basically first year actually. Fortunately we were able to do that. We did okay at Apple. But when we approach venture capitalists, we started with people that we were one new, we're highly regarded, or people we knew already kind of knew and trusted. We did it based on our network. The key was we didn't call people. We asked people we trusted who they trusted. How do you do networking? It's actually really basic. Unfortunately, we had a network of people who knew people. But I'm sure you actually know people who know people. It's like you may not realize kind of how small the world is and how close everybody is together. And that's actually one of the things that's really special about Stanford and Silicon Valley. I bet one of your professors knows somebody at DFJ who knows someone at KP. There's in fact an amazing network here. So you guys probably are better connected than you may realize. So after looking back on this experience, the reference that there are many things that you learned along the way, and I think that making mistakes is probably the opportunity for actually learning the most important things. And I'm wondering, share your perspective, what is the single biggest thing that you will have learned from making a specific mistake? So what is the single biggest thing I've learned from my single biggest mistake? Wow. So a very, very deep question. So one of the earliest mistakes I made at NEST, it actually took me a long time to unwind. It was a hiring mistake actually. So when your team is small, like literally every single person matters. Every single person matters at 800 people. But actually every single person matters in order to magnitude more when you're five people. And whenever our first 10 employees, I knew well at Apple, I'd worked with them at Apple. He was an amazing, amazing engineer at Apple, who was always kind of used to working at a big company and was used to kind of all the resources, the big company behind us. And didn't adapt well to start an environment. And it took me a very long time to realize that. And a very long time to realize I had to get rid of them. And that was not an easy decision to make. It was one of my first times letting someone go. But it was actually really hard to do. And it was not hard to do in that, like I trusted him and he wasn't doing great job. But it was hard to do in that. He was intertwined with the rest of the company. And like, how do you extract that out? Like, when you have this group of 15, 20 people who are basically family, like, how do you send one of the brothers home? It's really hard to do. So when I say like, biggest mistake and biggest learning opportunity is higher very well. And that's not just based on your guts, but based on your partner's guts. Based on trust that kind of voice in your head. I actually had my own questions when we first hired him. Like, is this the right guy? Is he going to be all adapt? And I was like, he's a great guy. He's going to figure it out. And that took a bet and I was wrong. You can't always get it right. But I think the lesson learned here is not just higher well. But when you realize you've done it wrong, fix it. And it's hard to do. But actually, the sooner you do it, the better. So yeah, that's a no worries. Front. So you mentioned that in the beginning, in terms of business plan and strategy, you've got everything wrong in the beginning of the next years. And from our side of perspective, it's kind of a hard belief. I was wondering to the extent that you can talk about it. So if you could talk about some of the failure agent at the beginning in terms of business plan and how you guys went about it. So the question is, how did we get everything wrong, get everything right and we are really great at marketing. And I would say if there's things you could do well in a company building your brand and building your marketing team even when you're small, now you want to do it too early. But at the right time, with the right people, you actually have to do it. And actually, all two companies don't do this. All two may come to me, some do this either. So literally everything went wrong. Our first retail partner fell away. Our first product. We had a bunch of things we had to fix. We scrambled, we fixed them really quickly. We always made right with our customers that became our biggest advocates. We realized that the manufacturing center, there was building many of the parts, was shutting down and we had to move that to somewhere else. To the inside of the company, we were always behind. We were always struggling and we always got it wrong. And I think part of that also is our paranoia. And I think there's some truth to the old saying that the paranoid survive. If you're always worried about something could fail or if you're worried about the competition, that you may actually do something about it. And it's not good just to worry because when you just worry, it just keeps you up at night. Although everything pretty much keeps me up at these days. But if you're just going beyond letting it keep you up at night, if you actually do something about it. So actually one of the things that we did in our culture that is worth noting is we would start every board meeting and every all hands meeting with a slide about highlights and low lights. And we were transparent with our board and our team. Here are the things that are going really well and here are the things that are going really wrong. And for each of the things that are going wrong, what we're going to do about it. And we dashboard, this thing is red hot, we've got to fix this, he's the guy who's going to fix it and he's going to fix it by then. And here's an idea of how we're going to do it. And we're very tactical about it. Whatever earliest employees, Eric Cholten, employee number three, actually was a Stanford business student actually, said some things about like, in business school, they teach about strategy. And in fact, the business world is more about tactics. It's like 1% strategy and 99% tactics. So we were very good at tactics, I would say. Like being meticulous about the details. Not just about the design, but about everything we do. I don't follow up questions to my first one. It seems like you're a little non-traditional to your way of approaching investors. As a hardware company, you invest your money, you hired people before you even approach VCs. What was the reason behind that? What was, what was, you guys did that? So we had a very non-traditional start. We invest our money, we hire ahead of products. We did hardware actually and today people say, oh yeah, hardware sexy. It was not when we started, by the way. That said, we believed. And going back to what I said earlier about being zealous, we were zealous. And we still are. When you believe with everything you have, you're willing to do anything. And the earliest employees were willing to do anything. And we believed that this is the right product, the market needed it, and that we were able to make enormous kind of world-sized impact with what we were doing. So we pushed all in. And there was a point, late 2010, when I finally had $20,000 left to my name, which for a student may actually sound like a lot, but in fact, when you have a house, it was basically zero. We pushed all in. And it was something that we felt very strongly that we had to do. We had to build this company. And we're really glad we did. And the world is happy we did. And we're just getting started. So I want to ask you the last question. Sure. 10 years ago, you were a student. Yes. Did you learn 10 years ago when you were sitting in the seat? So I was a student 10 years ago in your chairs. What did I wish I knew? Don't be afraid, I would say. So one of the things that you learn, especially as an engineering student, is actually it's important to not to take risks, to think ahead. It's part of what makes engineers great, is that deep detailing. You're worried about this. We can't take risks. We may create a bug. We shouldn't push that new release out. It may disrupt the customers. It's okay to take risks. You should be measured with your risks. But sometimes opportunities present themselves that may seem completely world changing, that may change your entire life for the worse or for the better. But it's worth taking. And it's not something you could learn in a classroom, I think. But fortunately, you guys are actually able to sit in classrooms like this and hear people like me speak about some of their crazy stories. And hopefully, guys, go and change the world too. And there's enormous opportunities out there. And I really hope to see great stuff from you guys too. Thank you. Thank you.
