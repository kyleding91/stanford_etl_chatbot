 You were listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at edcorner.stanford.edu. So a quick introduction for our guest here. Many of you already know Professor Bob Sutton. He has been teaching here since 1983. I hope that's right. That's right. That is actually before I was born. Oh, sorry happening. He has won numerous awards which are in the handout today and he's a best-selling and prolific author. He's written more than 90 articles and seven books. His background is quite interesting and he gave me permission to say this in Heinskore. So whatever you want. Are you sure? Yeah, good. In high school he had a 1.9 GPA which is less than, is that right? No, it was after my junior year. Junior year. I raised it to 2.1 and my senior year. Pottery was very important in my grade point average. I'm not joking. So before pottery is a 1.9. That's correct. Which is less than half of what many of the students here had, I believe in high school. Less loves, yes. And then, so he went to junior college. He didn't quit on academics yet. And he told me that what inspired him to kick it up a notch was that his father was getting excited that he had such a low GPA in junior college as well. And because he was going to go, he was going to have to work for him if he couldn't get another job. Right? That's completely accurate, unfortunately. So he kicked it up a notch. He started making allays. He got with the exception I think only 1B. He made allays from there on out. Got transferred to Berkeley where he continued his A's streak. And then just right on through. And eventually got hired as a professor at the business school at Berkeley. And then jump ship 1983 to Stanford where he is today. Yeah, actually I started at Stanford. I went to Berkeley for a year. And then I quit. So both Tom and I are Cal alums. But it turns out that Stanford's a better place to work both of us having worked at Berkeley, right? Yeah, it's true. So let's talk about what we're here to talk about. The latest book is a best-selling book. It is on the name of it. And I'm only going to say this word once. The name of the book is the no-asshole role. And it is a best-selling book on number three on the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and number two on the business week. In fact, the New York Times said uses as its advertisement the title we can't print. And it shows a picture of the book and with a blackout over the word. So they're getting a lot of marketing out of that. So I want to actually, this is going to be an interview format. And I want to start on the subject of the title, in fact. And let's go at that. It's a bit provocative. That's a little bit scandalous. Well, I don't think it's that scandalous. So you want to hear why I'm using this dirty word. Yes. Well, Mike, so it is one of those things that I didn't actually mean to write the book. It's one of those things that evolved accidentally. So the way that it started was that I just wrote a little essay for the Harvard Business Review. It was called More Trouble than They Were Worth. And the main breakthrough idea was in the breakthrough idea section. By the way, none of those are breakthroughs. If you start looking at them closely, it's just a marketing ploy. And so I used the word there and got a lot of reaction to it. But the reason that I use the A word or the word that you won't say anymore is that first of all, let's face it, you can all remember it. My last book, which I think stills an excellent book, was called Hard Facts. Dangerous half-truths and total nonsense. I can barely remember it myself. So the No Ashtow Rule is a title that people can remember. The other two reasons, the first one has to do with my emotional reaction. So when I see somebody being nasty to somebody else, I don't say to myself, oh, what a jerk or what a creep. First I say to myself, oh, what an asshole. And then I censor. And then the last one is a self-control mechanism because one of the main ideas of the book. In fact, I think the last idea is that assholes are us, that all of us under the wrong situations are capable of being nasty. And when I turn into a jerk, I don't say, or I don't say, oh, Bob, you're being a jerk, I use that to self-sensor myself. So those are my various excuses. And some people are offended by it. Some people are not, but most people seem to remember it, which I think is a number and rule in marketing. Right? That's definitely the case. So how do you recognize a jerk? How do you recognize a jerk? So essentially, I mean, this is also one thing for all of you who are going to buy management books and write them in the future is if you can find an original idea, I want to see it. I actually have never seen an original idea. So a lot of the ideas in this book are stolen or borrowed from the literature on bullying or psychological abuse in the workplace. So if you look at that literature, there's two ways in which they approach it. One is the way that I approach it in the book, which focuses on the victim's perspective. So I focus on sort of two main things in the victim's perspective. Does somebody who does this, does it leave the person feeling de-energized and demeaned? And then the other approach is, and people who study psychological abuse do this, they sort of have long lists. In fact, there's some researchers in the East Coast have a list of 60 different ways in which you can abuse people. And they tend to break into different characteristics. One is sort of just abuse, yelling, screaming. The other approach is sort of political backstabbing. The third approach is sort of treating people as if they're invisible. So there's lots of ways in which jerks can do their dirty work. But I tend to focus on the damage done to the victim. And then the other thing, which is also, I think, very important. There's a lot of evidence that people who are demeaning, especially the workplace, they tend to, if you will, kiss up and kick down. So one of the main ideas in the book is that one of the better tests I have for you and being is how people treat people who are of less rather than more status than them. And so actually, there's a story in the book about Charlie Galunik, who is a graduate of our program, and now is, like I'm so old, that he was one of my doctoral students in Kathy Eisenhart's especially now, ahead of executive education at NCID is a full professor. But Charlie sort of the class, the kind of guy that he was on his way to interview for his Rhodes scholarship. Fellowship on its way from Kingston, Ontario to Toronto. And there was this older couple who were there, and Charlie got off and gave him a seat. He didn't know who they were, just Charlie's that kind of person. On the bus. Actually, at the train station. And then when he got there that night, it turned out that the event was hosted at the guys house. So I think that's the kind of person I think sort of qualifies as sort of the opposite. That's good, that's good karma. So by the way, the Kisep kicked down, I got that from the John C. Bolton hearings, where one of his former subordinates, a fellow Republican, called him a Kisep kicked down sort of guy. So this is in the congressional record, that's where I got it from. John C. Bolton was for those of you, you should know this, but who were, he was the United Nations ambassador who was not going to get appointed because he was such a jerk and then Bush appointed him in an interim break. Wow. So anyways. Well, one thing that might be relevant for a lot of people in this audience, we all know that there's definitely no jerk's at Stanford. But I would disagree with that, but that's okay. There's not a lot of them, but they're everywhere. Right. It's a bad joke. But when we're about to enter the real world, how can we deal with jerks, especially when they have more power than this? So this is what I was saying. So in the process of writing this book, I didn't want to become a doctor, feel like a character. But if you look at my email, I mean, every day I get five or six emails from people who have been feel oppressed. So the first thing, and this is actually old employment advice that I actually first heard in Tom Biers, STVP Semmon, the first Mayfield fellow seminar that was even called. I'm trying to, who is that guy who's from the law school who recently passed away? He can't remember either of the bookets. Bill Azir. So the first thing that Bill Azir said to us, I remember this distinctly, how long ago was this? Was this 11 years ago, Tom? Yeah. 11 years, I'm talking to Tom Biers with people on TV. So he looks at all the Mayfield fellows, and we call them the TVC technology ventures, something or another. And he says, remember, when you go to work at a workplace, you should look at the people you're going to work with very carefully because you're going to become like them. They're not going to become like you. So related to that, if you want to avoid being poisoned by a jerk or become one, when you need to roof your job, you should look very closely at the people you're going to work with. So that's my first advice is to avoid being around jerks if you possibly can. If you can't, there's a series of avoidance strategies you can use, or I guess coping strategy. The first thing is, and you've got to do sort of a power analysis, you should probably go and gently confront the person backstage. So there was actually one of my favorite emails. I got an email from a woman who described, and I'm quoting her, the major assholes she worked for because he was a retired US Army major. And she said he was very abusive. And what she did was she took him sort of like, you know, basically backstage and said, well, I'm documenting everything you do. And I'm not going to take the abuse of you anymore. And if you keep it up, I'm going to report you to HR. And she said that he went on abusing other people but not her. So sometimes polite confrontation works. The other thing, this is partly courtesy of somebody in the audience, is that I think that if you can't escape from people in the workplace, you should avoid them if you can. And there's a lot of evidence that you just avoid contact with the particular jerks as much as possible. So what I tend to do is I tend to have phone conversations rather than in person conversations with people who are jerks. I tend to do short emails with them. I would just avoid the contact if you possibly can. Those are some of the things that you can do. But the most important thing seriously, if you're in an environment where you're feeling constant psychological abuse, every employment lawyer and every HR person will say document, document, document. And I just had a great example of this. It was actually from a woman who's an animal control officer. And she described how they had a peer who was constantly making racist and sexist comments to all of them. And she went to her boss and her boss said, I can't do anything. And then what she did was she put together what she called the asshole diaries. She got her not co-authors, colleagues organized her fellow dog catchers. And they handed these signed journals into their boss describing this person's behavior, documenting the time and date. And they said three days later that the jerk was gone with no explanation. So that's, I mean, those are some of the things you can do. The book actually focuses more on how to build a jerk free workplace. But the fact is that even in great workplaces, many of us end up in this situation. Well, let's talk about that then. Is there such a thing as a good jerk? Do you need them at all? You know, if so, how does that work? Well, so the book actually has a chapter called, and I will quote myself, the virtues of assholes, so you don't have to say it. And if you went through research on how you get ahead in life, there are sometimes in places when being a jerk will help you. Like what? Well, for example, if you want to be viewed as more intelligent, there's a literature called brilliant and cruel. So if I said, well, Mike, you need to revise the script. That would not be a criticism. But if I said, actually, I heard this example recently, well, Mike, you need to revise this script. What did you do to take your stupid pills this morning? That would be an example of me personally insulting you. And if we get a controlled experiment, I would be viewed as less likeable but more intelligent by throwing in. Well, thank you for that. Throwing in insults like that. But so that's one reason. Another reason is anytime you're in an environment where intimidation is part of the game. So if it's I win, you lose sort of environment. And some of you will go into rewards systems where it's rank and yank and it's I win, you lose. And there's no incentive for cooperation. And those sort of environments demeaning and deenergizing, since that's what assholes do. Everybody's your competitor and you really want to win, then you probably should act like that. As a caution, I would warn you, after you won, you'll be at the top of a pyramid where everybody acts like that. So to me, that's the other sort of side of it that there's times when being an asshole can help you get ahead, but you're still an asshole and most likely you're going to be an asshole and infested environment. So when have you deliberately been a jerk? When have I deliberately been a jerk? So there is an argument for there's a lot of times when I've accidentally been a jerk. I should have lost. I do have a bad temper. It's not like I'm a perfect little angel. If we read the book, you will see many examples of me being an asshole. I can, and there's people who know me well enough in this room, especially Tom, who could document some. But I'm not lying. So one example was with Air France. Is anybody ever flown Air France? I've never flown Air Flot, but I think Air France is one of the worst airlines I've ever flown. I don't know what other people have their experience. But we had this situation where we kept trying to get boarding passes. In multiple cities, nobody would give us boarding passes. And finally, we were trying to move from one part of the gall to the other, the worst airport in the world. And there was 10 or 11 Air France employees. I was all of my whole family and everything. And none of them would pay attention to us. And we literally were missing our plane. And so finally, I said to my wife and kids, I'm going to start screaming at these people and being an ugly American and swear at them until they do something. So I started screaming and swearing at them and pounding and yelling and being the ugly American in Paris. And once they looked at our ticket, they realized they said, you're going to miss your flight. And I said, I've been standing here for 20 minutes. I've been telling you that but nobody will listen to me. So then I gave it over to my wife. She's a much more rational person. But honestly, if I were to replay that, I can't figure out anything else I could do because I believe I would still be standing there waiting for those Air France. And there was no line. They were all talking to each other. And that was one of seven or eight employees like that with their friends. So I don't mean to bash them, but they're my least favorite airline, actually. It sounds kind of like you mean to bash them. Yes, I do. So were you speaking English or French? English. I don't know any French. Mayor, I guess I know. Well, I know some of the wines. So is there any place within a normal organization? Maybe not one of these pyramids of jerks that you speak of. But is there any place within a normal organization where it's better to have jerks? For example, I don't know on the production line or my general view is that creating a climate of fear, although some people will have a delusion and believe it helps them on average, I'm like against it. And I think actually looked at the evidence that people who are nasty will get immediate results so they think it works. But if you look at the evidence, screaming at people, demeaning them, making them feel the energized, tends to drive them out of workplaces, tends to make them work less hard. They tend to lie and wait and put their energy towards revenge or their energy toward avoiding being stomped by the boss. So in general, I'm not for being a jerk even though there's people who will believe that it helps them. Now the other side of it, which is part of the air in our culture, in American culture, we are so obsessed with being a winner that we will let people be jerks and even say, oh, well, they win because they're a jerk when I would argue despite it and we let them get away with it. So two people I can think of. One is Bob Knight, who I think is an incredible jerk. I mean, honestly, most of you are Stanford students. I believe if I choked one of you and it was caught on videotape, Bob Knight is a basketball coach. He's a basketball coach. The winning is basketball coach and NC2A history. He's a Texas tech. He was eventually fired by Indiana University, but he was not fired for choking a student which you can go and find it on tape. It sure looks to me. I would say my opinion. He is choking the student. Honestly, I think if I choked one of you in videotape, I think that Dean Plummer is nice as he is would have me out so fast. It would be unbelievable. So there's lots of other people who the same thing seems to happen with Steve Jobs who has many wonderful qualities. But by all accounts, all published accounts, and I'm quoting Wyard Magazine is sort of well known for being a jerk. So from my perspective, we sort of let people get away with creating climates of fear once they're winners. And from my perspective, you're a winner in a jerk. You're still a jerk. And I don't want to be around you. And it's up to you folks who have jobs to decide whether or not it's worth it to you, but it's not worth it for me. Well, going along with that, do you feel like some of the qualities that makes somebody a jerk, such as confidence or service, can people get away from it? Would Steve Jobs be Steve Jobs if he didn't have a job? I don't care. I don't want to work for him. I mean, it is interesting because I've been invited to give a talk at Pixar. And we're trying to set the date. And I kept sort of bringing up the notion. So you know, I called Steve Jobs an asshole in my book. And they said, oh, that's OK. We have a jerk-free culture. And they wouldn't talk about it. So at least one of the organizations, he's now in 7% of Disney and they're part of Disney that he's the major shareholder in, like, believes in having a jerk-free culture. So if you don't want to go to Disney World someday. Well, actually Disney is a pretty nasty place. Those of you who should know this, this is way pre-job. So I actually have a bunch of realtors in entertainment business and there's a great joke they tell in Los Angeles that there's three homeless people standing by the side of the freeway. And LA, one has a sign that says, well, work for food. The other one says, well, work for money. And the last one said, well, work for Disney. Disney, you start reading the published accounts as a nasty place. As nasty as? It's funny. It's the happiest place in the world, too. I'm in discrete. I, by the way, you know, it's like, well, I don't actually kind of like Disney, but I've never worked there. Oh, yeah. It's a nice place to visit, because they do. Through fear and intimidation, they create the happiest place in the world. OK. So going along with that, except not, earlier you were mentioning that Dr. Phil, you have sort of a Dr. Phil approach now, or you've become Dr. Phil. No, I'm trying to avoid becoming Dr. Phil. Have you gotten a lot of feedback? But a lot of people have been asking you for a second. So I get counseling. I get, I could show you my email. I showed you some of them, actually. I get 10 or 15 emails some days, some days, five emails a day where people asked me for help in various ways. So just yesterday, just two examples. This is just yesterday. I got one from a woman who described in maybe a thousand words, all of the ways in which her boss abused her and other folks. And she was asking, which strategy should I use? And so I'm very careful to both say, well, I'm not Dr. Phil. That's the term I use. I'm not Dr. Phil. And I don't believe that Dr. Phil can cure those people on television in 20 minutes, either it's just for ratings. But you might want to see employment, or you might want to document. So that's one approach. But I got a new one yesterday, which was somebody asked me, and this guy said, we're in a family own business, my son and I are both assholes. Can you help us? So this is like a first. So I actually know a number of clinical organizational psychologists. And I referred to them because I looked them up. They were like a real company, like a pretty big publicly held company. Not fortune 500, but pretty big. And so I warned the person I referred to, so this person is very high rates, but is worth it. And it sounded like they needed it. So that was the, just since we met Friday, just since last Friday, I've got like a new sort of form. On Friday, you were telling me about when you had that week, or maybe it had been a little bit earlier about a preacher in Texas. I'm from Texas, so that had special interest to me. But he was trying to decide if the rule was appropriate in his church. Oh, yes. So first of all, that's the biggest, one of the biggest surprises in the book is it has a sturdy title. And I thought some Christians probably are offended by it. But there's a little group of vehement Christians. So there's one guy who writes a blog that is about teachings in the church. And he described how he used the no-ascal rule in church to teach Corinthians one. And so that thing is like love is patient, love is kind for those of you like me who wouldn't know what Corinthians one was till now. And he used this to lead a Bible study group in class and he read from the no-ascal rule. I'm not making this up. You can find it in this blog. And so his conclusion was that Corinthians one means don't be an asshole. That was one case. And then there was another one I got from a Catholic priest just recently. This may have been since we talked, who thought that they should use it in seminary training, because assholes are a problem in the world for priests because they have trouble parishioners. They have trouble with other priests. So it's like that. So I get the weirdest email I've ever had. And before this, by the way, I used to be a normal business management professor. So I still don't quite know what I've got myself into in some ways. So clearly you've seconded on a nerve and something that a lot of people can relate to. You were also telling me about what it was like to release internationally. Which countries, did you have the easiest translation problem? Which did you have the hardest? Oh, it was kind of funny. So I actually don't speak a lot. So the French version, which is actually selling very well, they translate in France and it's doing well and everybody's very happy with it. In German, they're Ashlach Factor. It's also sold well in Germany. It's sold 40,000 copies. And that just means the asshole factor. But the biggest translation problem I had was with the United Kingdom. This is true. And I tried to convince them that in the United Kingdom, they don't use the word asshole. They think that's a part of the body. Only they use the word arsehole. And so I had this big argument with my publisher that they should call it the no arse rule and they refuse to do it. And then I've gotten three or four reviews in England, like in the paper and stuff that's say nice book, but why did they call it arse? So I suggested that they release like a de-Americanized edition where they cross out asshole and put an arse. I thought that would be a good PR stunt. They wouldn't do it. Which is another thing about the publishing business is that it's the most conservative business. It's like they're having trouble, but it's a business that deserves to have trouble. They are so stuck in the past. They're even worse than the music business, which most of you know about. Well, earlier you said that perhaps it's best not to have jerks around, but then in your book, you also mentioned that perhaps one is a good idea. So what is one having one jerk around? So this argument, which by the way, is, so there's some arguments in the book that are empirically tested. This is like the professor sort of has a fantasy, so I would warn you about this one. But there's a large literature on deviants. And what the literature on deviants shows, especially around performers, if you want to have a real high performing group, it's probably better to have a group where everybody works hard, except for one or two bad examples to show everybody how not to behave. And in fact, if you remove the bad examples, the performance of the group tends to go down a little bit. So if you apply that logic to assholes having one or two token assholes around who are probably lower status and lower power, will be like the bad examples to show everybody how not to behave. And I don't know whether I completely believe this, but there's some literature on tokenism and on deviants that show that you might want to have. Should you promote them to keep them in the company? I don't know. I think they're naturally occurring at a high enough rate, but I don't think you have to worry about having a few around, frankly. So let's say you're a really small company and perhaps many people here might start a small company. And you find out that early on, one of your core members, maybe your first four, six, ten people, is a huge jerk. What can you do about that? Fire that they're like a child? Well, that's my first reaction, my first, but in general, so my argument is, and there's a number of people that's been involved in startups, or this was the case, that there's an argument that in fact, the best way to keep them out is to set it as an early norm. So in fact, there's a company called Success Factors. And I think Tom was on the board that sold the intellectual property to what became Success Factors, right? What was the name of that company? Austin Haye, but my wife called it Lost in Pain. Lost in Pain? It's also funny whenever Tom's involved with a failure, he can't remember it as well. He's got a really good, which is actually very healthy, by the way. So anyways, so this guy, Lars Dahlgard, who's all 39, and he's a graduate of the business school, he describes himself as a recovering asshole, by the way. So he became CEO of Success Factors, which is funded by a combination of venture capital and private equity. And what he does, and he's been there since I've had about 15 employees, is that he has a no assholes rule. And he doesn't just have it. He has these 14 rules of engagement that every new employee has to sign that says that they won't be an asshole. In fact, what it said, at least until very recently, was it's okay to have one. It's not okay to be one. And that's like in your formal rules of engagement. By the way, Success Factors, and it isn't just because of the no ass rule. They have some other cool product. So the product was good. It just needed to go on the web. It's the fastest growing software company, over 30 million. They woo from 100 people to 400 people this year. So they're doing very well. And Lars is great because Lars goes on national television. He says, I'm a recovering asshole. He shows people the contract. I mean, he's totally explicit about it. And then he blows it sometimes. The first time I met him in person, he said, last week I had a bad week and I started yelling at some people in the staff meeting, which is, by the way, if you ever have been in a startup or will be in a startup, yelling at people in the staff meeting is not unusual behavior. If it hasn't happened to you, it will. But the difference is that Lars said there was eight people in the meeting, but he knew that word would get out that he broke the no assholes rule. And he wrote a note of apology to the entire company. So I think this is an entrepreneur who's serious about it. Another example, I have all these like email buddies. Another one is a guy named Lou Pepper to change industries. Not only for you to have Washington Mutual, the bank that's, so I've actually in Microsoft, in Seattle giving a talk to Microsoft about the no asshole rule, which by the way, I'm just repeating what they said, they said they need to apply the no asshole rule in Microsoft. I'm just quoting their employees and I was not a non-disclosure so I can say that. So anyways, so I get this email from the sky, Lou Pepper. He was CEO of Washington Mutual in the 80s and he said that was the rule they applied in hiring there. So it is possible. So I don't know whether it made them more effective, but it is possible to have an effective company that applies the rule. So this whole time we've been talking about it as somewhat binary, you either are or you're not. Is that really the case or do all of us perhaps act like that at times and how can we control that? Well, I mean you're talking about more. I think that, I mean this is one of the main ideas of the book is I, so there's something in psychology called the person situation debate. You probably all had introduction to psychology and were subjected to the person situation debate. And if you look at most behaviors, including a more aggressive behavior, it looks to me that like about 20% of the action is some personality. I'm characteristic and 80% the situation you're in. So to me the two main things that turn people into assholes are one being around aggressive people. So if you're, it's a contagious disease. There's a literature on emotional contagion. And this is back to Bill's ears point. If you're around a bunch of jerks, the odds are you're going to become one and start acting like one. And then the other thing is I think that when many of us are under pressure, you know, time pressure, criticism, whatever that I think that it tends to come out. One thing I would also say with all due respect to Silicon Valley and tech company norms, this is probably is prevalent in this industry is anyone I've ever seen. It might be worse, but not many are worse. Okay. Well, would that be a deterrent for people seriously considering working here and perhaps more generally, there are enough people listening to this. Maybe, you know, is there something that as a community that Silicon Valley could do to well, I mean, if you look at Silicon Valley, like we've got like a lot of the characteristics that are going to lead to aggressive behavior and having people in bad moods. So if you're not a people in bad moods, well, what do you do? Put them in an eye when you lose game. That sounds like a lot of Silicon Valley environments. You have them work ridiculously long hours, being tired as one of the best ways to make people grouchy that I've ever heard of. Maybe you criticize them in public. So there's a lot of Silicon Valley norms. The other thing about Silicon Valley firms is, and there's actually, I read a great blog posting for a woman named Penelope Trunkey yesterday when she was describing the problem with Web 2.0. It was Web 2.0, our all companies like Google, where you work 16 hours a day. And so how are you supposed to have a personal life in a situation like that? I had a Stanford, and Google is a really civilized place. I'm a huge fan of Google. They have the don't-be-evil stuff, and they'll tell you it's not efficient to be an asshole there. But I mean, if you have an environment where you never go home, I mean, that sounds pretty stressful to me. It's easy for me to say, but maybe people ought to calm down a little bit. It's a pretty nasty environment out there these days. OK. Well, in a few minutes, we're going to open it up to questions. So I'd like it if everyone could start thinking of some so that I don't hog it all. And I love obnoxious questions. So go for it. The more obnoxious the better, obnoxious, the more fun that way. OK. Well, I don't have a particularly obnoxious question for you right now. But perhaps I'll try to find a contradiction here in your two books. Good. And in the weird ideas that work, he has two chapters, one's called, hire people who make you feel uncomfortable, even those you dislike. It seems like a lot of jerks would fall on that category. And then encourage people to ignore and defy superiors and peers. And defy seems like a very confrontational word to me. So how do you reconcile the advice in this book with the advice in this book? Well, to me, there's a difference between being... So the question, it's actually a great question. And by the way, I've been taking a task for this like in a number of places. The first thing is that I promise no consistency in my writing. I just tend to like what sort of like. Or you know, it's hard to be consistent in life. So Jim Marche, who's one of my favorite and retired Stanford faculty members, talks about consistency is overrated. And so I could sort of go down that path. But I will still try logical reconciliation. So to me, there's a difference between being different. So one of the main reason I said is to hire people who make you squirm, even you dislike. There's a lot of evidence that, and this is called homosocial reproduction or the similarity attraction hypothesis, that human beings automatically and naturally dislike people who are different than them. So from years of teaching or trying to teach diversity in the Stanford classroom, I would sort of ask, well, what about the black, white thing? What about women versus men? In the two things that people, Stanford undergraduates would say they fought over, what is they hated people from Berkeley? I heard that. So how do you like that? We get that. And the other one was in the dorms. And I don't know where this rings true. The tension between the techies and the fuzzies. In the dorms. So the one people in the dorms know this. Was one of the biggest sources of tension. So this notion that you naturally and unconsciously have negative reactions to people. There's an argument that those people who are different than you might have different knowledge. So maybe you should bring them in. Now, the other thing about ignoring defy superiors, there's a lot of evidence that when you look at the most creative companies, they tend to actually openly encourage ignoring and defying managers in a sort of, sort of like painless way or sort of civilized way. So a great example of this is Amazon. So Jeff Bezos gives an award every month for employees who do stuff without asking for permission first. So in a creative environment, and this goes back to 3M and Google actually now has a set of rules like this too, in a creative environment that allowing people to act independently without checking with the boss first. To me, that's different than when you defy the boss saying to the boss that you're an idiot, I hate you, you're useless. So to me, it's gotten more to do with the personal insults or ignoring people and treating them as if they're not human beings. So there's a lot, there's a difference between sort of creative friction and just sort of treating people like they're dirt. So I'm really focusing on like, let's at least, there's some people talk about happiness and likeability. I'm trying to sort of cut out the bottom 10%. So let's at least get rid of the real nastiness and organizational life because in the end, we're going to die anyways when we're going to place where people are so nasty. Okay. Well, with that, we'd like to transition to some Q&A. Oh good. So just remember not to be nasty? That's the... Oh, you can be nasty. It's more fun. But I'll try to be point. Okay, be nasty and don't be nasty. Whatever you want. There's the advice here. That's right. And I do have a few more questions. If at any point it's slim pickings, but I'm going to try to repeat it after you ask. So if anybody has one, right here? All right. Okay, so the nice way of asking is what do you do or what does strategy the research? And that's the way that it's asked if you can do anything or just to deduct. Oh, so that's a great question. So the question is like, how did I write a book on assholes? Well, well, first of all, the way it started, so this actually something I should have covered, is that I didn't mean to write a book on assholes really. I wrote this 800 word essay for the Harvard Business Review. And the basic argument was, it was not very complicated. It was. You shouldn't hire them in the first place. Don't let them get away with it. And to Mike's point, maybe one assholes better than none. But the amazing thing was the day loose of email I got. I got 300 emails in response to that one little article. And so I realized there was a nerve out there. And so what I did was, I guess what I always did do is I reviewed the academic literature and psychological abuse on workplace culture, bullying, and sort of piece that together. I talked to everybody I knew about it. I thought of the experiences in my own life. This book is a much more personal book than my other books. And then I had those zillions of emails. So I can't even remember what's in the book and what isn't. I just get just this constant sort of day loose. And I can't believe how long they are. So that was one of the things that's, I think I've written four times as much on my blog about assholes and I have in the book because it just comes in. And a lot of times it's just cutting and pasting the email and putting it in the blog posting and say, look at this. So one thing, one thing to this point Mike didn't ask about is the most viral thing I've done. So viral marketing is a big thing. Viro marketing is, I work with Guy Kawasaki who's been at ETA. How many times has Guy been at ETA? Probably at least twice. At least twice. And Guy is like, so in the book there's a 24 item self test. And we put it on Guy's blog and he renamed it the ars test, the asshole rating self exam. And so almost 90,000 people have taken it. And that's like, if you know Guy's sort of brilliance for viral marketing, that's a lot of it. But it's, some books, it's like I had a force and stuff. It sort of feels like I wrote this little essay and then just have been on this ride. So it's really been pretty weird. So in terms of doing the research, I did sort of what I always do, but I did less of it, I would say. Because this book is one fifth as long as my last book, by the way. So it didn't have to be so long. That was the only thing that I learned by the logic of my lesson, my next book should be 50 pages long and have an even more extreme obscenity on it. If I want to sell more books. I'm not sure I'm going to go there. But so it's very easy to research. And Tom Cosmic was actually indirectly in the book. He's got his hand up. I'm the asshole on page 17. No. And he sold the movie rights. No. No, no. No, no. It's like, I've got these literary agents. I've got like a real literary agent. My literary agent is 70, 6 years old. And he's a rookie literary agent. He's done like, his first book was weird ideas that work. But he was CEO of WWNorton. Before that, his name's Don Lamb. I think I may see him tonight. And so, you know, it's like they sell what they can sell. I mean, that's just the way it works. But I actually think having seen the office, the office is so good, I don't think it's actually necessary. I mean, that's one of my favorite TV shows. Is there a kind of a YouTube phenomenon that you could get people to do video to asshole? Sounds like a great idea. I think it would be totally interesting to see people or assholes in different parts of the world. So, quick, a quick plea to the audience and to the, you know, 10,000, 20,000 online listeners, please send all of your videos of Jerks or worse to Bob. Yeah, no, I'll take them. So, there was the song, Assault by Tom Leroy, I think. So, I actually have that on my blog. It's like his incredibly funny song. But, yeah, if you go, it's funny because I tune Sensor Them. So, if you put an asshole, you get all these A-star, star, star things back. But you'll get a lot of songs. And that? In your research, did you come across situations where corporations are institutionalizing assholes? Oh, yeah. I think that's the single of power. And did you also come across situations where this bad behavior is also coupled with criminality? Well, the criminality, I mean, repeat the question. Oh, so the question, why don't you repeat it since I can, yes. Are there times at which being a jerk is institutionalized and is this associated with criminal behavior? The second part to me is more like a high, if you sort of read histories of Enron, I think that looks to me like it might have been associated with criminal behavior, but it might have just been independent. But, I mean, certainly, and this was sort of like Mike's earlier question, which was a great question. I didn't answer it. Like, is it a linear or nonlinear thing? There's sort of a continuum of companies. There's some I'm not actually going to name. But I'm thinking of sort of like law firms and hospitals or especially nasty places, where it does tend to be institutionalized, especially by the way in surgical training. There's a lot of nastiness. If you look at surveys of surgeons, they're one of the nastiest occupations around it, especially in surgical nurses, it's amazing how much grief they take. So there are some places more institutionalized, but to me it's sort of like a continuum on one end. You've got hospitals and some law firms I can think of. There's one law firm that I worked with. I wouldn't use their name. I gave a talk there and when I went to, when I went there, I thought they all hated me. Because every interaction I had with them, somebody would personally insult me. And finally I started watching them interact with one another. And this was the norms in the law firm. And I've since found out about law firms. This law firm was especially famous for this kind of behavior. And towards the beginning of my visit with them, this is to your point about being institutionalized, the way a guy described to me is, we used to be a nice law firm where there was a balance between economics and humanity. Now we're a mean law firm where it's all money all the time. So to me that sounds like it's institutionalized. But then there's other organizations. I mentioned success factors. Google, I gave a version of sort of like a more formal talk of Google. And I kept pushing them. I said, so what about this don't be evil thing? And they said, well, you know, we hope it lasts, but this is a place where it just isn't efficient to be an asshole. So there is a range of possibilities. And it almost adored the gate of being this bad character. And those sort of synonymous with saying, you know, nice guys finish last. Even though there's lots of evidence that a nice guy's finishing into this point to go back to the law firms, there was another night, there was another law firm I spoke at just about three weeks ago. And the guy who was head of the law firm. So this law firm is in the top 40 in the AMOI 100. So that means that the average partner is making about a million dollars a year. So this is like a million dollars a year, probably most of you, at least now think you could live on a million dollars a year. And when you wanted to buy the house in Atherton, you decided that a million dollars a year isn't enough in the local insane mentality. But they had actually a famous law firm consultant in, not any of the brand names like McKinsey or anything like that. And the consultant advise them, and I'm quoting, this is sexist and asshole, this, you need more big swinging dicks. That's the only problem I can see with your law firm. So there's some professional consultants out there actually giving that advice. And as the guy, they had a law firm said to me, this is a really nice law firm. And we actually like hiring women. So by those two standards, it's not going to work. So there are people to your point about nice guys finish last and all this stuff. There are people who are reinforcing the stereotype and being paid well for it. Awesome. Kimber. Can we first give this asshole a little bit as a piece of it? Because if they need bad things, they just need to have some samples. Maybe we'll actually cut some of these for a couple of years. Oh, I've got lots of examples. The question is, there are specific cases in which it has, being a jerk has caused losses. So chapter two, which is on the damage done. So we didn't talk about that in formal detail. Goes through a whole bunch of ways in which being assholes cost money. It's very well documented that workplaces have higher levels of abusive supervision, have much higher turnover and more trouble recruiting. But I'll give you a specific example. So the end of chapter two has a list of the total cost of assholes. And so I was talking to a local Silicon Valley executive about all the ways in which assholes my cost company. And he said, well, that's not just hypothetical to us. We have this guy named Ethan. That's not his real name. Who's one of our star sales people? And he's abusive. So he writes flaming emails. He screams at people. One of the things that was especially upsetting the people in HR is both. He had repeatedly called people at HR about reimbursements they were having trouble they were having from their health care organization for less than $10. This is somebody who was making a couple million dollars a year. And so they got so upset at him that they put together the cost of all of the things that Ethan did. The secretaries he burned through. So he not only burned through a couple of secretaries a year. So in this case it was only one secretary. No secretary in the firm would work for him. So they always had to go outside and get somebody else. And then they had explained to every secretary so there would be some hope that he or she would say how they were going to be treated. And they have to pay that person more money. There was a time spent by HR. There was a time for anger management. They were training. There was also the litigation costs. So there actually are a lot of costs. And to this point I spoke at an employment law firm called Litler Mendelssohn, which is the largest employment law firm in the country. And there's sort of a movement in the American law. It used to be that if you were a jerk but weren't sexist or racist you could probably get a right way with it. But there's increasing signs of being an equal opportunity jerk or somebody who treats everybody like dirt. May actually be an unlawful offense. So there's legal costs. The legal costs are likely to grow. So there's lots of costs. The other final thing is the Google effect. So many of us in this class know one of the happy things is that the job market is pretty good. I mean I'm hearing from Sanford soon just pretty good. And Google because of their don't be evil approach sort of sets a standard of a lot of tech companies I know are scrambling to try to be nicer so they can compete with Google. So there's also a war for talent element to this which we haven't talked about. But I love the Ethan story because what happened was HR got mad. And so the guy from the company showed me the report like they put together. So this is another total cost of assholes. So the people of HR spend three days putting together a report documenting all the nastiness. So that's another cost because HR employees usually have a lot to do. So be conscious of your TCA. Your TCA. Right here. And the orange hat. I'm not ready to book yet. So I'm not sure the context was earlier you're talking about avoiding the problem by talking to people on the phone and short emails and so. And so getting with your book but going back to your background of psychology. That seems like one of the worst ways to deal with the problem. That's when I get any other thoughts. So so that solution is not very good. So the question is, is so I suggested that if you can't escape from the assholes you're working with. To do all you can to sort of limit the power of their venom and how it affects you. So if you can't get out you can't stop them from doing it. You're not sort of willing or able to get HR or other people to go after them. There's an argument that for sort of short term control. That you might want to do stuff like like have like telephone calls instead of face to face meetings with them. Schedule really short meetings. Another thing there's actually an interesting literature on this about stand up versus sit down meetings. There's a little academic literature that if you stand up rather than sit down the meetings aren't any less effective but take about 35% shorter. So if you can't get an argument maybe for removing the furniture from your office or something or go into a conference room where you don't have to talk to the person. But I agree that all those are really bad strategies for people who are stuck in a situation where they're just trying to cope with it. Which is why I always tend to say if you're in a situation where it's that bad, probably the best thing you can do is start looking for another job. Which is another way by the way to avoid contact with your nasty workplace. You can spend time looking for a job. I need to talk about revenge strategies. The other thing is ways that people get control is by doing explicit and implicit revenge strategies. So this feeling of control is very important. And two strategies I heard of one was the X-Lax revenge strategy. Which was there was this woman and she's in the book. She was a producer for an NPR radio station. Her boss kept stealing her food off her desk. Which is sort of like a power thing. People take food from you. They order for you. They eat off your plate. Some of this is like the people in my family actually. Reminds me of. But this woman had this trouble where her boss kept eating her food off her desk. So she made candies out of X-Lax and put them on her desk and he ate them. So I thought that was a pretty good revenge strategy. But all those are bad. The best thing to do is to eat out. E-tail does not officially support that. No, I don't support them either. But I mean the fact is that if you're in an environment, this is any stressful environment. Where if you can't control the main cause, controlling the way you get stressors and avoiding them as much as possible. And also one other thing that I'm a big advocate of which is also suboptimal is learning not to care. So you know all the organizational culture stuff you should have passion. You should really care about what you're doing. I'm an advocate of when you're in a situation where people are treating you badly. Just learn the art of emotional detachment. I told this to Randy Comissar who's probably been in ETL too in the last year with Deborah. I told him to rant and he promised her he claimed this was very Buddhist but I didn't know that learning not to care. So there's an art. Is that Buddhist? The part of Buddhist is that you're in your equanimity or in the tech. So that's a little different than the organizational cultural problem we get though isn't it? I like to love your assholes too. I hope that you're getting it. So Tom Cosic said you should learn to love your assholes. That's the way they dissipate it. Oh that's good. That's deep. I'm sorry. We have time for one or two more questions. And right over here to read some of them. I'm just going to talk about the concept of jerks and off-limits. How they do, maybe in a different volume on topic. Oh, so nonprofits are terrible. How did jerks exist in nonprofits? So I get a lot of emails from nonprofits. So one of the nonprofits are kind of like academia. Where with all due respect to us the problem is. And also hospitals is that the people in charge aren't really in charge. So I'm not like the biggest believer in authority but when you have a whole bunch of medium people with medium power. It's like they all start button heads against each other. So actually sustaining cultural control in a nonprofit is even harder than in a for-profit organization very often. So you really actually have to be careful of it. So I get a lot of emails. One place is even worse are actually elementary schools because you've got a situation where you've got like a bunch of heavily unionized workers. And you've got management who has limited control over them. So nonprofits are very tough. Okay, another question. Teresa. You talked about some obvious forms of jerks. Are there some more subtle, serious forms that people might be on the whole campus? So Teresa asked is it all explicit? And in fact, so this is one of those things that I'm actually in the middle of a long blog post about this. So Teresa asked good question. And one of the most insidious things is this notion of treating people as if they're invisible. So I actually got this incredibly articulate rant from a local legal secretary about all the ways that the partners in the law firm treat her like dirt. And the one she complained about almost most vehemently was what are the partners who she would work with over email. And you know, she do 20 emails a day with this guy and every time he walked by her desk he would treat her like she was invisible. So that idea of treating people like they're invisible is one of the worst things. That's one of the reasons to go back to Berkeley. Why left Berkeley is that that's seem to be the norm. Either you were nasty to other faculty members. You treated them like they didn't exist. Tom's nodding his head. So I say it's actually a reasonably civilized place. Sorry Tom, I didn't get you in trouble. Okay. Go bearers. Okay, last question. Last question. Tina. Tina. So the success of this book would indicate that there's a pandemic of apples. So have you found any cultural differences that there are some places in the world that it's that this is more prevalent than others? So the question is there's some places in the world more prevalent. So the best data I have is actually on the regional differences in the United States. So it turns out this is very well documented across studies including a recent national sample. The nastiest people in the Northeast. The nicest people are in the South. And sort of Midwesterners and Californians are pretty nice. But if you look at it. So I saw this at a national probability sample of 7-11. And also this recent sort of this poll of abuse of supervision, which is just a few months old. So that's the place I know the best. The other thing although I'm no expert in it is that one of the reasons my German publisher says the book is sold so well in Germany. Is it's a he keeps claiming it's a problem in Germany. And it's also sold very well in France. So that's just my perhaps stereotype. Okay. Well, thank you. Thank you for coming. Thanks a lot. Thanks.
