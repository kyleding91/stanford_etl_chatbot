 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series. Brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Alright, so I'm going to minimize all that introductory talk. I'm going to minimize the introduction of Steve Case because you've heard it before. He's chairman and CEO of Revolution Partners Now. But before that he had an old gig called AOL that really was the precursor to the internet. A tremendous icon in computing and online services and just technology here in the United States and around the world. His bio is up on the site like we always do and he has great philanthropic background. But without further ado, because he's come so far to me with us from Washington DC, let's welcome Steve Case. Good afternoon. Good to see all of you here on the Stanford campus and Entrepreneurship Week is terrific. I'm also here for Stanford Parents Weekend. I have a freshman who happens to be the audience but I'm not going to call her out and embarrass her. But I would like to get started by having everybody stand up for just a minute. Just make sure you're awake. You can do this. I'm going to take a little picture of you here. Yeah, I am. Alright, you're not that good looking a group I must tell you. Alright, here we go. Alright, got the picture and now I'm going to tweet it. So you're going to be live and then it's also going to update my Facebook page. So all of you, at least this side of the room, I don't have this iPhone. Yeah, super wide angle lens. We'll now be live. I told Tina Cee like I'd help promote Entrepreneurship Week and I just did. I'm not a lot of fun with Twitter, lightly posting messages from time to time. But I must admit there's some people including my daughter that are a little annoyed because I have my Twitter feed automatically connected my Facebook page. And so she says with all the postings I've got, I'm kind of overwhelming her news feed. And she's threatening to unfollow me or unfriendly, I should say. But of course I think she's a little worried about that because you might think I will unallowance her. Anyway, Entrepreneurship Week is a great thing. It's a terrific time for Stanford. But it's particularly important I think right now. As you all know, our country is struggling a little bit. Sort of an economic malaise, if you will. And there's only one thing that's going to get it back on track. And that's innovation and risk taking and entrepreneurship. There's a lot of things that can be done and are being done in Washington DC, which is where I live. But ultimately, there's only so much the government can do. It really requires the private sector and particularly requires entrepreneurs. As you all know, the large companies, once they get to a certain scale, they kind of play defense. So we're focused on protecting what they have. It really requires the entrepreneurs who are playing offense and kind of swinging for the fences to do great things. So entrepreneurship is important, not just in terms of creating new services that can improve people's lives or creating value that rewards shareholders or employees. It's also important in terms of the underlying economic future of our country. If the third century of America is going to be good as the second century, it's really going to require people like you to take those risks. Hopefully you'll be somebody in the audience creating the next Google that went from 10 years ago, probably 10 or 20 employees. Now, I think it's 20,000 or AOL, which we started about 30 employees, peak 10 years later, I think it was about 12,000 employees. That's great in terms of those companies and their particular success. But if you multiply those successes by 1,000 or 5,000, and the ripple effect and the economy, it's really quite extraordinary. So it's important both in the context of entrepreneurship as a business building opportunity, which I'm sure is attractive to some of you. But it's also critically important in terms of our nation's future, which is why it's great to be here. In terms of thinking about a talk like this, it's hard to know where to start. And I think it's always good to try to keep it simple. I'm sure some of you have heard of the kiss prints will keep it simple stupid. So I'm going to try to keep it really simple. I'm basically going to give you, essentially, one idea to remember. Now, I'll come back to it a few times in the talk. I'll try to leave a reasonable amount of time for your questions. And the idea is basically this. In terms of success in business, probably success to any organization, but particularly success, if you're focusing on being an entrepreneur, it requires the three peas. And the three peas are people, passion, and perseverance. And you have all of those together in the right balance. Almost anything is possible. If you don't, nothing is possible. So I think it's really important to focus on people, passion, and perseverance. And rather than going to go through a traditional lecture and talk about that, I thought I would do it in the context or through the prism of my own story and tell you how I got started and sort of the journey I've been on over the past 30 years or so. And perhaps that would be instructive. And I'm going to break it into three parts. The first part was the growth of AOL and how the internet came of age and some of the things I learned there. The second part was when AOL and time Warner merged, and that didn't work still well, so I'm going to try to keep that part of it short. And then the third part, which is sort of what I've been doing recently, a little bit of a, I guess, a rebirth or a surge is kind of going back into the garage and creating new companies and some of the, just still a work in progress and through this company, Tom mentioned revolution. And I'll talk a little bit about what we're doing and why we're so passionate and focused on the right people and trying to persevere. So as I said, my story really begins about 30 years ago. Actually, it was a senior at college at Williams on the East Coast. And I remember reading a book called The Third Wave by an author by the name of Alvin Tofford. And Alvin Tofford was viewed as sort of a science fiction guy, kind of a futurist kind of predicting the future. But I remember reading this book and being completely riveted by this notion what he called the electronic front here. So someday people would be connected to technology to different devices and be able to connect to people and information all around the world. And most people reading that book were thinking of it in a context of kind of futuristic science fiction. I remember reading that when I was a senior, as I said in college, and knowing it was going to happen and being certain it was kind of the next big thing. So I was completely captivated by this notion. And when I was a senior and studying to look for jobs and apply, the letter I accompanied my resume with talked about this. And I wrote this down because it's sort of interesting. I firmly believe the technological advances in communications will result in our television becoming an information line, newspaper, school, computer, computer referendum machine, and catalog. So that was 30 years ago. IBM PC hadn't yet even come onto the market. But there was something bubbling with this idea of something happening in this interactive world. By the time in 1980 when I was graduating, there weren't companies doing. So it was still more of an idea than a reality. So there was no companies to join to be on this journey. So I went the more the corporate route. And for a couple of years, work for Procter and Gamble and Cincinnati, great marketing company, learned a lot of things. Actually, at the same time, I was there. A lot of other people have gone on to great things. And technology, Steve Balmer from Microsoft, or Meg Whitman for eBay is now running for governor, or Scott Coku, the founder, into it. We're all kind of hanging around Cincinnati at Procter and Gamble trying to learn about consumer research and marketing and so forth. The death for a couple of years. And then moved to PepsiCo, a division called Pizza Hut, which I'm sure you're familiar with. The reason I did that was because it was highly entrepreneurial. It really was a company run by the franchisees. It was almost the opposite of Procter and Gamble, which is more of a kind of top-down, very process oriented company where all the key decisions were made. And since then, it pizzaed really all the big decisions were made by franchisees and different markets. It did that for about a year. But all the while, I was still completely captivated by this idea of interactive services. So my day job was really what I was doing, kind of making a living and trying to learn some things. But I really, my mind was really much more focused on this idea of interactive services. I couldn't quite figure out how to break. And finally, in 1983, 27 years ago, I moved to Washington, DC to join a company that had a product called Game Line. And again, this is just when PCs were beginning to come on stream. Very few people had an Apple too or an IBM PC. But almost everybody had Atari video game machines. And so the idea of Game Line was you plug a modem, look like a cartridge, but actually it was a communications modem into your Atari game machine and essentially plugged it into the phone line and then could connect to the world. Initially, the download video games, almost an in-home arcade. You push a button and the game would be downloaded. But over time, it could move into interactive service email and stock quotes and so forth. So I finally found my opening, my big opportunity to get into this interactive services world and join that company in the summer of 1983. But this is where I learned about perseverance. Because what seemed like such a great idea then within months was a disaster at the brink of bankruptcy. Just as they were shipping the product, everybody gave it great reviews. Everybody was excited, but just as it was kind of coming to market, the Atari video game market really imploded. And suddenly the retailers came out and so forth. No longer wanted any new Atari video game products. A lot of loans, some wacky new concept like Game Line. That's basically canceled their orders and the ones that took them didn't really promote them and very few people bought them. I remember at one of the board meetings, one of the investors which actually accompanied based here that is highly regarded probably the best known and most respected venture capitalists in the Eric Clienter Perkins coffee buyer as one of the founders. Frank Coffield was on the board of this Game Line company and at that board meeting in the winter around 1983, looked at the sales statistics from the retail stores and said you would have thought they would have shoplifted more than that. That's how terrible the sales were. So this really was pretty dicey. My parents of course were a little uncomfortable about this new development. They kind of knew what I was doing at Procter and Gamble. Didn't quite kind of know what I was doing at PepsiCo seemed like real fortune 500 companies so that they could explain to their friends. Suddenly I went this entrepreneur right about to Game Line and within almost months the thing was on the brink of defeat. We stuck with it and thankfully two of the people I met there and I went off in 1985 and started what became AOL. We redirected it not surprisingly away from Atari video game machines and towards home computers which were beginning to catch on. We launched in the fall of 1985 our first service which was for Comma or 64 computers called Quantum Link or Q-Link and it was focused on how do you take that barely basic computer and try to make it into more of interactive services terminal. Then we launched a service with Tandy called PC Link and with IBM called Promethon. That was a big breakthrough because IBM was the first computer. This is back in 1988 or 1989. They actually built a modem into a PC up until then the PC manufacturer didn't think anybody cared about the interactive services world. They're going to buy a computer for spreadsheets and work processors and store recipes. The idea that people wanted to talk to other people or access information seemed a little crazy. It's only something kind of weird hackers might be interested in. Finally IBM agreed that maybe they should give it a shot and built the modem in and that was really important. Then we launched a service in partnership with Apple called Apple Link Personal Edition. That whole period from 1985 to 1990 was really about creating private label services in partnership with PC manufacturers which was important for us and we had no money. We had a few million dollars of venture capital. We were competing at the time with a company called Prodigy that was backed by IBM and Sears and they backed it with one billion dollars. We knew we couldn't compete head to head. We had to come up with some other strategy in partnering with companies and developing these private label services was a key strategy for this. We looked back now 25 years ago with a launch of QLINK and some of the other services. There really were a number of breakthroughs that really in retrospect were quite significant. The first online service to use a graphical interface to take advantage of the power of computers to make an interesting service. All the other services like CompuServe were text oriented services. It was the first offer that software for free using a razor and blades analogy. Actually something I learned at Procter & Gamble. You sort of give away the razor to make money on the blades. Everybody else was selling software. We chose to give the software away and give people a free month with the idea that they liked it and they would become paying customers. We also were the first company to launch a graphical multiplayer game. People take for granted now in 1986. We partnered with George Lucas in Lucasfilm to create something called Habitat. We also were the first company to really, really focus on community. IBM and Sears were focusing on computing and selling stuff and other companies like Night Ritter, a newspaper company was focused on ViewTron, which is sort of an electronic newspaper. We said the real killer app in this medium and really the sole is medium was going to be community. People interacting with each other. We launched chat rooms and message boards and in the fall of 1985, we launched the first instant messaging. I am, which obviously has become a mainstream application, including now with texting on phones. The company was really quite innovative in that time frame. I know you're sitting there. There's a lot of you that weren't even born at the time I'm talking about trying to relate to this. A lot of people I work with whip together video over the weekend to try to give you a little bit more context and whoever was going to start that video. You could hear that up. Let me give you before we push the button a little bit of context on it. Basically, it's trying to make a little bit kind of back to the future funny, but there's two different interviews with little demos in this short and I could share a four minute video. The first was filmed in 1987 and it's me and my first ever television interview talking about Q-Link. I was nervous as you could be. I don't think I slept that night. It was for a show called Computer Chronicles. It actually was filmed not far from here in San Mateo. I really thought of the big leagues. Of course, Computer Chronicles was only aired on a few PBS stations, but I really thought I had kind of arrived. I'm trying to explain the service, but more importantly, watch the screen because of you. What was then viewed as pioneering in terms of a graphical interface to make it easy to use is somewhat laughable looking back 25 years later. Then the second interview was seven or eight years later. It was 1995. PBS, their news hour, did a longer 10 minute piece on AOL. This is really when the internet was coming of age and AOL was on fire. That kind of gives you more of a sense of what we were doing with AOL in the mid-90s. Again, in retrospect, 15 years ago, some of the things that were then kind of break through pioneering what the little quaint, but hopefully, you will enjoy this. Let's roll and take. We're sending you back to the future. Joining us now in the studio is Steve Case, Vice President of Marketing for Quantum Link. We just launched Quantum Link a year ago in November, and when we entered the market, we saw three problems for consumer users of online services. The first is they're too expensive. The second was they're just too difficult to use, and the third is they just weren't fun. What we're looking at right now is the Quantum Link main menu. As you see, there's eight different departments on the service. To move around, all you do is use this cursor key and it will flash around to the different departments. People connection is what we call a social center of the system. That's where people meet in rooms like a lobby, which you see here. We can type a message like, hi, it comes down at the bottom and simply press return. It will be broadcast everybody in that room. Do you know what this means? From the moment you log on, America Online is deliberately designed to be inviting, non-technical, and easy to use. More like a visit to the local shopping mall, than a trip through cyber space. This video console will be channeled into the store of her choice. There, a camera will scan a display of wires, which she will select by push button. What do you view a definition of cyber space? I really like the cyber space. It sounds kind of science fiction-y. I think of this more of interactive services being in new mediums. This telephone was a medium or television was a medium. The people around the country would be able to plug into these services and access information to make people and buy products and learn new things. And this new interactive world, people can interact with the content, interact with the services and really customize the services to meet their own needs. When you look down the line into the future, I don't know how far away it is. In your wildest and formed imaginings, what do you think? I don't see any reason to believe that over the long run, it won't be as important as the telephone was. Nobody really conceived of the idea that one day everybody would have phones. In fact, many people have multiple phones. It would change the way they communicate with people and buy products and conduct the everyday life. I think this interactive medium is on that same cap. And just as with the telephone, pick several decades. It will take several decades here to have that ubiquity. But my sense is it's going to happen. It's going to be quite exciting to watch. I noticed that second interview, somebody must have told me tox lowly. I feel like I'm drugged there watching it right now. Tox lowly, make sure you in non-CAA. Is he a sleeper or is he awake? I talked to you earlier about the private label service strategy. I want to talk a little bit more about what we do with AppleLink. This is also ties in with one of those P's, which is perseverance. We actually, in 1987, entered into an agreement with Apple to license their brand name to create AppleLink. It never licensed their brand name before. It was a big breakthrough that we were able to convince them to do this, particularly because we're a company there with probably 75 employees at best. We're all excited. We thought this was just terrific. AppleLink, we made it. We launched the service next year in 1988. We pulled the plug on the service next year in 1989. The reason is, although we thought of time a great coup that we were able to do this deal with Apple and get their brand name, almost from the day we signed the deal, they hated it. Because they really got uncomfortable about the fact that some of the company had their brand name and they were uncomfortable about the way we were marketing the product. They were selling software through retail stores. We were giving software away. There are a lot of different things that were just kind of loggerheads. Actually, after just less than a year after we launched the service, they basically said we're just too uncomfortable. They paid us millions of dollars basically to go away. They just decided they didn't want to be in this anymore. So then we had our little crisis on our hand. It's not bad that we got some money out of it, but that had been our strategy. Partner with these private label services in conjunction with PC manufacturers. Apple was emerging as a real force and suddenly that deal blew up in our face. So that was a real crisis for the company and it led to a new strategy. We could no longer rely on these partnerships. We really need to stand our own two feet and kind of have our own brand. We had no idea what to call it. We had a little contest internally and American online became the name that he emerged from that. We mostly picked it because since we had no money to market it, at least explain what we did. Some of the other services at the time, like Prodigy and Contra, they're not quite sure what it was. American online was pretty clear what we were up to. It was pretty helpful in terms of our relatively limited marketing budget. So we relaunched the service in 1989, 1990, essentially as American online. And as you know, quickly it kind of got nicknamed by, I really remember, as AOLs, so it evolved to be more and more AOL. That's really when AOL started coming of age. Partly because we had our own brand and standing our own two feet. But also some things were starting to break in our favor instead of, as we saw from most of the 80s, kind of flag the tape. People didn't really believe in what we were doing. They didn't even understand what we were doing. I'd go to technology conferences like PC Forum and there'd be 500 people there. I'd be the only person who was focused on online service. Everybody else was talking about semiconductors and different devices and ethernet and so forth. And I was kind of a little wacko in the corner talking about online services someday. People do this, some day people do that, and most people really didn't believe. But as the 90s broke, people things started breaking in our favor. A big breakthrough was in 1992. And again, I know it seems silly to many youth at this point. But up until 1992, it was illegal to connect the commercial service like AOL to the internet. The internet had been funded by the government and up until 1992 was really for non-commercial users. You could use it in educational institutions, government contractors could use it, government self could use it. But you couldn't actually do businesses on it. And Congress passed a law in 1992 that basically allowed companies like ours to connect to the internet. That was a big force not long after the worldwide web was created. The web browser was developed and that's when really things started taking off. So it was really 1992 when there was a breakthrough. We started the company in 1985 and 1992. We actually went public and we were the first internet company to go public. But even then people didn't quite understand what we did. And in fairness, after seven years, we had, I think it was 184,000 customers. We had something like 70 employees. And the market value of the company on the first day of the public offering was $70 million. So it was just another little company going public. Nobody, particularly newer cared what this company was up to. Needless to say, the rest of the 90s things really got on fire. And by 2000, we had a market cap that gone from $70 million to over $100 billion. We'd gone from 185,000 customers to think it was peak about 20 million customers. And gone from less than a couple hundred employees to over 10,000 employees all in kind of a eight year period. We liked that period. That was a good period. And then the question is what do we do next? That we had done, I think, a great job. And creating a service that really struck a chord with a mainstream audience. We really created an easy to use, useful, fun, affordable service. And as people started learning about the internet and they wanted to get connected, the majority of Americans started their internet experience with AOL. As a result, we created what was sort of the dominant company. And at the time was the hottest industry arguably in the world. And also created a very valuable company. Actually, if you look at the stock market in the 1990s, AOL was the number one stock in terms of performance. Bigger than Microsoft or Cisco in terms of if you bought it to the IPO and kept it that whole period, or your return, everything was going great. But we had a few problems. And that's why as we entered the next decade, we were really focused on where we were going to go from here. The first was it was great that we suddenly had this $100 billion valuation. But we knew it was not trivial to sustain it. I can't remember exactly what our multiple of revenue and earnings was, but it was at least a hundred. It was hard to see how you would sustain that. So looking to use that currency to acquire other assets and diversify the next became important. The second is we had really dominated in the first wave of the internet, which is a narrow ban, connecting people through telephone lines and through their computers of these devices. But we didn't have a clear path to broadband or wireless, which we knew was the next big thing. And so the question is how do we partner or merge with a company that had a broadband capability. And frankly, from a personal standpoint, I was getting a little worn out. I'd been running pretty fast for the better part of a decade. It's kind of like being on a bucking bronco in the speed kept getting accelerating. I really enjoyed the early stage for the first decade when it was kind of pioneering and you're making things up as you go. The second decade when it really was scaling and it was just more about frankly being an icon and going, making speeches and traveling around the world, some part of that was fun, but it actually wasn't as fun for me as the first part of the decade. And frankly also, I had a young family and I recognized it was probably time to focus a little bit more on that. So from a personal standpoint, I was trying to figure out what the next phase would be for me. For a variety of reasons and there are others as well, exactly 10 years ago, 10 years ago last month, AL merge with time more. And we thought this was the perfect deal because essentially would ensure ALs transition to broadband. Because time Warner was the largest owner of cable systems that had a broadband capacity. And also the largest owner of multimedia content, CNN and time magazines and so forth that we thought it would be valuable in a broadband world. We also thought that time Warner's weakness could be addressed by AL because they had very strong positions in traditional media, but didn't have their own path to a digital future. And the combination and the synergies that could come from bringing these companies together really would be great and kind of drive. Accelerated growth and revenues and profits and everything would be terrific. And we announced the merger. Everybody agreed indeed some of our competitors, Microsoft and Disney others basically marched on Washington to try to block the merger because they thought this company would just be too dominant and somehow would control the future. But it took a year to get it approved because all the different different lobbying forces that were out there at the time. But finally we were able to bring this together and launch it. As part of that and bringing it together, I did agree to step down as CEO and become kind of chairman of the board, which was frankly an important way to get the deal done. But also satisfied my own desire to play less of a day-to-day role and be playing much more of a strategic role. So what happens? There's two companies, two great companies with great histories coming together, the turn of the century to create this new company that would really drive convergence and help reinvent digital music and a whole wave of services. Yet, ten years later, people look back at what was the largest merger and still is the largest merger in history. At the end of the day when we announced the merger, the market value of a combined company was $350 billion. And the announcement was such a big deal as a lead in all the network news. I remember the weekend after we announced it, I was walking through Dallas Airport and looking at the news stand. And it's essentially every cover of any time and newsweek and businessweek and fortune were all focused on this merger. Everybody thought this was the next big thing and almost guaranteed to work indeed. That's why there's so much lobbying to oppose it. Now let's look back as the worst merger in history. It is. So what happened? It's eye dissected. There's a few things that I think are important lessons to learn as you think about your entrepreneurial futures. The first, and this was only a factor, but it's worth mentioning, there was a perfect storm of things that really run fortunate, a lot outside of our control. Almost immediately after the merger closed, the economy went into recession. Almost immediately, therefore the advertising revenue with a core revenue stream of the company was kind of in free fall. And the internet boom that had been driving market value in the later part of the decade really became the internet bus. So I mean, we call that sort of the internet's nuclear winter. So a variety of kind of broader systemic things were happening. But that really only accounts for part of it. I think that did translate to some things that led to some anger and resentment. Since we actually ended up in retrospect doing this deal at the peak of the internet values, as I recall, AOL at the time of the merger was twice as valuable as time Warner, even though time Warner had four times more revenue and earnings. So it was a little bit of a mismatch. And when things slowed down, people on the time Warner's side were, none do have me about that. So that would have created a factor. But the core of it goes back to these three people, passion and perseverance. On the people's side, what seemed like a good idea quickly became a culture clash. People were focused on the wrong things, not really focused on innovation, more focused on their own issues. On the passion side, frankly, a lot of it drove AOL and the 90s was lost. Some of the most creative pioneering innovative people kind of wandered off and became more corporate. And on the perseverance side, that probably because things had corrected the internet sector, there was a sense that maybe this internet really was just a fleeting phenomenon. It wasn't really a sustainable phenomenon. So instead of continuing to invest in innovating, there was tendency back wave. Remember one of the last deals I did before I stepped down was we invested in Google. We bought 5% in Google for, you know, essentially next to nothing. But that stake was sold immediately when Google went public. If they had held the stake, that 5% in Google would be worth more today than AOL is today. But their sense was just going to, you know, just monetize this and move on. So as disappointing at a variety of levels, I didn't have any day-to-day role as chairman of the company of sort of the visible target, frankly. I decided about eight years ago, to step down as chairman, about it would be good for the company to have a fresh start and be able to kind of look at, you know, focus more on the future than the past. And also frankly for me, it was recognizing that having a role where you have, you're kind of held responsible, but don't really have the day-to-day authority to make things happen. It's kind of not a great place to find yourself. So anyway, left. And it was a disappointment because we had such a great run up until then and the merger was launched with such fanfare and promise. As I think back on it, it's not just the three P's to keep in mind, it's also what Thomas Edison said, which I think summarizes this merger and five words, which is vision without execution is hallucination. We had a really good idea, but we didn't focus with the right people, the right passion, the right perseverance on executing that vision. So the question for me was, what are we next? And I was, I don't know, young 42, 43 at the time. So it wasn't quite, you know, wasn't quite ready to kind of give it up and golf or something like that because I'm not in good at golf. So I was trying to figure out what I do next. And as I reflected on that run over 20 years, as I said earlier, I realized I really liked that first decade, the pioneering decade more. And so I decided to launch a new company revolution in our focus. Our mission is to invest in people and ideas that can change the world. And interestingly, that's exactly the same mission we have at the case foundation, which we launched my wife, Gene runs, invest in people and ideas that can change the world. Sometimes you can change the world by investing in the prism of for profit businesses. And sometimes you can change the world by investing through the prism of not for profit philanthropic organizations, but the core idea is the same. On the revolution side, we focused in the last five, six years on a variety of different industries that we think are right for disruption. We really want to take risk and swing for the fences and try new things. We recognize we'll fail some time, but we'd rather take those risks. And frankly, right now there is too much, too many entrepreneurs, too much venture capital that isn't taking a big risk. They're taking kind of a little risk. And it's more of a built to flip mentality as opposed to a built to last change the world mentality, which troubles me a little bit. It's actually become particularly an internet space, a little bit like the entertainment business. It's relatively easy to produce a record. It's actually relatively easy now to produce a movie. But it's relatively hard to build a big audience in a significant franchise. The beariest entry have come down. Now anybody can create a website. But as a result, there's significant competition. And a real battle is not just about the product. It's really a battle for attention and being able to sustain that. And as a result, there are relatively small amounts of money go into these companies, which is fine, but they generally don't have the ability to take significant risks. Our strategy is a little different. We're willing to take significant risks. Indeed, we want to find the opportunities that are going to take five or ten years to really come to reach the end of the world. We're going to come to reach fruition. Next example is we're focusing the transportation sector back to company called ZIPCAR, which is on the Stanford campus. And somebody that you may be familiar with it. It's a very basic idea. If you live in a city, you shouldn't own a car. But occasionally you need access to a car. So we'll park those cars in a neighborhood and you'll use them whenever you want. It's more environmentally friendly. It's more economically sound for people. Most cities will spend $1,000 a month to have the car. You look at the insurance and the parking and so forth and use it four or five times. So it's crazy on a car. ZIPCAR is a much better way to go. And their company has really taken off. It has over 100 million in revenue now. I think hundreds of thousands of people are sharing probably about six, seven thousand cars right now. And it's really the early days in terms of that car sharing business. I wouldn't be surprised if the whole automobile that business didn't migrate from a product business to more of a service business. It's more like cell phones. Right now you buy a car and then you pay for gas. I could imagine models like ZIPCAR will become much more significant when Detroit tries to reinvent itself. Maybe it's more like you get access to the car at a lower price and there's sort of an ongoing monthly service fee. But even better yet you only use it when you need it like ZIPCAR. So that's one example. We've also invested in a number of healthcare companies. We think healthcare is broke in this country. We think the government can do part of it. But the private sector needs to do it as part as well. And ultimately we think it's about empowering consumers to understand their health and be able to make healthier choices by educating them and giving them tools and also using technologies and supporting tools. And several companies there, the most visible ones company called Everyday Health, which is now one of the leaders that won't talk too much about them because actually a couple of weeks go file for public offerings who are in the quiet period right now. So I don't want to get them in trouble. Also back to company and the resort business called Exclusive Resort. The idea that it's kind of crazy. And home that you only use a few weeks a year. Wanting to join a club that gives you access to hundreds of homes and dozens of destinations. We also funded a company called Revolution Money that was building a financial services company. And this actually a great lesson in perseverance. When it was initially launched about four years ago, everybody was very excited by the idea of creating new kind of credit card digital payments and sort of like what PayPal is doing around this flexible platform for online and offline and debit and credit and so forth. And you know, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley and all these companies were investing in it. And suddenly about two years ago, the financial services market started imploding and all these companies pulled back. And the company was really in serious trades. But they stuck with it and the investors stuck with it. And just last month, American Express bought that company for $300 million. I think it's a good example of what seemed very bleak just a couple years ago. They were able by sticking sticking to it to build a significant company that equal power American much American Express's strategy for the coming decade. So that's sort of my story. The early days may well and trying to, you know, with this crazy little motion 30 years ago after reading the third wave about the interactive services electronic frontier. Playing a role in building that and making that a mainstream kind of everyday phenomenon, you know, followed by the second phase and the merger and trying to deal with some of the fallout from that. And the third phase really getting back into being an entrepreneur and doing pioneering things and partnership with lots of different entrepreneurs. So in closing before I open for a question is what you know, and I started, which is the notion that an entrepreneurship really is critical to this country. It's not something just to do to make a buck or to create innovative service, although both of those are fine indeed important. It really is the underlying engine of innovation that will ensure a bright future for this country. And actually is a patriotic thing to do not just economically, you know, motivated thing to do and it's very important to understand. The second is I actually think we're ending into what may be a golden era for entrepreneurship. For the reason I mentioned a lot of the big industries and the big companies are playing defense. They're more focused on protection and defense, not attacking an opportunity. And that's going to create enormous opportunities across I think our entire economy for bold entrepreneurs swinging for the fences. And finally, just want to remind you about those three Ps because for me I found them to be very important. I try to reassess from time to time during what we're focusing on or what the companies we're invested in are focusing on. Do you have the right people that are aligned around the right priorities? Is there an underlying passion not just from the founder CEO, but it's really spread through the old company. And when times get tough and inevitably they do, they have the fortitude to see it through that perseverance factor. So those three Ps for me have been very important. Let me end there and start taking your questions. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So, I'm going to be up steeply. I teach several entrepreneurship classes for top buyers and Tina Sealig in the SBB program. I also teach a class called the Spirit of Entrepreneurship, which Tom mentioned, which surrounds this class of foveza or role. Do you know what we do? Is we listen to the ETL speakers, we analyze their business models with their companies and try to understand how their company's got from one or two people in a room to a large major corporation. And the Spirit of Entrepreneurship class gets typically the first couple of questions. Given the size of the audience today I'll just hold it to one and then we'll open it up to others. And so Steve just kind of segue against the entrepreneurial spirit. You started your career as a product manager, some of the best training that one could ever get in large corporations. Can you remember your first couple of weeks or month in your startup, 1983? I think what is it I couldn't wear in a proctored gamble or pizza Hut because none of this works like that. What was the kind of entrepreneurial disconnect you had? Well, I should give you a little more context. The simple answer is company like Proctored gamble have developed over a century really good processes for managing. But they tend to be focused on incrementalism. So any idea you want to do it takes some time to test. I remember one of working a beauty here, side of the business, care condition or things like that. And we were going to test having on a package instead of it's called the price bags have 20 cents off was going to be 25 cents off and instead of like orange is going to be yellow. Ultimately basic things. At the time they've changes to do that would take two years to do a test mark to see which color was better whether 25 cents really lifted sales versus 20 cents. So it really is focused on really fine tuning things and they've been very effective. It was still the largest most successful consumer. Package goods company in the world, but it wasn't as you say kind of really honed on entrepreneurship. Thankfully when I was growing up and in the teenager I was involved in a lot of different businesses and starting different things. None of them were successful of any any real scale, but I had that experience of kind of starting things and trying and taking risks there. So for me the decision to go to a proctrine gamble was a decision even though I had this leaning towards entrepreneurship and this passion towards interactive services that I knew it would be a smart thing to do and I'd learn a lot by doing it. So it's almost for me like going to a business school or something. I should say I come out of willing but I did apply to Stanford Business School. I got rejected so therefore I had to go start a business. And that's where you're going to be a donor to the engineering store. Yeah, well we'll see we'll see. So we'll we'll do that for the audience. Questions. Yes. On their mics. The mics around my phone. Yeah, there's some mics in the windows. If you stand up and just let you get it on tape. So for anybody has questions, why don't you guys line up at the mics? I'm wondering if the consumer products and services have important for you to say blockers and other factors in the ecosystem? Well, I think I think a lot plays a factor but one of the truisms is if you're working really hard and showing up a lot, you know those people tend to be luckier. There is something for being at the right place the right time but there's also something for you know kind of peeking around corners and trying to understand where the position yourself so you're in the right place. And so it's a mix of factors. Anybody who's been successful with credit, some degree of walk to it at the same time to suggest that well it's all about walks. So I guess it doesn't really matter what I do. I'll strike gold or not. I won't obviously isn't is a is a tree there. So it's a mix of factors. But a lot of it is just being aware, paying attention and kind of scanning the universe, sort of looking for, like pattern recognition, looking for opportunity and getting a sense of where you should be going. And at some point a sense that now is a time to really slam down the accelerator. Yes on this side. I was a retail stocker in the late 90s. I just kind of first of all say, I'm a hauler. I mean a lot more than anything else stock. Thank you. Just secondly, right now in online education, is actually a great equalizer for people in the community, gain access to higher education. And how long do you think helped take to gain traction? Lastly, I know you're a clinical school with Barack Obama at the same time. Can you see it actually as you went out the link with the way he says it was? Okay, well let me think the last question first. I did go to pun on schools in Hawaii. I was in high school together. I was a senior when the president was a freshman. It was a pretty big school. So I can't say we're like best buddies. I kind of vaguely recall playing basketball with them a few times. I don't think we ever had any classes together. And so I can't really comment on his story. I do know when you started running for president. Somebody figured out that we'd gone to high school together. So I was getting all these calls in New York time. They were like, tell me some story about Barack Obama. I was tempted to make something good up. I finally decided that maybe that benefit of I came up with a real doozy. But I decided to be honest and say, well I actually don't really remember him. But I think he's obviously had a great campaign. And he's had a tough first year as a most president's do, particularly in a difficult environment like this. But I think the perspective he actually brings apart from being in Hawaii. As you know, growing up there, it's sort of a melting pot. And I think there's more of a sense of how do you bring people together than perhaps some other areas of the country? So hopefully that both. Well, in terms of education, I do believe technology can be important equalizer. Indeed, one of the initiatives our foundation did about a decade ago was to create a technology center in over a thousand communities. And boys and girls, clubs and schools and churches called power up. Because we really wanted to make sure we bridged the digital divide. And we didn't have these technology tools only available. People could afford them and actually potentially exacerbate that divide. And there's still some divide today, but it was less than it was. And the ability for people anywhere around the world to access information, of course, is like this one and have almost a ubiquitous access to information. Obviously, it's important. The same time you can't underestimate the importance of learning the basic skills, particularly in terms of how to digest, absorb, analyze and communicate information, which is going to continue to be the bedrock of education. And I think it's going to continue to be done in a physical space. So making sure our elementary schools and high schools and so forth really are in better shape in the future than they are today is an important part of that. So technology and add on, I do think it leads to much more of a sense of lifelong learning. It's not so much what you learn when you're in school. It's really learning some basics, learning how to think and communicate. But then having access to information really for the rest of your life. So it is a tremendous tool, but we can't simply point to technology and think that somehow we've solved the problems of education, which obviously are much more complicated and challenging. Yes? What do you see the biggest problems in the opportunities around structure and healthcare education and also power? And also the other way is monetization on the other side of the class. There's problems, but there's also big option for call sales. If you can give them most of the billings. Yeah, and the answer to the question is on all three, it's sort of the same, which is our country and many other countries have built infrastructure of the past century. Basically, power some of these different industries, whether it be the physical structures in terms of schools and how schools are organized, how long you go to school, and teachers are organized and so forth, which is hard to change. Healthcare, particularly in this country, is basically focused around who pays. It's less about the provision of service. It's more about who pays. Unfortunately, it's not really a healthcare system. It's really a sick care system. It's not so much focus on keeping it healthy. It's more triage when you get sick. And the motivation and incentives are more about dealing with sick care. And we need to change that psychology and that culture. So people really are generally focused on health, not just focused on dealing with illness. And power as similar as well. It's huge infrastructure has been built. There's been great and served as well for the past century, but new technologies are emerging. And there are obviously many companies around the world that are doing really interesting things that really can start from scratch. And I think most people recognize that they had the opportunity to start from scratch, whether it be communication systems or power systems or what have you, they would take a different path. And then we took 50 years ago or 100 years ago. Obviously, a lot has changed. Indeed, if you look at what's happening in developing countries, they're placing fundamentally different bets. And in the case of communications, for example, nobody's bothering to dig up the streets to run wires, whether it be for a telephone or cable, they're completely embracing wireless. So the challenge is how do you bridge what we've built and invested gazillion dollars in over the past century to be more nimble and flexible for the future? Yes. Steve, you know, I have a two-part question. The first you mentioned luck, and I think luck is when preparation meets opportunities. And, you know, having said that, there's also a lot in it that's timing. And you were very fortunate as you described years and how the internet, the advent of the internet, and your timing was spot on. There's a lot of entrepreneurs that somehow have wonderful ideas, have wonderful passion, have great people, but the timing is just the wrong time and the company doesn't work. And so the second part of the question is, and obviously, the first part is that you spoke of some companies that didn't work at revolution partners, and the ones that didn't work when you first started in entrepreneurship. What I've always found interesting is when a company does well, you know why it does well, and maybe it's the people and the passion and the other things. But when it's, when it's, I'm sorry, you necessarily don't know why it does extremely well. It just does well. What I have always found is that you learn the most from something that faiths. And what I'd love to hear is some of the adventures that you've done, that you've attempted, that didn't work, whether in your own personal life before AOL, and then with revolution partners. Well, a bunch of things there. I would say this notion of walk and sort of having opportunity aligned, obviously that as I said before plays a role. At the same time, perseverance really does matter, as I was trying to explain, in the mid 90s AOL suddenly a big deal. It almost seemed like an overnight sensation came out of nowhere, was kind of one of the hottest companies in the country. But we were a 10 year in the making overnight sensation. We really had started more than a decade before people even knew what we were doing. And there are a lot of periods in that, you know, doing that development that we hit tough times, went through layoffs and lost some partnerships like Apple and so forth. So it wasn't like we just woke up one day, hung up a shingle and the world beat a path to our door. There are lots of ups and downs. And there were a number of people who were there in the early days who basically bagged it. They said, there's no risk to you. I don't believe in this thing anymore. But thankfully, there are enough that stuck with it that really believed in the idea and were passionate about the idea and eventually things developed. So I think one of the lessons is going back to the person's variant. If you really believe in the idea, figure out a way to stay on the game. Now that may mean, you know, cutting your costs, having to go through some difficult things, just to make sure you can survive and live to fight another day. But don't give up if you really believe in the idea. Because eventually, if you're right on the core assumptions, that eventually the market will open up and you'll have that opportunity. And it takes you off and people kind of give up too early. They hit a bump in the road or maybe a brick wall. The great entrepreneurs just figure out a way to get around the wall, get over the wall and knock the wall down. They don't let anything get in their way. What about failure? The biggest failure, obviously, when I was talking about was AOL Time Warner merger, which is a great idea that was terribly executed and that was a great disappointment. I have others too, but that's the big doozy. Hi, so I'm very, your company is exclusive for Zora Time Warner if there's more similarities or differences between running that and running AOL. Well, there's a number of different differences. First of all, I don't run exclusive resort state a day. I spend 10% of my time on it because I'm involved in a variety of different companies. I was running 110% of the time. The second is exclusive resorts is more about acquiring real estate and packaging. I said a service is around that real estate. Much more of a personalized service and frankly more of a luxury market because of the nature of the market we're targeting. AOL was about the mainstream. Really had to connect with the mainstream audience. We're trying to drive prices down and really make it as simple as possible for people to use. These services, I remember on the early, calling, you know, cries in the late 80s, early 90s, we need to make this simple enough for my mom to use. My mom was a little offended by this, you know, this analogy. But it was trying to communicate to our team that this is the world of technology is complicated and scary and threatening to most people. We need to figure out a way to simplify and package this so real people could use it. And the final one is that once you were able to break through on AOL, it really was about adding additional capacity, adding additional servers so you could scale relatively quickly. A physical business like an exclusive resource or a zip car, other things, require a little bit more of a pacing in terms of the growth. You can't just push a button and suddenly add 10,000 more cars and 10,000 more parking spots overnight. It requires more planning. Well Steve, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
