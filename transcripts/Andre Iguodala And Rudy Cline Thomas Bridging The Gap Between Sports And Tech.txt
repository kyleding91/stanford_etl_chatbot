 Who you are defines how you build. This is the OddPattern thought-of-the-your-series brought to you by Stanford E-Corner. Today we're delighted to welcome Rudy Klein Thomas and Andre Igodala to ETL, one of three Rudy Klein Thomas is the founder and managing partner of Mastery Inc., which brings together world-class athletes, technology companies to create top-tier platform-building opportunities. Now Andre Igodala currently plays for the NBA's Miami Heat for all you big area folks out there. As you know, he's won three NBA championships with the Golden State Warriors and in 2015 he received the NBA Finals most valuable player award. So why are these two sharing the bill? Well, off the court, Andre has also been at the forefront of venture capital and technology. And Rudy's been the catalyst for a lot of that. They formed a really unique working relationship that has involved backing market leading companies like PagerDuty, Zoom, CloudFair, to name just a couple companies that have also been highlighted at this ETL series. And they both serve on the board of Juma Technologies, Africa's largest e-commerce retailer. Now Rudy also founded the annual players technology summit with Bloomberg as a presenting partner, bringing together leaders in the technology venture capital, sports communities to discuss tech investing, trends, partnerships, and the future of sports and tech initiatives. And Andre has been deeply involved in that effort as well. So this is going to be a very, very cool story. If our two cool dudes find alignment and create massive change together. Welcome Rudy and Andre. How are you guys doing today? Good, good. It's good to be here. Appreciate it guys. It's nice to meet everybody. Welcome, Andre, how are you? I'm good. I'm good. I'm enjoying this hot weather. I'm good to be here. I always appreciate my top-level gig conversation. Yeah. Good one, thank you. Well, we have so much ground to cover. So let's get started here, right? So I want to start with how you two connected in the first place. Together, you've made really investments in some really impressive companies. And Rudy, you're also the first person Andre thanks at the end of his memoir, The Six Man. So could you both just talk a little about how you met and how you figured out that you were so well aligned? How that partnership and relationship gets started? Yeah, I'll start the the the the genesis of our relationship. You know, it's funny is we never agree on how it came to part. So it would be interesting to see what he agrees with and what doesn't. We met we met in Philadelphia. I started my well-claiming firm in Philadelphia. And a buddy of mine who went to Providence, I went to Providence College. I was a couple years older than him. He got drafted by the Sixers. And one of his closest friends on the team was I'm Andre. He was a client of mine. And Andre and I we met casually first. I mean, again, just being around and being not too far in age would have you. So and also being associated with Herbert Hills, his name. He went to Providence College. And again, we just formed a friendship first. And I used to share a lot of things that I was learning at the time as a tribute to finance. And share with Andre and we always sparked a conversation. And he was a very curious guy. And again, I was learning a lot at the same time and we started learning together. And then we started working together. I'm not sure if that's the way Andre recollected it. But again, it's been a while now. Yeah, Andre, how did what's your side? Pretty accurate. Just told the story about four hours ago actually. Close friend of mine has visited in the exact same question. I was trying to get some background. Different folks he hasn't met, but he knows really well. Through our networking and just communicating. But same exact story. And to go a little further, Herbert Hills, I was giving him some feedback and some constructive criticism on how to maneuver, how to play a ball, how to maneuver off the board. And more than enough time, he would say, you sound like Brut. I'm sure he was telling Brutus the same thing. So it's just that those synergies connected us and it's just been the journey started there. Yeah. So let's get into it Andre. My guess is that from the second you landed your first big NBA contract. You were inundated and flooded with people pitching you investment opportunities from all over the place. But what drew you to early stage technology investing in particular? What was the catalyst and how did you get started there? Well, that's a good question. You know, you talk about being so many investments, you know, being from our way. And when you first get your contract, you know, 20 years old, you know, the investments I see now are a lot different than the investments I see being 20 years old. So, you know, there was everything from barbershops to record labels to, you know, just a lot of mom and pop things from small town, my second went from. But, you know, going much further and in the sector right now, really, really got, you know, kind of sparked the thought in terms of being a professional athlete in long story short. You hear a lot about the horror stories of God's mismanaging their finances and, you know, understanding where we come from and the lack of financial education that we have is really easy to understand why we struggle. And I was like, really, I'm curious and, you know, he started asking me different questions, you know, why do you get charged this by your private wealth manager or why you charge this percentage regardless of if, you know, they bring you back 7% or if they lose you 2% on the year. And you will, you annual meetings and what does everything mean in terms of their information you're getting as far as budgeting, as far as, you know, managing your wealth for the next 60, 70 years of your life, you know, what you trust look like, all these things. So, you know, we go further and further down the pipeline, we're talking about, you know, you know, how bonds work and how, you know, public equity works and stocks. And when they just work the interest of opening up a simple e-trade account says, hoping of a e-trade account, start investing on your own and I'll help you a little bit and then we'll, you know, depending on the returns, we'll figure out a way to see what I earn, I mean, Rudy in that scenario. And that was the beginning of the journey in terms of having some success in the tech sector and Rudy starting to see, it's a lot that goes behind a company becoming public and who will retracting and that's when the world private sector came to, for the first time ever, it came to my, you know, it just came to my brain and I said, well, what is that? And once you start pulling back those layers, you start getting more and more interested in, and you start really getting doing deep dives into space and it's just a fascinating thing that curious person's mind will love to continue to go further into it. Yeah, well, it's interesting. We just got this conversation started and the two of you have already hit on, you know, the number one gold standard principle for investing or entrepreneurship and I think in life is having a growth mindset and being intellectually curious. So that's just such a reoccurring theme across the board, but this question's for the both of you. I think there's, as you know, a lot of factors to consider when you think about an investment, right, market size, the founders to the business plans, the underlying technology and IP and competitive differentiation, but do you feel you're both pretty aligned on how you prioritize those different factors or do you often find yourselves debating how to vet these opportunities? What's that dynamic like? We've essentially pretty much learned it all together again, it's been, I don't know, 13 or 14 years now. And we became into the sector together and we've learned actually together. So, you know, the first thing we did, Andre didn't mention this book, you know, we aligned ourselves with Josh Coppeman when he was in Philadelphia at first around capital. So, you know, early I realized, you know, who were the players in the space and the preeminent venture capitalist and then you know, I essentially wrote to him, Andrew Budbent to my conferences and you know, aligned ourselves with them first and foremost. So that's how we learned the industry and again, you know, we can, we can talk about Jeff Jordan and Andreessen, we can talk about, you know, Bill Gurley, we can talk about Josh, those are the guys that really that we learned from super early, as to just how to how to do diligence on these companies, what to look for. And again, we learned this essentially together. So how to look at companies and how to do diligence is pretty much the same. Yeah, do you guys ever have a different point of view and how's that get adjudicated or is that fairly rare? No, no, we always, we always have a different point of view. He'll speak to it, but I mean, you know, we use for all the students out there, we can use specific examples and we don't mind doing it. But, you know, I didn't see Dapper Labs early, you know, what's so ever. I didn't, I wasn't a big fan of it, didn't fully understand it. And Andre was extremely adamant on seeing it and he was really, really excited about it. You know, so that was one more we had a real difference of opinion. I'm glad I'm glad he pushed the push the envelope there obviously. But again, that's one one prime example of a time that we didn't really, we didn't we weren't aligned as to just the opportunity. Yeah, are there any other insights that you guys feel that you are able to hone in because obviously early stage investing is really, really hard because there's not a lot of market traction. It is not a lot, there's just not a lot of data to really make, you know, definitive decision, but you know, overall, if you guys found in through your partnership and you've looked at so many great companies and made so many great decisions, any reoccurring themes? Yeah, I think for me, the reoccurring theme has just been, you know, go what you understand. I mean, it's so simple to sit back, you know, watch CNBC or read the journal Financial Times every single day. And you know, you know, there'll be mention of a hot sector, you know, and then you dive into it would have you. I think we knew very, very early of, you know, where our critical advantage was, you know, as to either who we were exposed to and or Andre's platform or just sports in general. And we really don't deepen to those specific vertical super early and understood where our keen advantage wasn't just, you know, doing diligence and understanding and company versus the broader market. So you just have to understand where you have the opportunity and you where you have a clear advantage. If not, you're just playing the game with everybody else. And that's, that's not an advantage, right? You know, so. And then also being specific to a possibly a focus or two, you know, you can't spread yourself to thin. It's very important to go deep versus why, you know, and I think and that's that's something that we learn from the guys that that taught us in this business of how to how to attack it. Yeah, I know very insightful. Yeah. And Andre, when, do you know early on when you made a founder or companies presenting to you, whether, you know, do you know kind of early on it's something you think is going to click and you're interested. The something happened early on, or is it, does it take a while to process all of the kind of initial meeting and do diligence that you've done? Yeah, I think for me it's just being a professional athlete has its advantages. You really have to be able to try to get a really good understanding of who you're working with. You know, so many trades happening, coaches in and out, being traded and just happens to adjust on the fly. And also using your network. So when I meet a founder, you know, it's just trying to get a good day hour and not all do I click right away with. But, you know, the more and more time you spend with them, I wish you're getting a better feel for them. I look for certain things, you know, what is this weakness, what is the strengths, like I try to figure it out right away because that's going to help build that relationship. And then at the same time, you know, going back to your last question, you know, what do we look for? It's, you know, I also would use my network, you know, as soon as the time with Comcast Ventures and the catalyst fund, we were doing some due diligence on a few companies. And, you know, with me being an early trying to figure out how I value within the company and know what I know, I use my network a few times to get some due diligence on the companies and do even deeper dive into some investment opportunities. And a little bit older, I had some great network, networking, it's a folks that I knew within that space, this was particularly a space of someone that I knew who was a CEO of a company that was public within the same space that really helped us on a financial planning side. And it actually won us the deal. And my partner in crime were working me at the time, like, you know, most people don't have the access that you do. And I didn't know that just thinking it was this, I was just thinking this is just, you know, just a regular phone call and she's like, no, this is something that you could, you know, have advantage over others within you got to continue to explore. Trying to build an actual relationship with the founders is something I look forward to is not simply a financial investment or a transaction is actually building that relationship and building on something that's really going to talk about later what we're doing with what we're doing with master and seeing yields that we're getting involved. Yeah, you're going to be with those founders for usually at least 10 years before you kind of see an exit. So a relationship is so critical. Hey, Rudy, just so we can make our audience understand what you do. Can you explain exactly what mastery is like is it? Sure, sure, sure, sure, so, yeah, so, so, so mastery started out well, when I got to the private world business in 2015, we started the players tech conference in 2016. And I focused solely on on venture. So I started investing in an SPB's I've created these SPB's and it wasn't just Andre and I, you know, we brought along other athletes and other LPs a lot of them were the top CEOs again that you guys have surfaced and have been on your your platform before. And then, you know, as time went along and obviously you got more exposure for our for our investment prowess family offices have come along to and we're we're in the midst of raising a fund currently right now as well, much larger fund. Very cool. Okay, you're both on the board at the June of technologies, which is where you both serve on that board and maybe less well known into you west and some of the companies that we talked about earlier on when I introduced you guys, but tell me why you guys are so excited about that company in particular. Well, first and foremost, we're both Africans. So we are we both have African descent, Andrea and Andrea me, sir, and so the continent is near and dear to our hearts. We were exposed to Jim, you know, through through Morgan Stanley a couple years back as, you know, obviously the fastest growing company in Africa. So again, we were quite keen on understanding what they were doing. And then we just like Andre said, we really built a special relationship with the CEO, you know, again, not just investors, but we booked a special relationship with them and and he saw added value and you know, having us become part of this board, not with just our exposure to tech, being Africans as well to an understanding the landscape there. And again, you know, just being able to learn and grow with the company. So it's been one of our best experiences that we've had this for the last three years on being able to travel our favorite trip actually that we've taken recently was when we went to Nigeria, like a year and a half ago. That was one of the last trips that we took. And we had a we had a blast over there, but again, it's it's growing quite well. And again, being being African as well to it means a lot to us. Yeah, that's fantastic. I used to serve on a nonprofit board with Dr. Richard Leakey and we had many of our board meetings in Kenya. And that was always a really, really special trip. So you guys have talked a lot about this network that you've built and put together. And that's obviously delivered a tremendous amount of competitive advantage. And I think it's contributed to a lot of your success. But one of the projects that you're working on together, something called the players technology summit. Can you guys tell us how that got started and how you're using that to your advantage and where you want to take that because that's pretty fascinating. Yeah, I think Rudy came up with a great idea as we were trying to bridge the gap between sports and tech. There are a lot of parallels. And as you see, the streaming wars and as you see, a lot of the content providers are going to stream it. When you're seeing a lot of competitiveness in sports rights, you know, you just look at the NFL deals that just happened and you see Amazon going into broadcast games. You see games in broadcast even on Twitter. So the the worlds were just are coming together right now. But I think we kind of saw that vision way back when we actually went to Netflix as often as we had to test it out. We hate things and get a good feel what he was thinking about. And we, you know, we asked him questions about sports. So our minds are always just working and we saw what our exposure was if we wanted to. The ultimate thing is to bring it back to our players and being unified as one. There's so much leverage there with everything that we do is at V10. We go all the way into bringing my minorities into the tech space as well. There's so much influence. You know, we're one of the large. We are the large consumers on the planet, you know, as African Americans. So we've I feel personally feel like, you know, our culture is exploited. But our culture isn't given us either the table in terms of ownership in terms of, you know, states in these companies. That's something that has been presidenting with us for a very long time, not just within the last year or two. So what we wanted to do was, you know, bring that get bridge that gap and be to bridge for a lot of these players who may not have the understanding yet, but given the knowledge to understand what we're doing. Come on to play. We call it a platform to play for myself. So what we did was we started with the players association with our union with just a number board up. We have different player programs where there'd be learning about being a coach or a GM or broadcasting school, really state symposium, so many different things. So we wanted to bring the tech side of the table and we did it the first year. We had some great success, a lot of players, a lot of great energy came from it. So what we did was we took it upon ourselves to take it outside for, you know, a lot of different reasons that held us back to what we were really trying to do being that, you know, the union was involved. So we were able to go full scale, branching out on ourselves and partner with someone like Bloomberg. And it's been growing every single year of wall to wall. We asked everyone all walks of the tech space from entrepreneurs to investors to fund managers, the athletes who have started leagues and companies on their own. So players have got a chance to see every side of the tech space and understand how we can play a part and continue to add value to the companies that we invest in, a board for, you know, whatever they want to learn about in this space. That's fantastic. How long have you guys been putting that event on since 2016? Fantastic. I bet it's been growing by leaps and bounds over the years. Yeah, exponentially again, and we weren't sure we were doing when we started, but that's that that's been the beauty of it. You know, the residue is just seeing exactly how we've been able to scale it and build it and the brand that's actually created for itself, you know, away from us. Yeah, fantastic. All right, Rudy, this question is for you. Since you're connecting so many athletes to opportunities in tech, I'm curious what you're noticing about the nature of professional sports careers. And specifically, do you think that professional sports careers are changing in any important way in terms of the opportunities players are pursuing both during and after their careers? What does that dynamic look like? Yeah, I think that the funnel has gotten a lot earlier, you know, those kids coming out of school. Now that they've gotten exposure to some types of business, whether they're reading it or what have you again, it's just different when Andre was playing indoor when I was in school as well too. So now it's almost like they're there as soon as they're drafted, they become businessmen or and or have a certain level of business document and they're eager to get educated on so many in so many different lanes. And they understand that word platform now, extremely early from from almost day one, whereas before my opinion, it's it was only understood by a small group of athletes. And then also to I think what Andre's represented as well too is, you know, it all depends on the athlete as to what your platform is. Again, you don't have to be a, you know, 10 time all star or what have you to have a platform everybody looked at, you know, the Michael Jordan's and LeBron James is of the world as the only athletes that they can have these platforms. And I think what Andre's constituted is, you know, whether it be putting in the work or understanding what your access point is, you know, you can build and create a platform. And then most importantly, I think what he was able to absorb that most athletes don't is, you know, being able to be a conduit for other athletes and bringing them into to your funnel and or on your platform and helping them as well too. Only increases your reach and and your and and value. So so that's that's I think what's was differentiated here and what's changed. Yeah, and you said something really, really important, which is providing access and broadening that platform and campaign out. That's what I think is just so substantial and so awesome with the work that you guys are doing. So I tip my cap to the two of you. Andre, and in terms of this conversation of what professional sports career looks like, let's dive into one chapter of your book in particular. And you really emphasize the story of a major league baseball player named Kurt Flubb and how his push for free agency opened up some fundamental opportunities that professional athletes have today. Can you talk about why the story is so important? Well, this story is very important to me. I was going to my first time being a what we call unrestricted free agent. Restricted free agent means, you know, the current team has the first rise refusal and it usually takes about. You can take up to eight years, seven, eight years if you're, you know, hiring a player is like a football player who keeps getting franchise tech over and over, you know, which are really often to line with you for a back. They never really get to create a market and the free agent market really opens up not just opportunities, but your first time able to get leverage. And if you're in the same system or if you're in the same system constantly do a true work environment, you're never able to really know what your value is. Your value is always going to get down on place. So what Kurt Flubb was able to do is say, hey, you know, I want to be able to have a say so in round on work, which is what free markets are. And you know, without free agency is pretty much closed market. So, you know, your pace going to be less, you know, when I hear from what I grow into the lead is numbers always like, you know, if you say numbers numbers numbers, numbers, numbers to have a truth with, you make the numbers lie. And you looking at salary caps with some hard salt cap and all those things that have been played basketball related income, you know, what's a, you know, it takes basketball related income and you upgrade the arena for concerts. But that's not necessarily income, because concerts don't go under the basketball side. So just different things like that. And learning the actual system as a young player and you know, people like Rudy, my age is holding me accountable and you know, learn into collective bargaining agreement, you know, learn how your, your contract works. And what Kirk Flubbs able to do was give athletes an incentive to learn the ins and outs of the business supports. And so when you're going into free agency, you know, you know, you know, you probably got a couple teams who you feel like fit in well with, you know, their salary caps situation, you know, how much money is open, which gives you the best opportunity to maximize your earning potential. Yeah, that's very cool. Let's send that thing. I'm perhaps one of the most important topics, which is leadership. And I imagine you both get to interact with a more varied set of leaders than a lot of people from coaches to lead executive media executive CEOs, venture capitalists and the whole list just goes on from there. Is there one particular trait or behavior that you most respected leaders you've been able to observe over your careers. And I'm thinking here with traits that our students might want to adopt when they're leading organizations themselves, but also traits that should look for in people who will be leading them, right. So overall, what what do you guys look for in leadership and what's really resonated with you? I'll go first. Andres giving me the opportunity to meet so many influential people and great leaders of, you know, of the world now. And I think that the common thread amongst I think this a term that's coined so many times it might be cliche, but it's empathy. Eric actually is is one that we re enjoy always speaking to him and walk away, which is how great of a person that he is and how much thought that he puts into other people. I don't think that you know with the motivation of of profits right and returns and just the greed of wanting to make more money generally speaking again, that's generally the lost right because we have the social pressures to make more money or to hit earnings. When you have an individual that cares about people and can take that approach as it attributes to big business and then takes the long term approach as it attributes to business is not worried about the short term gains is a super special trait again because the social pressures whether it be financial or just again socio economic pressures that we have today at that level. Again, it's really really special so those are those are the two traits I think that that some of this the special individuals that we've met essentially having that we've really made sure that we stay close and if you have to put some names on it, Doug McMillan's one from Walmart Eric you on is one Mark Binyoff is another. That those are those are the three individuals I think that that have those traits that we stay close to yeah I would agree those are fantastic fantastic leaders and do an awesome job how about you Andre. Yeah, I just had a random meeting with someone else really fascinated by African American and James Bell used to be a former CEO of going and it's first African American on the board of Apple and I was I was not rushing but I had to get back to get to this but he was right around the corner and through a close friend they were meeting and I said I'll stop five for a second he was supposed to be a 10 minutes into being 30 minutes each gave me so much give me a welcome now. And we talked about empathy and compassion and you have people who want to see the next generation succeed so it's not just about the profits like really was just you know he said it perfectly you know they are short term girls but they're also long term goals that are associated with everything that you do and he gave me just a wealth of knowledge in terms of you know how to interact with you know within the board seat. You know how to get back and also I think about Steve Kerr Steve Kerr had a great line for me we had the best environment you can imagine in terms of it was just the innovation lab so we left it open for us to just use our imagination during practice and that's pretty structured environment but he just left it open for us to just go out there and just let loose and I just talked to him when he said to me you know I want you guys to come in and enjoy work. And I think that you deal with so much off the court being public figures and being well known and you know kind of the circus that we go through with that run we had I want you to come in here and forget about it I want you to just enjoy working hard and that's something as resident resonated with me going forward is built in environment where people really enjoy working but working hard at the same time and he says something to me that was profound he said you know I rather I rather have an enjoyable working environment everyone's having fun working with me. And we really are and we lose in the first round as opposed to being miserable and when the championship and you have to really think about what he said you know because there are other people that think the exact opposite you know if you're not winning then you should be miserable you know but you know at the end of the day you know we should we should you know these companies are built to you know connect each other and you know there's so many clinch days that go with our with the founders and what they're trying to build and you got some folks who are just trying to build a profit and a good job. I know that other people who would try to you know make communities together trying to make you know earth a better place. It's funny I just finished reading brief answers and brief questions by Stephen Hawking and that was you know his purpose of life was you know make a way for earth to be a much better place and explore other places just in case we mess it up one way. Now that's such an interesting read you really are incredibly well rounded person and you get your you know your sleaze up in a lot of areas on you that's awesome I think you know you guys touched on a really important point which you know traditional capital markets I think I just obviously focused on growth rates discounted cash flow multiple off of that. EPS and I think you're right like the great you know what a modern 21st century company looks like you can walk into gum you can be more than you know one dimensional you can take care of your employees and your customers and deal with some of the social issues that we have an environmental issues you can dominate your market you can deliver you know great financial results as well. I think that you guys are really seeing that and embody that and I just applaud that that point of view and that perspective on leadership so fantastic all right a whole bunch of questions Q and up and our Q and A here so let me turn it over to the students and let me tackle the most up voted question and this really goes to both of you but question starts out like this Andre mentioned that many communities lack financial literacy. Have you seen any opportunities to invest in new solutions to increasing and improving financial literacy? I think I just read something in terms of what Biden is trying to do with our education system I think it starts with the funding and education system and Rudy and I see each other a lot of different articles in content on whether be finances historically throughout the country so just rather peace. From Bloomberg in terms of why such a financial wealth gap and is getting is widening is not the graph is enclosing but is widening and it goes all the way back to you know segregation actually helped African Americans because we were able to build within our communities and when they desegregated everything now we were kind of split apart and that's what we get that we get that saying you know perhaps in a barrel but perhaps in the long in a barrel. And when I see you know you go all the way back to red line and red line was a way for all the resources and taxes to go to certain places where land by you continue to go up and when the rail line mean that's the you know red was the back means it was a slums that African Americans and systematically we've been put in a place where we are supposed to level up it's always take across the level down. So we are a container have conversations with you are so different CEO's been with a more extended CEO zoom calls some time to time and you know we do deep dive in terms of how do we change the narrative and it's more to just change the narrative first you got change the narrative but you got to put action behind it and you have to not be afraid to continue to ruffle some feathers say we got to continue to tackle this and it starts you know with public money and giving back to the inner city communities also was a piece of work. And he was a chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief For every 11 1 1 2 3 4 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 7 4 4 4 5 5 6 4 4 4 5 4 4 6 8 5 4 5 4 5 3 4 5 5 5 6 5 5 5 6 7 6 5 5 6 8 6 7 4 6 7 5 6 6 6 up the weekth of the weekth holiday ahead fra.men the 31 procent in that or something, I think this is the new age of sports tech. I think that the sports industry had been slow to adopt technology and now it's coming in all different types of waves. Obviously we see it on the NFT side. We see it on the consolidation of markets and the media side as well too. And we see it on sports gambling as well too, right? So these are all industries within sports now that are multi-billion dollar industries, sub-industries within sports. Fantastic. Andre, any additional thoughts? Yeah, hit on the hit. I've also had the streaming wars, they're fighting and battling for ground and subscribers and sports is going to play a hard role in that going forward and who's going to be the first one to bid for rights for those main games, those main events. And you got to football, obviously just finished their deal and you've seen an increase in their rights deal. And I think it will increase with so many different players out there looking for that ad revenue and with sports being that only true live content available that brings in a lot of the ad dollars. Yeah, well interesting. Rudy, you mentioned the NFTs and we got a question on that. So Draper or Dapper Labs was mentioned earlier thanks for bringing it up. NFTs are an interesting topic, especially the sports world where you see someone like USC's Evan Mowbally coming out, declaring his MBA draft with an NFT. In your opinion, what's the future of NFTs? Is it a FAD? Is it theirs? Is it a real opportunity for athletes to monetize? Where do you guys see that going? I know it's super early and it's in this infancy right now, but what are your thoughts? Mr. Ego Dawes, the NFT expert here, what I've been like that I was the one who was cold on it. I'm hotter on it now, but I'll get into the floor. Rudy and I are having a lot of healthy conversations on the NFT space. You can go to so many different verticals and on one side, someone's bearish would say, collectibles go through their vats where Bearbrix and Paul, figure rings, which is the art side of collectibles are at its height. When I was a kid, I collected cards. It didn't kind of went away for a little bit and then now it's just exploded back again. You're going through different cycles and is that sustainable, especially in the tech space where you're looking for a continued growth constantly? That's the one thing that investors are looking at. But on the bullish side, you look at the different verticals that you can go down in terms of different engagement with athletes and fans. You've never seen an engagement like this where athletes are a more personalized experience as well. And when you break it down to the consumer, the thing is just a video clip I can see on YouTube. And you can ask someone if you had a goal and you can't take it to the grocery store and buy some food, but you understand it's value. So it's the same thing with these NFTs in the sports space. But it is a more personalized experience for the consumer internet with these athletes. You see athletes being very creative of what the waves are coming out. You're seeing, like you just said, Emma Moley came out and also, she saw the basketball player from Iowa as well. So I'm doing an NFT rollout on CNBC. You don't see many college athletes on CNBC at all. And when we first started speaking, how is the athlete transitioning or how is the athlete? Athlete 2.0 coming along. And you're starting to see a lot of the tech world and a lot of tech ideas being involved with some of the decision making and also how we're thinking about the things we're getting involved. But also the movie Ready Player One. That's there you go right there. We talk about the metaverse. And there's so many different NFT verticals that you can go that route as well, especially with the gaming, the video games with these kids. NBA 2K is one of the largest transactions with our union. With our licensing deal. And a lot of that is the skins is the kids by our infertile shoes. So it goes, you can go further and further and you can go through many more models and it's a lot of possibilities there. Yeah. I have one more thing to state too. Again, this is a hot topic for us. Andre has a really close relationship with the SEO of Dapper and they go back and forth on this. But if anybody has any students have any, has have any keen interest in NFTs or thesis around it. Feel free to email me at arudyatmashtree.vc. I love to hear it. I think that the future is going to be based on scarcity. Everybody's rushing to the market creating these NFTs of the essence of the value of these things was based on scarcity. And now that there might not be as much scarcity. So again, the value of a lot of these NFTs are going to go down considerably. And I think that that remains to be seen as to, you know, again, the overall value of the overall market. But, you know, again, super open to all types of discussions and thesis is right now. It's very much a new frontier so we're interested in learning. Yeah, definitely an exciting space. So let's see here next question. We have time for a couple more here. What do you want your value to be at the cap table and or board member? How do sports and cultural leaders like yourself see your impact in the way the business world thinks? This is something new, right? It's not just plunking money and it's taking either a board seat or being a very active investor. And what does that bring into a kind of one-dimensional just sort of way investors think about a business and creating enterprise value? Well, I think Andre has completely dispelled the notion that athletes can't be investors or know and or aren't thoughtful. It was quite frustrating early on when we were in the space and when they were thinking about just athletes and making a reference to Andre and stuff, that they assumed that he possibly didn't have the busiest acumen to understand anything that it wasn't applied to the consumer marketplace, right? So we tried to dispelled that with a lot of the athletes now that come and invest with us. It's just understanding what's outside the consumer landscape. And they get approached by so many of these consumer companies because that's the obvious thing. Like Andre said before, we've made most of our bones and enterprise software in Fintech. We didn't do consumer deals for the first couple of years because we were frustrated and we were going to learn something different. But we got approached by all the consumer companies, right? So first and foremost, it's just education. And then also being on the cap table, we're African-Americans. Unfortunately, the wealth gaps only increasing nowadays and not enough founders are motivated to have diversity on their cap tables. So we're a CEO speaks to diversity yet doesn't have any representation on their cap table or on their boardroom. Again, it's a massive, it's hypocrisy and a massive contradiction. So again, we're going out there and trying to dispelled those rumors and also trying to educate the CEOs and allow these companies of what the essence of diversity really means. Because many are speaking to it at a very, very surface level and aren't really doing what it really makes sense as to just closing the gap, shall I say, as it attributes to diversity and inclusion. Yeah, cool. I'll be like a time for two final questions, guys. Andre, this one's for you. This is actually a question that I want to ask you as we've been having this discussion and learning more about you and Rudy. But in particular, I've worked on some amazing CEOs throughout my tech career, probably most notably guys like Elon Musk, get Solar City in Tesla. And I just look at his ability to span just such a broad area. And you remind me a lot of him. And I'm wondering how you parse your time with being an absolute world class athlete, world champion, MVP, winner, and then family life, tech, reading Stephen Hawking, and just how do you manage your time and how are you able to accomplish all of that? I'm going to be very honest. I'm still figuring that part out. But I look to certain figures that I can name drop. When I get home too late to my wife to kind of give me some leeway. But I think it's just really focusing the time, really tailoring your time to be very productive. So people talk about social media. I try to use some of my advantage. So I'm on Twitter a lot. But Twitter is my new source. And then I kind of tailor Twitter to constantly feed the things that I need to see and not announce it. So that's helped me tremendously. And that's the advice I give to a lot of players. And I'm constantly when I'm seeing certain people, whether it be a ridicule at Apple or I see Jeff Jordan, I'm always saying, what should I be read? So at last night, we had a three hour flight. And I think that's the beauty of being a professional athlete, is that you're on a plane for a good amount of time. So take a good amount of that time to read. So three hour flight. And I'm spending like two hours, 45 minutes reading. And but that's just become a team. Sometimes I fall off the wagon. But I try to keep that discipline to say, let me be as focused as possible. Rudy is probably one of the hardest working people I know. I make fun of him. I say he works too hard. So there's a competitive nature with me there with him as well as like, I can't let him get too far ahead. He's got the competitive advantage with his degree. But there's a competitive advantage. I'm a catch on one day in terms of knowledge. I can't. So he holds me accountable. Yeah. Well, you're both bad and just, you know, a lot of people say I don't have the time. And you have plenty of time, which is, you're not using it wisely, right? So you got to focus on what your game plan is or you're going to focus your time. So all right, final question, guys. In terms of the convergence of sports plus tech, is there a specific area or vertical where you see the greatest growth potential? I.e. performance, recovery, fan engagement, VR experiences, equipment, et cetera, et cetera? What do you think? Great question. Rudy and I can debate that now. We don't really invest too much into sports because it's like, it's very hard to scale. You know, there's only so many people that play basketball, they really need to know the metrics of the arch or the shop because how many are going to actually make money shooting it perfectly. You know what I mean? And then you can go through different sports, but you look at the health space and that's where you have to change the way you think. So, you know, everyone's an athlete, but which athlete are you tailored to, you know, I think probably times they're in a good job. Yeah. They would think all of them as a hardware company, but they're actually a county company. And you're going into different space, and a couple of companies called Bevels. I don't know, they're waiting, this is crazy now, but the blood sugar levels in terms of tracking, actually your actual health, and I usually move around life. And then you see Apple, putting a ton of money is a bit of a larger watchmaker in the world now with Apple Watch, which is a lot of health benefits behind it. So, in that particular area of sports, I'm looking at more of the healthcare side as opposed to most people would think sports side. Yeah, yeah, Rudy, what do you think? No, I completely agree. This is a conversation that he and I have had for a while now. And again, I think our thesis is graduated over the years where we completely stayed away from it. But again, as Andre said, and he actually really pointed it out and figured it out how sports tech has graduated to the mass market, you know, we stayed away from it because we didn't see, we didn't see the scale. How many sports specific companies, you know, our public companies, right? So we didn't see any exit strategy or upside to it as it should be to the other investments that we were making. But again, now that's definitely changed. And the investments that we're making nowadays again are focused on sports, whereas before we didn't at all. So, yeah. So when we had the creator, the creator economy is coming around right now and we look at platform and Spotify, they're opening up their platforms for a lot of creators to have more skin in the game. Clubhouse is putting in a, they're putting in something where you can pay the whole directly. So you're starting to see, you know, TikTok obviously is doing it and Twitter just wrote out the competitor for Clubhouse. So that's given athletes or people of influence. Athletes, entertainers, more skin in the game as well. So that's Facebook growth too. Yeah, awesome. Well guys, I can't thank you enough for this really enlightening talk. I think that, you know, my big takeaway is just seeing, you know, this combination of like incredible growth mindset combined with an incredible relationship that you guys have put together and just how well-rounded you are, how deep you are, how focused you are, is just, what a great story. I just can't thank you enough for your time. I know the students have been waiting for this talk all quarter long. So I want to thank you and Andre for fascinating discussion Rudy. Thank you. Thanks.
