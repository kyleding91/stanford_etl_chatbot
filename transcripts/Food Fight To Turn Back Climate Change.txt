 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader's series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. On today's episode we have Patrick Brown, the founder and CEO of Impossible Foods. A company that provides nutritious, environmentally friendly alternatives to meat and dairy. One is a world-renowned geneticist, a Howard Hughes medical investigator and the founder of the Public Library of Science, a nonprofit publisher that pioneered the Open Access Business Model. He holds an empty and PhD in biochemistry from the University of Chicago. Here's Patrick. Now, in possible foods for those who aren't familiar, makes meat and dairy products totally from plants. So the idea that is a much smaller environmental footprint than any meat that is produced from animals. And their first product, the Impassal Burger, is sold in more than 40 restaurants and the company is sold. Oh my goodness, news. How many? 300 restaurants? Probably 300 by now. Fabulous, great. And tomorrow it will be 500, okay. And it is privately held and investors include coastal ventures, bill gates and Google ventures. Very impressive. Let's dive in and get them detailed. Maybe you can just start out by telling us about what is the Impassal Burger. Okay, well, first of all, the best way to get the answer is go to the event afterwards. But, yeah, it's a burger that is intended very deliberately to satisfy meat lovers that's the only consumer that we've ever been designing our products for. And it's made entirely from plant ingredients. But it basically delivers the full sensory experience that burger lovers want in terms of flavor, aroma, the cooking experience, if you're cooking it. But it's a, made entirely from plants. And it has a, it's environmental footprint is a tiny fraction of a burger from a cow. So we've done a very detailed and audited analysis and it's producing it, involves one-eighth the greenhouse gas emissions, uses a quarter of the water and less than a 20th of the land area that's required to produce the same thing using a cow, which was motivationally a very important part of it. But what matters to the consumer is that it's absolutely delicious and craveable and don't take my word for it, go to Vienna and decide for yourself. Okay, well, I'm really curious. We've got a lot of people who are engineers in the room. And this also sounds very great from a marketing consumer perspective. But let's talk about the technology. What has made this such a challenge to do? Why are other people not doing this and what are the biggest hurdles that you have to face in making this happen? Wow, okay, that's a lot of questions. So I guess I can't really explain why other people haven't done it except that I think the entire space of possibilities for doing transformative things in the food system is vastly under-explored, relative to its potential and its importance. And I think there's been very little real innovation in the traditional food industry. And the notion that so we started with the idea that it should be possible to make meat. And by meat, I mean what I define it in the way that consumers define it. The flavor experience, the cooking experience, the whole sensory experience, nutritional value and affordability and so forth, to make meat better in all those measures than a cow can do it or then the existing technology can do it. Basically, that the technology that we've been using up to now to make meat is fundamentally limited and it's also completely unsustainable. But it's just a technology problem. We've kind of conflated the products with the way we make them. We use animals to make these products. But the value to consumers and we actually have data on this has nothing to do with the fact they're made from animals. You don't love meat because it's made from animals. You love it in spite of the fact that it's made from animals. And the using animals that technology is fundamentally limited. How did not evolve as a meat production technology? They were incidentally taken advantage of as a meat production technology that if you approach the problem as saying, we have to deliver a particular kind of sensory experience to consumers and nutritional value and versatility and affordability in a particular form factor and blah, blah, blah. But we want to do it with a blank slate basically and with the goal of massively reducing the environmental footprint. And we want to do a better job than the existing technology can do. Well that's completely what's, that makes perfect sense to me anyway. And it's kind of like the same thing with transportation 200 years ago. 200 years ago people if you said, I'm going to make the cart move faster without using the horse, they think you are crazy. Because people conflated the particular way they made the cart moves with the kind of universe of possibilities. But when you step away from that, you realize that actually you can avoid all the limitations of the existing technology. You can get rid of the limitations of the existing technology and there's vast possibilities for improving it. So anyway, that's fine. I love that analogy honestly about the cart and the horse. I think that is so fascinating. It's interesting to think though about how did you make this decision to do this, right? You were a professor here for 25 years. You had a very comfortable job doing research. What made you want to leave to solve this problem? What was the aha that you said, you know, I need to go and leave academics to go solve this problem? First of all, so I had, I love my job and I love Stanford and everyone that I knew and worked with here. But I never defined myself as a biochemistry professor or something like that. It just happened to be what I was doing at the time. And I always felt like I want to do the most important and impactful, meaningful thing that I can do given the things that I know I do. And for a long while, it was trying to develop a better, basic understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that keep cells alive and how genes work and stuff like that, both as pure knowledge and also because that's kind of like the foundation for being able to develop better ways of treating and diagnosing disease and so forth. So I thought, okay, that's pretty impactful and I was happy doing that. But I had a sabbatical and I had the opportunity to basically just step back from it and ask myself, okay, what right now is the most important problem in the world that I can potentially contribute to solving. And I realized very quickly that the most important and urgent problem in the world in my very strong opinion, full stop, is the destructive impact of our use of animals as food production technology, which not just according to me, but according to you, you an environmental program and many other environmental scientists, is by a big margin the most environmentally destructive technology on earth. And so, okay, that's easy. So that's the problem. And it took me a while to come around to realizing that the solution involved starting a business. In fact, when I got into that thought process, it was like the farthest thing from my mind. But I realized that no one was taking this seriously as a solvable problem. I even went to the COP21 conference two years ago and it was all these people who live in breathe climate change and not a word. I mean, I basically, I think, was the only person in the entire city of Paris who was talking about the animals in our food system as a major cause of climate change. And yet, if you talked to anyone there, they'd say, yeah, of course it really is. But it was on no one's agenda. Why? Because for billions of people around the world, the foods that we get from animals are such an important part of the pleasure of living, that it's too much of a stretch to contemplate basically leaving those foods behind. Even for people who live in breathe these kind of environmental issues. And so you have this dilemma that billions of people and rapidly increasing demand for these foods and the way we're making them is completely unscathed. I mean, the magnitude of the environmental impact don't get me started, but is humongous. How do you solve that dilemma? You basically separate the things that people demand and desire, which is the functional properties of these foods, flavor, you know, all the things that you love about those foods from the way we make them. And I felt like, okay, actually, if you do that, that's a solvable problem. And that what it enables you to do is that it should be possible to do is to create products that outperform in every way that consumers care about the products that we get from animals, much more sustainably basically deconstructing the problem and making these products directly from plant ingredients. And if we then just put them on the market and let the market work, let consumers make the choice. And it's on us to make a product that's so good that people choose over the existing products. But if we can pull that off, we solve the problem and potentially a very fast pace. We set our target as basically, this is our internal strategic target. We want to effectively completely replace the USVAMILs, the food production technology by 2035. And I think that the only way you can do that, the only system fast enough to make that happen is the market and products that outperform. So I know that other people are tackling this in other ways, for example, trying to grow meat in the lab, right? Actually, not using an animal to grow the meat, but doing it in a laboratory setting, you're growing muscle. So what do you think about that as an alternative? Well, first of all, I feel like anyone who is seriously trying to tackle the same problem that we're working on, as far as I'm concerned, I wish them all possible success. As far as scientific standpoint, I think it's really a terrible idea, because the problem is that for fundamental reasons, there is just absolutely no way to make it economically competitive with the incumbent system. I would like in it to, I would say, an easier way of doing it. An in vitro growing animals from stem cells to size and blah, blah, blah, is a harder way of doing it than if you start with a fetal calf, you knock out its immune system because these cells don't have an immune system. And feed it intravenously for its entire life in the ICU, that's easier than taking a further step back and you have to create the fetal calf from stem cells and then grow it up and still in the ICU without an immune system. So that's just, I think, you know, but I hope that I hope I'm wrong about this, but I know I'm not. Well, I guess time will tell, right? I also think that there's a fundamental fallacy here, which is that the problem was the failure to disconnect the food from the way we've been making it, not fully disconnecting it. And an analogy that I would make is if 200 years ago people had made the same mistake, they would have said, okay, the way to kind of replace a horse in transportation is, well, culture horse muscle cells and we'll hook them up to gears and pulleys and that's new and improved transportation system because you haven't recognized that no, there's nothing about the horse that you need for this and there's nothing about the cow that you need for me to make. So what do you need? Okay, so what makes this burger, which I've had a chance to try and what makes it so unique as opposed to other sort of veggie burgers? Why, what is the secret sauce that makes this taste and feel just like a regular burger? So, again, I'm terrible at giving simple answers, but the basic secret sauce is that we have an amazing group of scientists and engineers, a very large group who have worked for years on this problem and started out basically saying, step one, in order to make meat that's better than the cow, first we have to really understand how the cow does it. What is the, so to speak, the molecular mechanism of meatiness, understand how meat works as food in fundamental terms so that then we could very deliberately find much more sustainable, instead of ingredients to deliver those functional properties by understanding what the underlying biochemistry is. So in a sense, that's, the secret sauce was, I think we approach this the way it should be approach, which is a fundamental scientific problem. And I'll just say, we spend probably a thousand as much money on fundamental research aimed at improving the food system. I mean, just treating as a fundamental scientific problem, then we do on cancer. But the impact on the world is vastly greater. Even if you just look at deaths from malnutrition or bad nutrition and so forth, are greater than all the deaths from cancer, but that's not even concerning the environmental impacts and all the other health impacts and so forth. And yet, there's been virtually no research on this. So the secret sauce was basically respecting this as an important scientific problem and doing it hard, but actually, ingredient-wise, we had to find proteins that performed as major muscle proteins do not moving animals around, but in terms of what happens when you cook them. And it's important for textural transformations and juiciness and stuff like that. And probably the single most important kind of headline thing was we discovered how the molecular mechanism by which the flavor of meat is generated and not just beef, but all meats. And it turns out that it's basically because meat has everything we call animal tissues have very high levels of molecule called heme. Heme is the molecule that makes your blood red, that carries oxygen, your blood. It's iron-containing. It's the thing that makes meat a great source of iron. And it's basically found in every form of life and it's without heme, you would not be able to benefit from oxygen in the air. So basically, when your body takes in some biochemical way advantage of molecular oxygen from the atmosphere, virtually always, it does so by means of a heme as a cofactor. Okay, that's too much in the weeds on heme. But basically animals use a lot more oxygen than plants and bacteria and stuff like that in general. And so to manage all that, they have hundreds to a thousand times more heme than a typical plant does. And the very high abundance of heme is what sets meat apart in terms of flavor and aroma and so forth. And that's because besides being involved in all these oxygen transactions, heme is a great, promiscuous catalyst of chemical reactions. And so the chemical reactions in meat that take all the simple nutrients like fats and amino acids, and vitamins, and sugars that are found in every living cell, but turn them into that unique explosion of flavor and aroma are catalyzed by heme. And that was something that our team discovered. Amazingly, something that I would have thought in retrospect, how could this not be already widely known given how meat is so important to people and the flavor of meat is so distinctive and heme is just like in there staring at you, but it had never been discovered before. And so we were able to get patents on it and all of that. Yeah. Could I take a heme and put it in something else and give that same experience? I mean, why do I have to put the entire meat experience? Why do I have to, can't I put it in a carrot? Yeah, okay. I mean, and that's the same experience of meat and say, wow, the carrot becomes more appealing. I'm healing the carrot. The answer. So, okay, so it turns out that heme is also important for like, it's the critical, for fish flavor. It's also the critical catalyst. It's pretty much, except for dairy products, I think the unique flavors of things we get from animals are largely unique because of heme. But you get different flavor profiles. And so you can take heme and put it in a different mixture of other kind of basic nutrient molecules, biomolecules, and get different flavor profiles out of it. I mean, the reason why fish tastes like fish and terrestrial animal meat tastes different from that is basically because fish have these polyensaturated fats that they get from algae and heme catalyzed reactions that turn those into flavor molecules and the role of molecules and stuff like that. So the different precursors affect the flavor outcome. And this isn't actually for the future for us. I think a great area for exploration is, you know, right now the space of possibilities of meaty animal flavors that are out there are just defined by the animals that happen to have been domesticated or whatever or even just happen to live on earth. But once you kind of know what the basic flavor chemistry is like, now that whole space is open for exploration. And my guess is that we'll be able to create some really great, amazing, interesting flavors in that broad space with new substrates. Carrots are not sure are going to be the best choice but it would be a very interesting experiment. I think you need a bunch of small molecule precursors. Actually, you know, there's even an interesting thing. One of the major ingredients in carrots in combination with heme produces the flavor of egg yolk. So that's... We're talking about the carrot team. So, yeah. So anyway, it wouldn't be a crazy experiment to do it actually. Yeah, we can do that. Okay. Okay, we got to do that. We got to do that. Okay. Okay, I'll come over and try it. Yeah. So what is your source of heme? Where do you get it from? So we produce it using an engineer G strain that synthesizes the team using the same... This yeast strain can make its own heme and it needs the heme that makes to live its life. We've turbocharged its own heme production machinery so that it makes insane amounts of heme. And we've also introduced a plant gene because heme... Heme basically only works the way it's supposed to work when it's bound by a protein. And we needed a protein that was essentially very functionally similar to the protein that binds the heme in animal tissue in muscle, which is myoglobin. And we found one. It's naturally found in the root nodules of nitrogen fixing plants. And we thought we might be able to isolate it by digging up the root nodules from the US soybean crop and isolating it. Actually, on paper, that seems like a good solution. In practice, it was as we learned painfully, completely, in practical way of doing it. And so we switched to producing it in yeast. And that's a very scalable system and way more sustainable and more food safe than producing it with cows. Okay, so I want to flash back again. I'm going to go back in time. You've got this idea. You've got this aha. And I understand you jumped on your bike and rode over to the node coastal softwares. Jumped on it. That's when, well, okay, you got on your bike. I'm visualizing this. Oh my gosh, I'm going to ride over to the node coastal's office and show him my pitch deck. And you walked out with $7 million. Yes, roughly. So what did you say to him? What did you say to him? What was it that got him so excited that he said, okay, I've got to do this. What we learned from you. I don't want to speak for Vinode. He might give a different answer for what it was. I mean, basically, what I said to him was, and I should say, for business people here, the pitch that I gave him in retrospect was ridiculous. Because I had never been in the business world. I had no experience with this kind of stuff. And I had been introduced to Vinode by a scientist friend of mine. We said, oh, Vinode will be very interested in this project. And so, basically, most of my presentation was about how hugely important this problem was to solve. Of we have to find a better technology than animals for producing these foods because it's so insanely destructive. And I have, and I absolutely believe it can be done. And I have some sketchy ideas about how it might be done if you give me the money. And, oh, by the way, the global market for these products is $1.5 trillion. And ever since then, I say this, but it's not a joke, it's true, that final slide gets closer to the front of the deck, as I learned more and more about how business works. And I don't know what part of that presentation he was sold. I think he did care about the environmental impact. I think the fact that I could say him, look him straight in the eye, which I did, actually. And I said, I literally more or less said this, I promise to make you even more insanely rich than you already are if you give me this money. And seriously, because I felt like I'm not taking charity here, I need the money that you're going to give me, and I'm going to try to accomplish something, and my reasons for accomplishing it may be very different from yours, but you're going to come out okay financially if we do this. Anyway, so he was a good enough sport to give me the money and... Great. I love the idea that, and it's something that we teach our students a lot, is you know, fall in love with the problem, not the solution, right? So you presented him with a big, hairy problem, and you said, this is a problem I care deeply about, and I'm committed to solving it, even though the path might be somewhat circuitous. Yes, I think it was important that I could... The fact that I knew I wasn't bullshitting, actually, I think is really important. Like I feel like I could look him honestly in the eye and say, this is going to work out really well for your investors and so forth. My reasons for doing it, you know, like I said, are completely different. I want to solve this problem and stuff like that, but if it was going to be a charitable cause, you know, these guys wouldn't have invested, so obviously that was a big part of it. But the determination, I think this is really important. I don't want to read the node's mind, but I think it mattered to him that I am completely determined to solve this problem. You know, I'm not going to quit until we've achieved our mission, which is to replace this technology, and he knew I was telling the truth because I was. So what does success look like to you? Paint a picture of what success looks like. Well, basically, it's that number one, we are no longer using animals as a food production technology. Number two, as a consequence. Like at all. Like they're gone. Practical purposes. I'm not saying that some guy in Malawi may still be taking care of his goat. No, seriously, I don't want to be like black and white about this, but I'm saying for all practical purposes, that technology is obsolete. And actually, in a certain way, we're hoping that we can say a year from now, that cows are an obsolete way to produce beef. That we can demonstrably produce a better product than a cow. But anyway, that's a bit off the track. But success, what does success look for us? Okay, that's the mechanism. But the consequences are we should be able to, first of all, right now, 45% of Earth's land area is according to the International Livestock Research Institute, which is an NGO devoted to livestock farming, is actively in use, was actively in use in 2011, either raising feed crops or being used for grazing livestock. 45%, that's an area bigger than North America, South America, Europe, and Australia combined. So, if we, and we ought to be able to replace all the ingredients used in all the meat, fish, and dairy foods, not just the terrestrial ones, but meat, fish, and dairy foods worldwide, using an area, using technology that we already started to work with, with about 2% of Earth's land area, which means that we will recover for other purposes, 40% plus of the entire land area of Earth. And that's huge. And what could we do with it? Well, you know, a lot of it used to be forests, it used to be natural grasslands. If we restored native ecosystems, we could potentially reverse the catastrophic meltdown in wildlife populations, almost entirely driven by the use of animals of food production technology, their exploitation or habitat destruction, allow wildlife populations to recover. There's a catastrophic meltdown less. We have less than half as many living wild animals on Earth than we did 40 years ago. Overwhelmingly due to the use of animals of food production technology. So, we could reverse that. The other thing that's really interesting for people who are interested in geoengineering to deal with climate change, is that the best technology that we know about, as far as I'm concerned, for removing carbon from the atmosphere as photosynthesis. And if we allowed the vegetation that was originally on that land 150 years ago, just to recover to the state it was 150 years ago, we would pull out of the atmosphere, and there's very good data on this. We would pull out of the atmosphere an amount of carbon dioxide that's equivalent to 15 years ago. It's equivalent to 15 years worth of greenhouse gas emissions at 2016 rates. We could turn back the clock on atmosphere greenhouse gases. You'd reach a new steady state, so it's not like you're just going to pull all the CO2 out of the air down to zero. But you'll reach a new steady state and buy yourself a lot of time to find more definitive solutions. So, that's another thing that would happen. We said early on that we would define our success by looking at satellite photos of the Earth, and looking at the recovery of ecosystems, and that's what success looks like to us. So, I understand, I read about the fact that you were one of the first people when you were in medical school to say you wouldn't do tests on animals while you were in med school. Do you do tests on animals now? Well, I was the first person in my particular medical school to refuse to do it. I'll just say that pretty much every single medical school in the world in the meantime has realized that was a completely ridiculous thing to do and useless. So, in the end, I was vindicated, although I was made to do some penance for... I'm curious, do you have to work with animals? Do you have to test on animals? Well, that's the question. So, what you're referring to is, in order to achieve our mission, we need to have products that are both from a regulatory standpoint and from a consumer acceptance standpoint, demonstrably safe foods. And from a regulatory standpoint, in particular, FDA and other counterparts in Europe and other places and so forth, essentially require that for new ingredients, like the him protein that we're using, you cannot get their sign-off on safety unless you do animal toxicology tests. So, we tried... we started talking to the FDA five years ago or something like that. And we put together what we thought was a compelling case. We and other experts, a compelling case for why we didn't need to do those tests to establish the safety of this protein. To biochemists, it's a no-brainer and to toxicologists. But anyway, but from a regulatory standpoint, they said, no, you have to do these rat toxicology tests. So, we did. And for me, that was a terrible problem because I don't even want to get into it, but for... From a... as a model, as a scientific model for the types of things that they're used for, I think that most animal models are ridiculous. And they're terrible. And they give results that are not only not reliable, but they give false confidence in some case. So, that's one thing. But I also consider it basically from my perspective, unethical, unless there's some absolutely compelling reason. So, I don't... you know, I'm not like saying never use animals... Like if someone I loved, their life depended on me doing some tests on a rat or something like that. I do it in a heartbeat. So, it's not like I'm categorical about this. But for things that are unnecessary, I consider it absolutely unethical to use animals for these tests. This was necessary because if we're going to achieve our mission, we need to be able to sell our product. And in order to sell our product, we need the regulatory approval. And in order to get the regulatory approval, we need to do these tests. And by every measure in terms of the greater good for the world, this is what we had to do. But we weren't thrilled about it or I wasn't thrilled about it. So, I'm going to open it up to questions from the audience in just a minute. So, please think about your burning questions. So, here you were a scientist for 25 years at a research scientist professor. What about that role prepared you to run a company like this? I mean, did you feel like that was a nice training ground or did you feel like you had to totally retool in order to do this? You know, it's really hard to say. I mean, I feel like there's a bunch of the experience that I had at Stanford, I think, was extremely helpful for it. It's a little bit hard to parse it out, but I'd say you have to choose really important, really difficult, challenging, and interesting problems in order to be able to, first of all, for me to be able to motivate to work on them. Also, if you do that, if you can choose those kinds of problems, you can get amazingly great people to come join you and work on them. So, my lab was successful, I think, largely because the problems that we were working on were important and interesting and challenging enough that great people wanted to come work on them. So, that's one thing. I guess, and definitely, my style compared to a typical business, I think, is much more wanting to identify problems and suggest, you know, work with people to help them solve them and suggest solutions and stuff like that. I'm not very good at the kind of top-down, managerial type of thing that you need for businesses, but fortunately, I know where to find them, like Stanford Business School. So, that's another thing, is that I feel like, you know, I definitely learned at Stanford what I'm good at and things that I'm very not good at. And so, that helped me understand, like, I really need to fill those deficiencies by getting really great people to fill them. I don't know, you also learn how to try to convince people to give you money, because that's how you fund your lab and so forth. And I guess something else which fortunately hasn't been called into use yet, but I'm sure will, is that, you know, when you're trying to do really hard stuff and really do stuff that's outside the box and people aren't used to, you're going to have a lot of doubters. And I had the experience when I was at Stanford, I wrote a grant proposal that I thought was, and I still do the best grant proposal I'd ever written. And when I got the review back, it was the worst priority score I'd ever seen, not just on my grant proposals, but on any grant proposal. And I went ahead and did it, and it was a huge success, and it was the best kind of, you know, overall thing my lab had done. And so forth. So I feel like perseverance, I'd say, is another really good thing. And to do really interesting stuff, you know, you're motivated because the goal is interesting, but you also have to do some really uninteresting stuff to get there. And there's a lot of these hard research problems, you know, it's really exciting when you get the results, but a lot of getting there is like doing very repetitive stuff and so forth. So I guess being used to, recognizing you have to persevere through boring stuff, gets the big one. Right, super. Okay, who has a burning question? And I'm going to focus on student, Taty. So you said no to clean me, but how are you going to infiltrate the market and develop a country full of the possible burger or possible chicken or possible fish? Knowing that in these countries, I mean production is interesting and people are proud of consuming more meat. So clean, it would be the actual meat that people want and the possible burger would not be the item. Well, I think there's an embedded assumption. Can you repeat the question? Oh, yes, sorry. The question was, how do we expect to be successful? Tell me if I'm answering. In international markets, where the assumption is that real meat can only come from animals, I guess. And therefore the way that we make our meat won't be viewed as the product that they want because it doesn't come from animals. I think that that's an embedded assumption, which I don't happen to share. I think if you make a product that in terms of delivering the fundamental things that people want from that product, which is the pleasure of eating it, which is, you know, for a lot of people all around the world, that's like one of the great pleasures of life. If you deliver that and you can produce it at a cost that is attractive and it delivers the nutrition and so forth, I think in my view, you're there. I would someone say, you know, anywhere in the world. Yes, this product doesn't taste as good. Yeah, it's not as good for you. Yeah, it's more expensive. But it's made from animal cells, so I'm going to buy it anyway. I just don't buy that at all. I think it would be just like people saying, you know, I'm going to wait for cars that are powered by horse muscle cells because that's really, you know, that's the transportation system I aspire to. They aspire to it because that's been the only way to make it up to now. But I think it's the product and the way you make it, I think people can easily separate those things. Okay, great. Over back here. Stand up, please. I was wondering, looking at creating a meat that, you know, performs also in terms of like macro molecules the same way as actual animal meat. Have you thought at all about moving more towards like other animal parts such as dairy that have like really disturbing links to health impacts and also does the impossible burger have the same sort of like negative health components like trans fats and cholesterol. So can I just repeat it? So the question is, have you considered dairy, which also has a lot of issues, and have you considered the other health issues around meat with like cholesterol? Yes and yes. So, yeah, when I found out the company, our goal was not to replace meat production, it was to replace animals, the food production technology. And when we started working on technology platform, it was relatively agnostic as to what product it would be for. And we were of course actively interested in dairy as a target. And in fact, in the first year that we existed just based on some work actually most of which I had done before I started the company, we actually spun off a company that's making plant based dairy products called kite hill makes cheeses and yogurts and stuff like that. We spun it off because basically although it's a great company and the products are great and you know, they're selling very well, you're not going to change the world by making products that as these were are made using almonds as a precursor because it's just the economics don't work. So, but we're looking expensive. Yeah, it's basically you're not going to be able to be cost competitive and so I felt like but still it was you know, it's a very successful in selling and stuff. But anyway, that's in the side. We cared about dairy, but we had at some point once we felt like we had the basic know how about you know how to make products in this space and we had toolkit you know, at least a starting toolkit. We had to make a choice because we can't launch 10 products at once. And we had to choose what are we going to launch with and for us the ground beef was an obvious choice. And I think actually it's interesting when you think about the dairy business. If we're successful in making a product that can out compete ground beef from a cow in the marketplace, that actually is very disruptive to the dairy industry because that's where those cows wind up and it's actually a non trivial fraction of you know of their revenue is is from selling the you know older cows and whatever. As meat and if we can take away that market it's disruptive to that industry, but we're also working on milk where we early on we had some actually very cool cheese prototypes we just decided we didn't have the bandwidth market them but we'll definitely be launching dairy products when we have the bandwidth. Thank you for your talk. Going back to focusing on the problem of impossible food is plant-based solution Tina mentioned lab grown meat. What are if there's any other solutions to this $1.4 trillion problem. So the question is we talk about growing the lab as well as reverse engineering it. Are there other solutions people are attempting? Yeah, I think that's a very interesting question. I don't know of any categorically different solutions people are attempting. I think that there's something that is going to be part of our strategy down the road. We start up by producing a product that very clearly was targeted at replacing a particular existing product by delivering the things that people want from that particular existing product. Another strategy might have been well if we have something that is categorically unlike that product but that will in terms of people's eating and purchasing habits compete successfully against it might not be exactly or even close to like meat but nutritionally it feels the same spot and in terms of the taste that satisfies it's similar. That's a very real possibility and something that we're definitely thinking about down the road. But if we're talking about different technologies for producing food in this space. I think there are other, for example, you could produce your ingredients entirely by fermentation or by other means. And the question of whether you do that just comes down to which is the most scalable and economical way of doing it. And because plants are very efficient at producing biomass directly using sunlight and air and nutrients from the soil, it's hard to beat that in terms of the fundamental economics. That's why we thought and the fact is they're loaded with a huge diversity of potential to protein and small molecule tools and so forth. We felt like there'd be enough there and that that was but there are other, that's a good question. Back it back. I actually wanted to ask some of the previous questions or sorry answers to that. If you could theoretically modify plants you can do that at the production or I guess that's hardest instead of at the end which is sort of what companies like the possible foods and beyond meat do. So you want plants that grow meat? Yeah, yeah, just make plants more similar to meat when they grow out of the ground instead of do the process at the end. And do you want to do my question? Yeah, yeah, do it. Okay, sure. So my question is, so a lot of the times you mentioned both the ethics about caring about animal, sensory farming, environmental aspects of meat. A lot of times those meat prioritized differently. So for example, theory has a very bad effect on our environment but it's also not, it's pretty negligible compared to other animal products in how it affects the number of animals. So how do you sort of prioritize those two? I mean, first of all, I feel like in general both of those things are synergistic in terms of reasons to do this. Like, so what you're just saying is in both cases they're both really good reasons to do all the stuff that we're doing but the effect of them and the decision is different for different products. And I would say that by and large we're focusing on environmental impact as the key metric. And even if you're just talking thinking about it from an animal welfare standpoint, basically in terms of the destructive impact on animals on planet earth, the destruction of habitats and you know on the numbers is a huge factor there. So even just if you're just saying let's just focus on minimizing the environmental impact you're you're accomplishing a lot there. Anyway, that's just so you're just asking how do we take those considerations into account in priorities. I'd say most of the time they're not in competition and to the extent they ever are will probably lead toward the environmental impact side. So let me ask another question here. So we had a program recently that was really mind blowing to me. It was about it was a workshop that we did on entrepreneurship in the food industry. It was just amazing to think about how every type of technology is touches the food industry and there's so much room for innovation. What are other areas of the food industry that you are most excited about seeing really big innovations? Well, I would say in terms of just from a brainstorming perspective on what the possibilities are, I think that you know the foods that we currently have if you think about the kind of high dimensional space of possibilities and all the ways foods can be different in flavor and texture and all that sort of stuff. The foods we have right now are just tiny, tiny few points in that space and there's a huge possibility I think for exploring it and making it hard in the new food. So that's very interesting from a just brainstorming theoretical standpoint. From a mission standpoint where there's a huge potential for innovation in the way we produce the raw materials for food. So for example, you know, one of the things that we're spending some effort on is premised on the idea that the major protein for human nutrition is going to be a protein that right now is a negligible fraction of the human diet and is not even considered when people think about nutrition. It's a protein called rubisco, it's the most abundant protein on earth, it's the 40-ish percent of the total protein content of any leaf and that's partly why it's super abundant. Believably great nutritional properties, great functional properties and so forth. The problem is that it's concentration, you know, like there's protein in spinach and most of that is rubisco and so plants have non-trivial amount of protein. But in order to get enough of it in your diet you'd have to eat ridiculous amounts of cellulose which your body's not adapted to digesting so that's why we don't do it. But if you say, well, actually we don't have to eat these plants in the native form. If they've got a valuable ingredient we can figure out how to isolate it and scale it and so forth. And the reason why this is so interesting is that there are ways that you could, if you could economically scale a process for isolating it in a functional and food-safe form, you could produce all the protein that the world needs in 2050. But in 2050 with a couple of percent of earth's land area just growing alfalfa and isolating rubisco from the leaves which is actually an idea that we're actively pursuing. And another even wilder idea which nobody at the company takes seriously but I think some day I think is maybe feasible but it is a long shot. And the reason why this is so important is that 45% of the photosynthetic productivity on earth is phytoplankton. And unlike terrestrial plants their life cycles are really really fast like a couple of days. So if you harvest a billion phytoplankton they restore their numbers in a few days. So if you have a couple of irrigation no fertilizers or no pesticides and less than a percent of their productivity would meet all human calorie and protein requirements. So to me that nobody wants to eat plankton per se. Unless you're a whale. And that's actually the interesting thing is that people don't think of plants very seriously as a protein source but for most living organisms on earth they are the entire source of protein. Most of the protein in the diet of animals categorically on earth come directly from plants and a large fraction that are phytoplankton. Anyway point is if you have a way of isolating out the valuable nutrients from those things and using them to make foods that deliver the pleasures that people want that's a whole new game. It's technically very trivial to very non trivial to figure out a way to harvest these things economically and sustainably and so forth. But to me it's like a very valuable thought experiment and something that years from now when we have the resources I want to pursue. And I just will say one thing people will often say well that isn't that kind of like very processed to isolate ingredients from phytoplankton to turn them into meat and so forth. But I'll just say that everything in the food system basically the whole history of food is figuring out what parts of what plants and animals are delicious and nutritious and good to eat. So just flopping them on the plate figuring out ways of preparing them and combining them that makes something that's more than the sum of the parts that's the whole history of food and that's what we're talking about doing. It's definitely not at all deviant in that sense. I'm a person regarding the urban versus rural divide that makes this with this product. Particularly since the launch of a possible birder is a very urban very liberal idea idea ideologically centered areas. What does the azurement any perception has been varying sort of testing done by impossible in terms of this particular meat product not necessarily by coder meat that has certainly wildly different view points. I would say we haven't systematically looked at urban versus rural. We've sort of unsystematically got some data on it that I would say is encouraging in a lot of ways. First of all I would say that we have data compelling data that basically says what matters about just say what matters about meat is the sensory pleasures the pleasure you get from eating and the credibility, the nutrition and the cost. That's what people are focusing on. For most Americans and we didn't focus heavily on rural but in the sampling it was broadly geographic across the US. The large majority love their meat not because it's made from animals but in spite of the fact that it's made from animals and would actually prefer and pay a premium for an identical product just because it's made from plants instead of the food. And that's across the country and by a large margin which isn't to say that that's uniformly true but my guess is that the thought experiment is doesn't matter where you are if someone says here's your choice. A product that is inferior in flavor and nutrition and cost more but happens to be made from animals versus a product that is better in flavor and nutrition and less expensive and is made from plants. I would say the vast majority of people no matter where they are would make that second choice but we'll have to find out. The other thing is that if the concern is that somehow this is disruptive to rural economies which is a legitimate concern I'll just say that we share that concern and this is not, you know, this is, we're trying to create a product and then consume this juice. We're not attacking anyone here but we recognize that it would have that impact and we're actively looking at ways to integrate with the existing system and not completely replace that was a food technology that's for sure but not kick out the people who are working on it. So here you are in the middle of this very exciting journey but if you flash back to when you were a student and you were sitting in a lecture hall like this what do you wish someone had told you what do you wish you knew when you were 20? I have a question. A lot of things. What sort of general advice, not about what sort of general advice do you wish someone had given you? To some degree it was my phenotype from the get go but it's definitely been something that has been reinforced repeatedly by experience and that would be don't waste your life on things that don't matter and you know, of course there are limits set on you by the fact that you have to make a living and you happen to live some particular place and whatever resources and all of that but don't set limits on the kinds of things that you can do. The reason that nobody has done this before isn't because no one could have done it. It's because nobody decided that actually it's I'm going to make it happen and it's in other words it's because people made the assumption that the fact that hasn't happened means it can't be done or something like that. So I feel like one thing I would just say is I don't know don't cap your own ambition do things that really matter for the world. I feel like that's what you're going to be proud of when you're you know geyser like me and you know do things that will make the world better if you're going to have kids for your kids and grandkids. I sort of felt that way but early in my when I was 20 I was kind of still in the mode of sort of sort of sleep walking through you know the kind of academic trajectory and stuff like that. I hadn't fully formed that but and I feel like in a way if I hadn't started from that philosophy earlier I would have spent more time in my career at Stanford doing what I did six years ago just stepping back and saying okay I'm just going to completely look again start over what's the most important thing I could be doing now. Well that is totally terrific and we wish you the best of luck please join me in thanking Patrick.
