 This is the Entrepreneurial Thought Layer Series brought to you by Stanford Equal. Welcome everybody to the Entrepreneurial Thought Layer seminar at Stanford University, the Stanford seminar for aspiring entrepreneurs. ETL is presented by STVP, the Stanford Engineering Entrepreneurship Center, and basis the Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students. I'm Ravi Blani, a lecturer in the Management Science and Engineering Department at Stanford, the Director of Alchemist and Accelerator for Enterprise Startups. And today I have the pleasure of welcoming Ali Goadsie to ETL. Ali is an adjunct professor in computer science at UC Berkeley and the CEO and co-founder of Databricks, a leader in data and AI. How many people are familiar with Databricks? In general, okay, fantastic. So, Ali was born in Iran during the country's revolution and later his family, who were part of the opposition, fled to Sweden to escape persecution during the Iran Iraq War. He learned to code as a kid, just as a hobby, on a Commodore 64. And then he went on to study and got an MBA and a master's in computer engineering for mid-Swedish university in Sweden. And then a PhD in three years in computer science from KTH, the Royal Institute of Technology, with a focus on complete decentralized, well as that gesture, complete decentralized computer systems. We then got him over to California when he came out on a post-doc at UC Berkeley. And while at Berkeley, he was part of a small team that created the open source project, Apache Spark, which was a groundbreaking tool for crunching big sets of data for analysis and transformation. He's described himself in a previous article on the small team that he was with when they created Spark as a bunch of Berkeley hippies who just wanted to change the world and give the product away for free. But in 2013, he jumped into commercial ventures and entrepreneurship when he and six co-founders jumped in and launched Databricks, which was a company that would commercialize Spark. He started as the VP of Engineering and Product Management, but then transitioned to the CEO of the company three years after its founding. Databricks is now valid at over $43 billion. It has over 8,000 employees. According to Forbes, by Ben Horowitz's own admission, Oli is the best CEO in Andreessen Horowitz's portfolio. So to learn about how this hippie became a true maverick in venture-backed entrepreneurship, please welcome Oli. Awesome. By the way, Ben also said that the pitch deck was the worst I have ever witnessed in my whole career. We walked out saying this is the worst pitch deck we've ever seen. Well, and so that's a testament to these innate skills you have to change and improve. And so I really wanted one pack that because I think this is such inspiration. Everybody here in this room is an academia by virtue of being in this class. Everybody in this room is interested in entrepreneurship by virtue of being in this class. You went deep into academia. You were a PhD in an adjunct professor. And then you went deep into succeeding in entrepreneurship too. And so there's some innate skills that you possess inside that we want to unlock. We're limited on time. The interest is going to far exceed the time that we have. So let's jump in. There's a couple things that I think are particularly unique about Databricks and Oli's story. The first of which is that you had seven co-founders when you started Databricks. I have never heard of a company that's gotten to the size that you guys have with seven co-founders. And so I want to first click on that and understand advice for aspiring founders on how they should think about co-founders. First of all, are all seven co-founders still at the company? Kind of more or less. We're kind of best friends, but I would say two or not really act super active. But we're great. I mean, there's seven of us that like super tight knit. And so can you share any advice for aspiring founders on how they should think about co-founders? Who's the right person that makes a co-founder? How do you preserve good co-founder relationships? I don't know if you can talk about aligning incentives with your co-founders. Can you share? Yeah, I mean, we could just discuss this the rest of the time. We're on out of time. You know, a lot of building companies end up being, I mean, initially it's like about the product market fit and what you're building and all that kind of stuff. But a lot of it is also how do you work with other human beings? And as you scale the business, it's going to be even more how do you work with other humans? And one thing that's really, really important that's not emphasized, I think, in business books and whatnot is that it actually boils down to trust. Do you trust another human being? Right? So it's like just, it's that. That's it. So do you trust your co-founders? Do they trust you? It's as simple as that. And it has nothing to do with business or anything like that. Do you trust that human being? Are they going to stab you in the back? Are they going to do the right thing? Do you trust that they can do the right thing? Do you trust that they're just going to be able to handle that if you just delegate that to them? You know, all those kind of things. So it all comes back to human trust. So if you can do that well, I think it's amazing to have seven co-founders because we're sort of like best friends. We trust each other in a way that we can't trust any other human being on the planet. We've been through, I feel like we've been through war together and survived it. But also seven co-founders could mean, and we had some of this also in the early days of Databricks, could mean constant in fighting. And why should I have that? You have that title. What do I have that title? I mean, you were to see your brother. So I'm not seeing you. Oh, whatever. What's going on? It could be a lot of stuff like that. A lot of drama. You find out. So you see a lot of companies where there's a lot of drama in the founding team. And it's very, very usual that like, you know, one of the founders bombs out, leaves, bark their own competing endeavor. There's a lot of these stories out there as well. And it all comes down to, can you build trust? I love that heuristic. And that's different than the bar for an employee. Yeah. So trust is the founder bar. They have to pass that bar of trust. Yes. And then can you talk about equity? Did you just split the equity evenly across all seven? Was that an issue on deciding? I think we should have, but we didn't. You think it should have been equal, but it wasn't. Yeah. I think it ends up being a lot of like, uh, uh, but then I did this. And how much of you done and like, you know, but I did a little bit more here and so on. Yeah. Ignoring that look, why are we doing this together? We're doing this together because we think we're going to create something amazing in front of us. And when we create that amazing thing in front of us, like 99% of the effort is in front of us. Not behind us. But we're focused on this one percent that we did already. We're haven't even done. We're like, you know, whatever you're looking at, how famous are you? Like, you know, they know you or you're like older or you have like, you know, or you put in a little bit more capital, but all that's going to matter is what do we do over the next 10 years together? So you know, it's complicated. You could, we obviously learn an example of a company that didn't do. We did it. He didn't do it equally. We sort of basically end up being a super weird, heuristical negotiation that people do. And you see founding teams like bombing out and not starting their endeavor or splitting off just because of these kind of conversations that they have. Okay. I've seen many, many, many, many people that are like, oh, you know, that's unacceptable. I can't believe that he's going to have 5% of them. You know, and then it doesn't work out. But usually those discussions of how much should you get, how much should I get, they end up being completely wrong because they're all going to be what we're going to do together next 5, 10 years. And that's unpredictable. We don't know what's going to happen. And I also think people waste time and it's, they end up on a bad footing together. Like, you know, it's like, I have bad feel. Okay, we'll do this together. But I'm really pissed off that you got like more than me, you know, so that's like, that's lingering always in the back of our head. And it's going to pop up when we get into conflict. It's like, oh, is this, are you saying that now because you have more shares than me? And so on. So I prefer not to have that, you know. Okay, so you have a fan of equality across. Yeah. Okay, it's just, you know how it's going to pan out. You don't know how things are going to evolve. Okay, fair enough. We had Huggy Rouse, a professor of business school is advocating for the opposite. All right. So, but I think different. Well, I mean, he's right in the sense that Databricks did it the way he said. And you guys, we were, we haven't, we still around. So. Okay. And it wasn't earned equity based on performance. It was just pre-negotiated different amounts. Yeah. It's up being a super ad hoc. That's right. Okay. Based on the past, which is not indicative of how things are going to pan out in the future. I promise you. We'll move forward. I know there's so many topics to cover. And Geng, I will give you guys a chance also for questions to start thinking about them. And we'll start to have the team teed up in about 20 minutes to solicit audience questions. But we are at Stanford. You guys are an amazing poster child for an academic who become, as you sort of pointed out the very beginning, Ben Horowitz, that it was the worst pitch he's ever seen. Now you're the best CEO, according to him in, in, in recent portfolio. So I want you to share if you can accelerate the development of all of our aspiring academics turned entrepreneurs. Can you share pitfalls that they should avoid that could, that would have accelerated your development if you had learned those earlier? Yeah. I mean, first of all, when you start a technical company, you focused a lot on like, all that matters is to people that knows the technical thing that you're inventing in the product market fit. And I think that was a mistake. I remember at some point we were hiring an office manager just in the office and we're like, well, here she better know how to program, right? I'm like, well, maybe they don't need to know programming. I mean, that it really does office manager really need to know, well, they should at least know HTML, which was one of the co funders. So yeah, and then everybody's like, yeah, definitely HTML. You know, I think that's, over time you learn that, hey, there's so many other skills that are so important. There's so much else that you're going to need in the company. So we started super insular like that of like, what all the matters is the technical acumen on this particular thing. And this is again, why it goes back to like, I think those like when you split the equities, you're just going to be focused on this narrow thing. You don't see how things will evolve in the future. You have to broaden your perspectives. I think having team members that have other backgrounds, and by this, I mean, usually when you say founding teams, it's a founding team, they're all are exactly looking to say the same. They look the same. They have the same gender or they have the same ethnicity, but they're all like PhDs and computer science in the same narrow field even. You know, and they're publishing the same papers or they have like the same or sometimes you meet business people and they're like all McKinsey people together starting a company and they're like, oh, we're looking for some people that know how to do programming. And so if you can have a little bit of, so you can have more well-founded team. So it's not just trust on the founding team, it's also diversity. If you can't get diversity, so you can cover more, so that you're not, you're kind of redundant, you know, like you're like, there's five of you, but you're actually the same people. And you trust each other so much, you're literally just one person, just splitting the five bodies. And yeah, so I think if you can, but again, it's hard to find people that you trust, but if you can get people that understand the business aspects, that know how to do partnerships, that understand go-to-market, that understand product management, and so on, that's going to be super, super important. And those are going to be some of your most important hires in the next six months or 12 months of your company, it's going to determine the outcome in the future for your company. And I just want to make sure that people get this point because I think oftentimes in academia, it's rewarded for actually understanding everything. And is it true or was your experience that that was an asset or a liability when you were foreign to these other areas outside of your areas of expertise? It's an asset and it's a liability. It depends on how you use it. It often is a liability. I see a lot of the, I have a lot of folks that I've seen that come from academia that fail. And then obviously it's a liability. The reason they fail is that, especially if you've done research and so on, you're very detailed oriented, you have a certain deductive mindset. You come from this background where you reason through everything and you work with these people that are super smart. So you expect everybody around you to be that way. So then when you hire someone in marketing, you apply the same kind of judgment on them and you question what they're doing and they're like, oh, we're going to do a campaign that looks like this. And then you apply exactly the bar you would apply in academia. Like, okay, walk me through from first principles, why you're thinking through this. And they're not, they're not, they usually don't have the backgrounds we have. They don't think like us, they don't speak like us. And we're like, okay, this doesn't even hold water. This person is, why, what are you even doing here? Like no, I'm an absolute no. By the way, I'm going to micromanage and do it right myself. So now I'm suddenly a marketing expert here in five minutes and I'm going to, I think we should do it this way. That's the, that's the failure mode of academics. And then what's the right mode? This is so good. What does the right mode look like? Actually, what's the counterintuitive but correcting to do? Yeah, I mean, they speak a different language than you. Yeah. They're not going to come at it from deductive reasoning first. I mean, maybe you find someone that's just like you and you find the perfect marketer and salesperson and corp dev and so on and okay, but usually they come from a different background. The people that do sales are a little bit different from the people that are engineering. The people that be marketing are a little bit different. So, so I think you should kind of turn off that part of your brain. You should value experience because it matters. You know, these fields have been built over the last 40, 50 years in business and you know, they know how to do sales. There is art to doing marketing. There's art to doing product management. There is art to do that. So just because they don't like speak and look and can articulate it the way you would like to, you shouldn't just dismiss them. So actually as a founder, I kind of like, I kind of turned off and sometimes I would go and talk to my co-founders and they're like, oh my god, like, how do you, how can you even stand this person? And I'd like, I give them a chance, you know, I agree with you that they didn't add up. And yes, that part of the argument didn't make sense. And yeah, it's like they're a little bit funny like that. But maybe they're right. You know, maybe they're right about how they're doing it. And that way you can kind of broaden the diversity of talent in your company. So that's the way to do it right. You know, and the way to fail is to just look to hire all people that look exactly like you, not physically or gender wise or ethnicity, but you know, they're wired like, they have the same background when you look at the CV. It's like the same CV as you. Yeah. So I want to move into moments that the inflection moments in Databricks story. So moments that unlocked phase shifts and growth. And I want to start by talking about how Databricks growth accelerated. Because after starting the company, it didn't happen right away. Yeah. So can you talk to us through that? What was the catalyst for product, market, fit and growth? And if you can package any timeless lessons for the aspiring founders that you learned, it's welcomed. Yeah. But what we went through might not apply to every startup or two years startup. But we were based, we had an open source project, Apache Spark. The Apache Spark did not have, it was not the market leader. It didn't have. There was something called the DUPAC then, which you don't even remember probably, hopefully, that had, that was like, nobody got fired for using that, not our thing. So stage one of the company was, how do we beat that thing? And it just, it was very, very hard. So this was really mostly a marketing and an open source fight that we fought from 2009, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, suddenly something shifted in the market. And suddenly we became the hottest thing in the market. It's like the coolest thing ever. And everybody wanted to embrace our own product. Six years ago. Six years. Six years, guys. It's much understandable. Yeah. It was a long time. And many of people like after that, they knew us with Spark and they're like, oh, you obviously had this very successful thing. No, we like, it sucked for six years. And you know, you really need, so I think marketing is really, really important. I think we underestimate marketing, especially technical people with my background underestimated. But something happened in 2014. In particular, there's a lot of fun in the market, like these vendors that were hearing about our open source project, they were sort of saying, hey, oh, yeah, I heard of these virtually guys and Spark. It's only good if you have a lot of memory in your machines. For that very narrow use case, it works well. If you don't have enough memory, the whole thing this falls apart. And it was not true. And we kept telling people, but it just every reporter, every article kept repeating this, every conference kept going, we were like, where is this fun coming from this fear uncertainty and doubt that was being sold by existing vendors? Or you can use Spark for machine learning and AI, which at the time was not hot. So it was bad. And it was like, you can use them for AI machine learning, but you can't use them for anything else. And we were like, oh, my God, if we were going to be in that tiny narrow market, we're dead, right? So what happened is basically in 2014, me and my co-founders, we were up whole week and we got a bunch of machines. These machines had less than a petabyte of memory and aggregate, but we sorted a data set that was more than a petabyte, which means we proved that we can process a lot of data without having enough memory. So we basically dispelling this myth that you need enough memory to use our product. And we set the world record in sorting a petabyte on machines at the time, sorted the petabyte in 22 minutes or something. And it was the world record. Alibaba had the world record before us, I think, at 60 minutes or 70 minutes. And for some reason, we worked with reporters and the reporters really picked this up. And they really like one viral. And that kind of like dispelled the main myth. And I think that was like an inflection point where suddenly all of our competitors that hated us. And so on Sunday said, oh, we love Spark. Spark is the greatest thing since Apple Pie. Like every day we would see articles popping up. In the beginning, you have one article talking about your company. You're super excited. In a year, you have one article you're like, amazing. Now we're getting like, you know, article a week. You know, an article almost every day. Oh, four or five articles per day. It was unreal. We're like, oh my god, this thing is like on viral. It was like the most amazing thing. So this was 2014-15. And our vision was, at that point, we were like, okay, we're going to be product-less growth. We have this viral open source thing. So PLG and the product, we just sell itself, right? Make slick websites. You slide credit card. We don't need to hire salespeople. We don't like salespeople. We don't want to hire salespeople. We only want people like ourselves, right? So we don't like those guys. And that was kind of the thinking and it'll be awesome. And revenue just was like super, super slow. It just wasn't growing. And then 2015, we're like, we need to double down on this. We call it zero touch. No more salespeople. No more talking to customers. Let's just make the experience so awesome. This thing goes viral and people buy our product. And when we double down on this PLG product-led growth, revenue just stagnated completely. So it was like two quarters, Q2 and Q3 of 2015. It was literally like a flat line. It was like, oh my god, like nothing is happening. So there was like crisis moment. We ended that year at one and a half million revenue. And it was sort of like, yeah, basically most of us, at least me, let me speak for myself. I was kind of like, hey, we're great academics. We had great success with open source. But this business thing is not for us. And we just don't know how to make money. We're not got business. Business people have business sense and they do this MBAs and all this kind of, we don't have that. And this is how much cash do you have in the bank? I mean, months of cash, are you going low? And we probably have quite a bit, but we've hired so many people. We are valued, I think, 50 to 50. I think that would have a billion or maybe 250 million. That's a huge valuation. For a million of revenue. Yeah, for a million of revenue. So the multiple is very rich even by today. It's crazy standards. And we keep pointing all the investors to downloads. I can have so many downloads on our open source project. There's like a million downloads here. And they're like, stop showing us the download charts. We need to see revenue. So that's kind of like, I would say the second inflection point happened that year, where we kind of went through multiple pivots. And what was the unlock there? Because just everybody, right now, I don't know what the numbers are, but it's over a billion in revenue. We were like eight years later from that point, right? And so you went from a million to a billion, you've grown 1,000 X. What was the unlock? Because product-led growth is still sort of the gospel from above that a lot of entrepreneurs swear by. So if PLG wasn't giving you the dividends that you needed, what changed? Was it sales? Yep, just higher sales team. Yeah, first of all, I'll say I'm not a big fan of PLG personally. It's very few people can crack the code on PLG. If you do, kudos to you. It's kind of like if your kid comes and says to you, hey, I want to be like NBA will champion when I grow up. That's going to be my career. It's like, ah, very few people, like, you're distal. You're probably not going to get there. So we really did two things, two kind of pivots. Pivot number one was we doubled down on enterprise sales. So like the opposite of PLG. Get sales people, every salesperson needs to sell it. You need to hire a lot of salespeople. So very people that we said we don't like, go higher like the most enterprise sales type of those people. So that's pivot number one with it. Pivot number two with it is that we can't, it turned out that we were open sourcing technology. But people didn't want to, you know, they could just get that open sourcing technology from Amazon. They could get it from the other cloud vendors. Those guys had much bigger distribution channel. Why would you come to Databricks? Add this funny joke. I think we were in a restaurant in Amber India in SF and having Indian food. And it was like, a bunch of people came up to us and go, are you guys spark guys? Like, yeah, what is spark guys? Like, can we get a selfie with you? And we're like, oh, yeah, of course. Yeah, I can feel like I'm famous. And it took like selfies. And then the same people we met them the next day because they were also a customer and we're like, hey, can we like do this deal? Can you pay us $100,000? And like, why would I pay you $100,000? Same person who took selfie like the day before. And like, well, because our software is awesome. It's like, yeah, but I don't want to pay you $100,000 for that. I can get that for free almost on Amazon. Why should I pay you that? So then it was like, that's when we started realizing, okay. So yeah, it's cool that we open sourced this thing and you can download it for free. You're not going to pay us a dime. Are you? And then pivot number two was how do you figure out a way to make money on open source, which anyone can download for free. And people that are much bigger than you are going to offer it for free. So those were two pivots that we had to really nail over the next, took almost two years to nail the next two ones. And can you give us the quick cliff notes and search number two? How do you monetize open source? Yeah, so open source is very, very hard to monetize. I don't recommend that either. Just like PLG. If you're going to start an open source company. How many are interested in doing an open source company here? No one. One? Another two. Three. Raise your hand. Open source. How many people are even starting an open source company? Raise your hand. It's be proud. Yes. You're making the world a better place. Right? And hopefully make your money. The problem with open source is that the perfect formula for succeeding with open source looks as follows. It requires two home runs that happen consecutively. And each home run is kind of a product market fit 10x value, what Peter Tiel calls 0 to 1, 10x value, right? So home run number one, you better have an open source project that goes viral in the whole world, downloads and adopts. If you can't do that, then it was a real big mistake for you to start an open source company because you've given away your IP and you've given away your IP to anyone who would like to beat you and compete with you. And you got nothing back for it. What is downloading it? No one cares about it. So that was a big mistake. So you better have your first home run. Of course, business entrepreneurship comes with risks. You should take those risks and if you fail, you can try again. But let's say you succeed. And now this thing is going kind of viral. Lots of people are downloading it. Lots of people are using it. That's stage number one. Stage number two, you need another 10x value, just like Peter Tiel says, you need 10x to really change the market. You need another 10x on top of it. And you layer that on top of the existing one, that one you keep proprietary and that one they have to pay you. And it's very hard to do one home run, let alone two home runs consecutively, using one for open source, using the second one for proprietary value and selling. If you succeed doing both, you have an amazing formula and you're going to crush everybody. Because you're going to get the amount of marketing you're going to get out of the first home run and the worldwide sort of is unprecedented. It's almost, you know, it's right. Because it's free and the whole world will know about you. And then with home run number two, you use that demand that came in and you converted it into revenue and it's amazing. But it's hard. So what's the takeaway? Because the fastest growing companies on the enterprise space that have monetized are all open source. Are they? Yeah, I think the top three of, at least the top four. I can get the data. That's the right answer. But yeah, yeah, I think it was like, I think we are the largest company that per developer is open sourcing. And the lines of lines open sourced per developer, like Google has more engineers than I have more open source projects. But if you look at, if you normalize for a number of engineers, I don't think anyone is open sourcing more than we are per engineer. So I think we would be the largest kind of successful one right now before us. It was red hat. I think open source is hard. Okay. I'm saying it's hard. If you can pull it off, it's awesome. But you better think about both of those two acts. So what was your? Oh, sorry. Yeah. Think about both acts and nail both of them is try to think it through. The way we did it was not optimal. We were Berkeley hippies and we just gave it all away. And we didn't think about the second act. So when we had to think about the second act, we had to kind of like, oh my god, I can't believe we open sourced this part of it. That's so stupid. I wish we had not open sourced this portion. So try to think that through in advance. And so you actually go through two zero to ones. Is that is that is that what you're saying? So you did zero to one with the, which was a 10x improvement with Spark. And then you did another zero to one with, with, with close. Let me explain it. Yeah. Yeah. So what was we built this engine that was leveraging modern hardware, parallel instructions, blah, blah, blah. And we wrote really low level code. And we basically made Spark 10x faster. So you can just, if you're using Spark open source, we have an engine that you can plug in. It'll be completely compatible to whatever, if you're using Spark, it just works with what you have. It just like is a turbo pack that makes it 10x faster. Okay. And 10x faster in like when you're processing big amounts of data, that means you can use 10x less machines. Meaning 10x less machines means you get a 10x improvement in price. So then we split the difference with you. And we say, hey, pay us a little bit for that. And you get some savings on the infrastructure. And it's 100% compatible with Spark. And most people initially, their reactions, like, wait a minute, I thought you guys are to awesome open source people. You're telling me like there is like this other proprietary thing, like, well, do you want it or not? And that I call is it really 10x faster or not? And we're like, okay, let's do an evil. And then they're like, okay, fine. It's a thanks. So let's split the difference. Okay. So the source is not the path to go. No, I think it's, I mean, look, it's nuanced. You're just saying you have to understand, you have to be sober. Yeah, I feel bad because I'm here like contradicting all the things we did. I'm like, oh, you know, split that query, but we didn't do it. You know, don't do open source, we were open source. But it's harder if, you know, it's, if you can do a company that does, I mean, like one of our competitors at the AWS is Snowflake is a company called Snowflake. It's completely proprietary. Everything was proprietary. And I think it's easier for them. But they didn't have to worry about which part do I open source, which part do I not open source, you know, all that kind of stuff. Okay. I could spend so much more time on this, but I know there's so much to recover. And I only have like five or 10 minutes. So gang, get your questions ready. But I want to go to another unlock now, which is scaling. Yeah. So now you're in the scaling phase. Yes. You have 8,000 employees. Yeah. So sorry, 7,000 employees. Yeah. I think this says 8,000 now. Okay. Former employees refused to remove the adabits from there because they love it so much. Yeah. But you guys are famous for having built a really amazing culture. When you talk about what the unlock was that you learned when you were scaling, that future founders should know, and that's a sort of open question. I guess it's a more specific. Well, there's like, how do you do scaling? Well, then there is like, how do you have awesome culture? Yeah. And then how do you have awesome culture when you're scaling, which is way harder because much easier when you're all together and you know each other. And then there's a done version number 150, right, about which everything gets harder and below which or ever. There's a phase shift that happens about 150 employees. And there's a, you know, below that things are different. Which one? Where do you want to? And then it decides to creating a great culture that nobody talks about. Okay. I have very controversial opinions here. I think when you start your company, the culture of your company is that more or less the personality of the CEO and that's it. Nothing else. Okay. And as a result of that, by extension of that, that means also recursively, like if you have a leader that runs this whole department, the culture of that department is that leader. And it's kind of recursive all the way down, right? So, and you know, just to prove that because that might seem really like controversial to people like, oh, I thought it's the culture principles or like I read about these like, you know, Netflix deck or something like that. But if you look at it, what I'm saying is that Bill Gates, Microsoft is a very different culture from Steve Balmer, Microsoft, which is a very different culture from Satyana Dela, Microsoft, right? So it's like literally the personality. And if you can get along with Satyana now and you operate the way he likes to operate, you're going to be successful with him. And if you operate probably the way you would do with Steve Balmer, it's not going to work great. And then it's turtles all the way down. So, and so my key thing is this, can you formalize that? So make culture principles out of that. Then you're giving people the cheat sheet of how they can succeed in your company. Okay. So, culture is just, can you write down what those are, those things that make the CEO? By the way, I believe at the Amazon, this is how they came up with their 11 and then out 13 leadership principles. I think initially they just wanted, Jeff Besson just wanted one, which is leaders are right. And then eventually they like studied how he does things and they kind of tried to replicate his personality and that became the leadership principles, I believe. But so if you codify them, you're giving the cheat sheet to the employees to know like, hey, here's, here's how it is working with me. So you're making their life easier. Okay. When you're codifying those principles, you can lie to yourself and pretend you're someone you're not. That's not going to go well. You're misleading the employees. So Ben Horvitz has a great book. I think I always screw up the title. I think it's, you are what you do or something like that, which means it's what you do. That's who you are, not what you say or what you think you should be. So write down properly what, who you really are. Interrespect that. Write down those as the controversial. Okay. Second, if after you've done that, make sure that you are promoting people and making them successful in the company if they follow the culture principles. Third, hire people according to the culture principles. Fort, manage people out according to culture principles. If you do these, you know, you will have a consistent culture. And these principles are your values because before there's also takeaway of diversity, you don't want everybody to look like you. Yeah. But you do want everybody to look like you along certain values. Yeah. You can't have a CEO that's super introverted and quiet and maybe passive aggressive, which might believe it or not, there are successful CEOs that have that personality trait that I know. And then you hire a sales leader that's like the polar opposite. They're not going to be able to work well together. So there's certain values you need to have in common to work. This is what all these business books call, is the person a culture fit or not. But I just want to make sure that the takeaways clear. So there's certain values that are sacred that are through lines for the whole organization. But then you want diversity for skills or. Yeah. I mean, let me tell you what the culture means about the director's, you get a sense. But really, they're like, we came from research, we're research personality, the seven, seven people that started a company. It's really those values that all of us kind of had. We work from first principles, we added that. Yes, I know earlier that we should broaden it. But it's still, if you look at the other bricks, it's going to be a company that largely works from first principles. We very picky about who we hire. So we have a culture principle called raise the bar, don't settle on hiring. Because we saw a lot of people coming, successful leaders coming from other companies. And we were completely constantly fighting each other. We couldn't get it along. We were like that person is no good. And back to them, they're amazing. And so that's a culture principle for us. We're truth seeking, which comes from the research background. We're very like, tell it as it is, be honest about it. We don't like, that's not common in the industry. A lot of execs in the industry, they like to present a nice executive presence, nice, rosy picture of how things are going. Those people don't work out that data bricks. But it's really like my personality and my co-founders personality that's good to codified. And so can we walk through how these principles might inform a hard decision? So I don't know if you want to talk about this or not. But I presume there's a lot of pressure on data bricks to go public. I don't know if that's true or not. And you know, stripe and other companies have had a lot of pressure to create liquidity for their employees to give their employees wealth. And so they've done this thing where they created a mechanism for the employees to get paid out. Is that something that you, is that an issue that you are thinking about? And if so, what questions are you wrestling with that maybe people don't think about or to make that decision? Yeah, look, it's, of course, employees want liquidity and you want to provide them opportunities to have liquidity. We have provided lots of those over the years. And we're going to keep continuing doing that. Being public, that's one of the main advantages. Is that your investors and your employees get liquidity. Some people would also argue that it makes you operate, provide certain rigor and certain accountability and so on. I think in the end of this case, we already have that in spades. I think we already operate like a public company, but what do I know? Maybe I'll change my view once the public. I think there's a downside in that market's force you be very sort of quarterly focused with earning reports every 90 days. And I think you want to run a successful company. And when you IPO for your first time, you want to be successful in your IPO. You don't want to just go out there and misnumbers and say, I don't care. I have a 10-year vision who cares. So the stock just tank to zero, right? And the employees are going to care. So I think it's going to affect how you make decisions. And I think being private lets you make asymmetric moves to win in the market. That being public doesn't let you. It just ties your arms. And we have very, very successfully, I think, used techniques like that, like price cuts, like acquisitions, like deploying lots of people in certain countries that other people are not going to deploy because the ROI right now is not high in that country when the markets are crashing and they need to drive our ROI. So it was just for us, it was a way to raise huge amounts of money. Our belief in 2021 was that there's going to be massive inflation in the future. But inflation was like not existing in 2021. Interest rates were zero. Our hypothesis was there's going to be a huge correction. Interest rates are going to go up. Grab as much money as you can humanly do. So I think we raised two and a half billion in that year. And then the idea was, let's not go public like everybody else is. And let's use this strategically. Well everybody else, we thought that there's going to be market correction. We knew couldn't nail the time. But and they didn't really happen. It's been like a, you know, software. It's unclear. And our idea was, let's, like when our competitors, like Snowflake and so on, let's asymmetrically invest where they can't invest and utilize the fact that we're private. And we did that. I think there will be public. I'm not going to give you exact date. But I think it served us well. You know. So many more questions I want to ask. But we're out of time. I want to ask one final question. I'm going to open it up, which is, are there any, you are this genius who's been able to move from academia to industry and become a phenomenal successful CEO? And you also have, you know, a childhood history of moving cultures, moving from Iran to Sweden, then to the United States. Are there any practices that can be shared to develop skills that you think are very valuable that you've, you realize now are really valuable for you as an entrepreneur? Yeah. I do think that this is what kind of always, I'll tell my wife, which is like, you know, if the kids go through rough times or change schools and so on, I think it's good for them. It sets them up for, it's, you know, so it's just they're just going to learn more. They're going to kind of get out of their shell. Each challenge they go through when they're having a hard time in school and so on. It's a challenged later in life, they might see something similar as well. So I think it's great. The advice I would give is just try to broaden and challenge yourself and work with people that you otherwise might not want to work with or you don't like or you think they're different and so on. Roder your perspectives because in running a company at like, you know, like Databricks today, I have to deal with salespeople that are super extroverted and super optimistic. Right? And, you know, if you have to like, if you have to generalize, there are of course many different types of salespeople, but they're like the kind of, if you have to generalize them and they're not all like this, they're like kind of the jocks from high school. Okay. And you have the engineers, more pessimistic, more conservative, more sort of risk averse, very detail oriented. You've got to work with them. If the marketing people who are more storytellers and more artistic, you know, and though they're very different, they're, you know, on emotional versus rational, left side of the brain, right side of the brain, all these people are very, very different. You need to be able to get the best out of all of them and each of these department end up being very important in your success. So you want to be able to work well with all these different people, get the best out of them and make them do something that puts your company ahead of the other companies out there. So challenge yourself to work with these different types of personalities. You see them already in your life's society. And is that a skill that you built? I mean, I can feel how multi-valent you are, how you can go on different levels just by talking to you. Is that, were you born with that or is that something that you actually have built by proactively doing these exercises? No, I think you learn. I think it's, I think you can learn a lot of this stuff. You know, dealing with people and so on. You know, it's, it's, you learn. I mean, you make mistakes also. You learn to do two mistakes. But I think the key thing I would say then maybe a, what, lasting I would say is as much as possible, try to put yourself in people's shoes and walk backwards from how they're thinking about things, how they're perceiving the things you're saying, how they're thinking about the world. If you always do that with your employees, how's the charter department going to understand this that I just said? How's the engineer is going to feel about this? How are my customers going to feel about this? If you can do that really, really well, you can get the best out of them. You can get them energized and you can get them to kind of sympathize with you. So the more you can do that, the better. And it's hard to do because we all like to see the world from our own lens, like just from my own personal perspective. I think everybody thinks exactly like me, but they don't. They're in a different spot and they see things differently. Awesome. Thank you. We're going to do questions, gang, raise your hands. We're very limited on time. So try to keep your questions succinct. Thank you. Amazing interview. My question, my question is, what's the biggest change that you, you have encountered for the company stage from 0 to 1 versus from 1 to 10? For both of them, we're just 0 to 1 only. Yeah, 0 to 1 versus 1 to 10. But like the biggest challenge from 1 to 10. I mean, look, 0 to 1 is just a constant challenge or product market fit. How do we build something that people want to use just once? And then how do we build something that they use it? Because you know, and then finally you crack the code and they're using it once, but then they throw it away. So when they're in front of you, they're like, oh, this is super cool. I love it. But then you go and you look at the numbers and they stop using it after one day. Why are they not using it again? So then you go and you try to get them to use it again and again and again. And that's the whole journey of understanding. And then it's really realize, okay, you built a vitamin. We all take the vitamin. We're excited when we buy it. But then the next day we forget to take the vitamin. And the next day we forget to take the vitamin. So you have a vitamin. You don't have a pain killer. That's necessary. Then once you crack the code on that, and you have the pain killer and they're taking it all the time when they have a headache, then the challenge is now you want to charge for it. And then how about to people like, oh, if you're going to, if I have to pay for this, then I don't want to have it at all. And like, what? You were using it every day. Yeah, yeah, it's not that valuable. So then you have to figure out how do I actually price it and how do we monetize it and how do we change the product to make it more valuable. Each where distinct product market fit before we had really revenue and things were working. Those were very, very challenging steps. You know, we had to really nail. But they didn't have anything to do with scaling. That one to end the challenge is scaling. And there the challenge is you can no longer also typically have a certain size. You're probably now beyond 150 employees. The game changes from, I understand everything everyone is doing. I have it all in my head. I was there from day one. I can micromanage everything. I know exactly what everybody should be working on. To like, okay, there's a big team of 100 people in Japan. The other but today has a big team in Japan. Many of them don't speak English actually at all. Right? There's a big team in Brazil. There's a team in India. There's a team in China. There's a team in Europe, Germany, France, blah, blah, you name it, right? So now it becomes like what are the processes? How do we scale this machine with processes that enforce our culture and things going right? Without me even knowing, I can't even talk to them. So there's a different challenge. And so it becomes much more process oriented and scaling and doing that in different markets. We also have their own culture. We talk about culture, but you know, database culture in Japan is probably a little bit different from the database culture in Italy. Awesome. Great answer. Next question. Thank you so much. I have a question. I read an article about the library talk about at the beginning, the goal is to sell the company for $100, $200 million. And now it's like much bigger. So I bet during the time you got multiple offers, but how do you make decision like, or whether I sell the company or not. And for yourself, how do you make decision on your own career? Why do you want to become a CEO or you want to start a new company? So that's my question. Yeah, I didn't want to start a company. And I was reluctant. I was at least in of the co-founders. But for selling or not, advice number one, don't tell your co-founders if you have an offer. Okay? Because there's going to be a lot of politics and they're going to have a lot of opinions. And you don't want to hear their opinions. It's really your decision. And the acquisition offer as a CEO and you have co-founders, don't tell them. Again, in this lecture, I'm just going to contradict everything I did and tell you to the opposite. I told my co-founders it's a terrible idea. Don't do that. They have a lot of opinions. Okay. Even if you trust them. You trust them. I trust them. I trust them. Literally, I was like, since I trust them and we have this tight-knit group and we're so, I have to tell them this. Okay. And I told them and then I didn't like what they were saying. Okay. So in my opinion, be very careful. Like if you end up not wanting to sell or if you're not selling, be very, very careful. Because what if they are like, no, no, no, no, you're destroying the company. This is our only chance to sell. You have to sell it now and you're like, no, I don't want it. That's a very tough spot to be in. Be very careful with that. So. How do co-founders have good-have fights in that situation? Is it just right to see the decision? It makes the decision. No, it siblings, right? And it is like, it's very hard. It's not. That's what I'm saying. Don't do it. Okay. It's going to be very hard. You're going to get me into trouble soon. I'm going to lose my co-founder. But so that's what I would say. You know, I think that most, I think a rational way of thinking about selling, there's many ways I'm not going to give you all the answers. But pretty rational way is to say, look at your growth rate and see how it's going. And if you just compound that for three years, where will you be in three years? You can do a best case, medium case, poor case scenario. And the acquisition offer better definitely be the worst case scenario, right? Probably also the middle case scenario as well. Then you can decide what you want to do with your life. You want to do another one or not. But so this is the last time for people who want to buy companies that I think most people who buy companies don't understand this. The founder is not going to sell it for the value it has today. They can just sit on their butts for one year and the growth rate will be this much and with this multiple will be this much. So you have to pay a significant premium. There are two types of acquisitions. There are in my opinion. There are acquisitions of companies that are kind of, it's not really working. And there are acquisitions of companies that are doing well. But I'm talking about these companies that are doing well. It's going well, it's growing. And there are companies that you have to close doors and it is over. You have to, then, you know, that's a different equation. And you only have this much time and you have to find the best offer. We have time for one more quick question. I think he had his hand up first. So from fairness perspective area. Yes. Thank you so much for coming by. I really resonated with what you said at the start of the talk about having a large team because I also worked in a venture recently. That's split up because we had concerns about too many founders and also overlapped in fields of interest. And so I'm wondering for you, when you founded the team, how do you go about protecting your position, given the existing overlapping, like, expertise of your co-founders, now you protected it when you brought it in additional folks with potentially more expertise. Specialized expertise. This is a great question. It's a great question. We have 40 seconds. Okay. The second answer is everybody has to have, you have to agree with your co-founders from day one that you have to have the best interest of the company in mind. And if everybody agrees on that, everybody pays lip service to that, then you have to make that reality. And that's going to be very hard because what's best for me doesn't necessarily match what's best for the company. But if you want to succeed in your venture, you have to make sure that that's the guiding principles. And then the difficult decisions will have to be made from there, which some people are going to be unhappy. And it's hard to hire people when you have so many co-founders and give them leadership responsibilities and feel like they have control when you have seven co-founders. As I said, we have to do what's best for the company. Okay. So if we have to do what's best for the company, then if the new person is above you or below, if you're a co-founder of mine, if I layer you, if that's the best thing for the company, you and I have to agree now that that's the right thing. You might not like that. That's it. And you might want to quit, but we agree that from the beginning that we were going to do the best thing. And that also applies to me. Maybe I'm not the best CEO. We should also that we should just at all times do the best thing. We don't have time for any other thing. It's hard enough as it is. And on that mission-driven principle, let's give Ali a round of applause for sharing. So, don't miss me. Thank you, Ali, for sharing your experience and insights.
