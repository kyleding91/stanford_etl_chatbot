 You are listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. There's so much talk about green tech, clean tech, and energy tech right now. We've had so many speakers in here talk about that not only this quarter but in past quarters. There's an extraordinary opportunity right today to meet somebody who's actually been doing this. You know, getting their hands dirty if you will by building a plant and putting it into production. And as well as the person who funded them. The other thing that's kind of interesting about today is that we never tire of having entrepreneurs and their investors here together. I mean most of the time we have an entrepreneur whether they're still running a startup or maybe their startup has come very, very big. And they're here alone like Cheryl last week from Facebook or Mary Baker the week before from play first. Or we have the venture capitalists here. And they're here and so they talk about how they feel about entrepreneurs. But every once in a while we've had somebody practicing this at the same time. And I recall we had Mark Zuckerberg here with his venture capitalists when he first started Facebook, Jim Breyer. And that was a very interesting session. And so this is how many happened about once a year. So it's something we like to do. And so pleased that you came to join us today. So why don't we start off with saying when I start with you Steve. Tell us a little bit about yourself rather than me getting the highlights of your bio. Tell me a little bit about your career and how we got here today. Sure. Well, thank you all for attending today. I'm really pleased to be here. As Tom mentioned I'm Steve Paracone CEO and co-founder of BioFuelBox. Prior to that I had been involved with three other startups with varying degrees of success. So successful IPO beyond my imagination. Another acquisition which fell below my level of expectation and then a flame out. So I think I've experienced all those things and those sets of experiences certainly have helped us as we move forward with BioFuelBox. My first startup was company called Network Teller Systems which sold TCPIP, Code Remote Access software back in the dark ages of the late 90s. And we emptied it to people like Cisco Systems and Citibank and others like Netscape when they started. Our founder was Dr. John Davidson. I thought boy I could really learn from a guy who had co-founded Ungerman Bass. He was a technical founder of Ungerman Bass which was a high-flying local area networking company back in the day. And we grew that company for four years. I was a senior exec there. I was VP of Worldwide Sales. I grew it to about 45 people, about $15 million in revenue. A large networking company came to acquire us who showed me nameless for about $100 million. And I learned the hard way that when you work for somebody who has no exit strategy or no interest in giving up control, that many times it's difficult to have an exit. So we turned that offer down, make a long story short. I looked for my next opportunity and I thought gee this time around I'm going to go to a VC funded startup because that means there's an exit strategy in place. And I went to a company called Structured Internetworks where around Worldwide Sales and was InterMCEO and learned the hard way that time around that there are good VCs and bad VCs. And we happened to have bad VCs meaning that we had a dysfunctional board. I'll get to that. The dysfunctional board really was not interested in aligned with the company or our chart. They were strictly in it for the money. And it was just a bad experience. So the third startup, Sonic Wall, was really a restart of a company that had been failing because their core business was dying on Nick Ethernet cards. And we came in myself and Cisco's first marketing guy as a team to really help convert that company from a land networking card company into the world's first network appliance company, network security appliance. So when networking gear or security devices were a $100,000 Unix machines that took an army of IT guys, we came out with the first box that cost $500. It was a size of a videocassette. Got laughed at at the first trade show because all the smart people in the industry said it could never work. Well, 10 years later it's still a profitable company. We grew it to 200. Well, 450 people, $200 million Niagara revenue in a short period of time, profitability, and then an IPO. Which was where I learned that the good VCs can really help you because we allowed a VC to invest when it was time to come up with an exit strategy. They built a very strong board. And instead of selling the company, which was our management team's plan for a relatively small amount of money, we ended up IPO-ing and having a high market cap of $3.5 billion. What I'm most proud of is 10 years later it's still a profitable company. After taking a short time off, co-founded Biofuel Box about 3.5 years ago with a couple of my co-founders, not co-founders, colleagues from previous startups who really are avid and environmentalists. We saw an opportunity to start a company and an exciting new industry, not just drive a company for a bit drive an industry forward by applying our experience and entrepreneurial spirit to do some good. Great. I want to talk about Biofuel Box more in a minute, but let's talk about your life real quickly. Gosh. So I actually attended Georgetown University which took a degree in the School of Foreign Service. So I had foreign policy deep in my gene set. And most of my classmates went off and joined the Foreign Service. And I wanted to go out and try and make a difference in the world and looked at a bunch of different programs including the Peace Corps. And thought I wasn't quite up for building Latreans, I wasn't sure that that would have sort of the leverage effects that I think Cheryl talked about a little bit last year, last week. And, but I joined program where I went out to teach and teach young folks out in the bush out in Kenya. And that was really the roots of where I came at is really at the grassroots level trying to help folks in that case out in Sub-Sahara Africa. And came back and then started to get my business education through a Baining Company and other sources. And I really have been doing venture capital now for about 12 years to join DFJ back in 1997. And I came to DFJ through something called the Kauffman Fellowship Program which was a program to help bring folks who may not have a traditional background into the venture community. And it really was a great opportunity for me to learn quite a bit about the venture capital. It's still going on today. So a program today. It's still going to be a Kauffman Fellowship Program, right? That's right. So it is a program that you could also look into in your future particularly for those with graduate degrees you need a graduate degree to apply the program. And it really was a great opportunity for me to build a platform for learning how to be an effective venture capitalist, an effective investor and really help build companies from the very beginning. But my interest in my focus has been to be doing early stage investing. It was really inspired. I took a year off of my career to work on a political campaign and the gentleman that was running for office was a venture capitalist. And on the trail he would talk a lot about stocking the first shelves at Staples and the excitement and the passion of the entrepreneur and how they thought about trying to build their business from the ground up. And I was really inspired by this story. I thought well that seems like a noble task and that was the inspiration for jumping into the business. And here I am 12 years later still trying to identify great entrepreneurs and help them at the ground swell beginning. So just to make it clear here, DFJ is an investor in biofuel box. Is it the only investor so people can sort of understand that kind of? I'm a partner, she's a DFJ affiliate, is also a co-investor along with DFJ. And when did that take place? When did you, was that official a couple of years ago? 2007, October 2007. Okay, so we've been investor for two then. She's on the board as well. So just people understand the context here. So why don't we talk about biofuel box? What does that mean and what is it? So biofuel box was founded with really two missions in mind. One, to eliminate waste streams. And two, convert it to localized energy. Again, founded by Avid environmentalists, we were really focused on solving environmental problems, not just making money. But when we took a look at the broad range of things we could do within clean tech, it became clear that producing biofuels locally in a box or appliance made the most sense, particularly when we identified billions and billions and billions, over 10 billion gallons worth of waste material in wastewater treatment streams that could be converted into fuel. Went with biodiesel, which we produced with our system, because biodiesel doesn't require consumer behavioral change. So when we took a look at what was happening three and a half years ago, in the first way of the biofuels companies, they were all focused on converting food materials like soybean oil or corn and death and all. We just didn't see that scaling and we didn't see it scaling for a number of reasons, primarily because there was commodity market risk on the inputs and on the outputs. And there was a potential to get squeezed, which it's proven to be true. But in our case, what we did is we really just applied basic entrepreneurial and business sort of what we view common sense to the problem. Where is the biggest cost in the price of a gallon of fuel? It's the feed stock or the raw material. If you can solve waste problems, can you lock up that raw material for free? Yes, you can. If you can get that for free, can you be the low cost producer of fuel? Yes, sure. Well, that's one of the reasons why the people who care about the environment are upset with the first generation biofuels companies as well, right? Because it could have been rainforest in order to grow. In the driving up food prices. And so we're considered really a second use feed stock. Whereas the fat soils and greases that we convert into biodiesel really have no other use, they're being land-filled or incinerated or otherwise disposed of today. So are you into fuel business or in the waste remediation or what it would you call? If you ourselves really as a wastewater treatment or remediation company with biofuel or biodiesel as a revenue generating byproduct that we use not only to continue to drive the company forward and give great returns to investors, but also to incent those that have those waste streams through a profit share to give us those waste streams for 10 years. So what attracted DFJ to invest in these folks originally? So DFJ was a very early investor in clean energy and we think about clean energy as scarce resources. And so we've looked at a whole host of different areas where we're trying to identify how to better extend scarce resources and solve some of those problems fundamentally. One of the exciting things that we thought about biofuel box was really fundamentally about that feed stock and the opportunity to take advantage of eliminating waste on a fully distributed localized basis. So waste is expensive to get rid of. It's messy and it's fundamentally local. It's distributed all over the United States and it's a local business and folks have to figure out hairy ways of trying to get rid of it. And so it was exciting to be able to take what is fundamentally a waste product and a problem and solve it by turning it into a, in this case, scarce resource, which is a fuel solution. And we had looked at a lot of those first generation solutions sets like ethanol and passed on that because it didn't seem to exacerbate the fundamental challenge of scarce resource and scarcity versus trying to identify how to solve those problems and diversify our energy inputs. So that was a driver. You're great. Just like to add one thing to what Jennifer touched on localized energy production, which I alluded to in the beginning, we've not built large centralized plants. What we've done is we've created a biofuel box. It's actually a set of boxes now that are co-located at the waste stream. The co-located industrial food locations where they have fat soils and greases coming through the waste water stream or municipalities. So we localize an energy production and as part of doing that, not only do we lower the cost but we also eliminate transportation issues associated with putting carbon into the air to move liquids around. So do you have one installed anywhere now? We have our first fully scaled plant nearly installed up in Idaho, taking fat soils and greases from a potato food processing plant and converting it into biodiesel. French fried potatoes? French fries, hash brownies. I remember that in college. And it's contaminated with things like sand because it's the grease that hit the waste water stream. So it's not a real grease. So it takes that, goes in this collection of boxes and outcomes diesel that just run sand. So it's a pure biodiesel. And when that gets up to full production, that set of boxes, that plant, if you will, how much diesel will that produce? Millions of years per set of boxes. So we could scale it up by adding an additional set of the waste streams. I got it. So but I want to pause on a really critical point that Steve pointed out about this, which is this is a local taking local waste and turning it into diesel or biofuel at a local level. And one of the things many folks don't appreciate about the fuel business is that when you see prices of barrel of oil going up and down and it's fundamentally a commodity, when you think about it and how they trade futures and all the stuff that they're right about in the New York Times. But the challenge is that when you are talking about trying to deliver fuel to distributed regional locations, Idaho, Colorado, New Mexico, there's expensive transportation to bring them from a cheap port like Oakland or LA and getting that into those communities. And so actually the most expensive gas to deliver is often in some of the more remote and distributed areas of the United States or other parts of the world. And so when you talk about what by a fuel box is trying to accomplish, whether they're taking a local waste stream and eliminating that and then providing the fuel at that local you're actually eliminating two problems, which is that challenge of bringing in an expensive commodity into that region but also eliminating that local source. And the cost effectiveness of that is also the nice little benefit that comes as a result. Right. And how do you make money? So what's the business model? Selling fuel. Selling fuel. We're owners and operators in these plants. One of the other things we recognize was that the producers of this waste material, they didn't want to become a biodiesel company. They didn't want to have to change. It's not their core business. So the potato processor didn't want to become a fuel company. So instead we just make it easy to say yes. We cover all the capital costs. We staff it. We run it. We sell the fuel and we simply profit share back. So what's been the biggest challenges so far, the some of them for the company, just in general? I would say in this environment, the macro economy and the conditions that are happening there. Because we're owners and operators of these plants, you know, bringing in the capital that would normally be very straightforward to bring in is more challenging today than it would have been a year ago. And then the technology itself, how's that going? It's got extremely well. We've proven the technology works by taking this waste material that's high in contaminant, high in water, high in contaminants like sulfur, high in water, high in sand and grit and converted it into ASTM quality, which is the industry standard quality fuel. Yeah. So, but the, what about this, all I hear about the bio fuel industry that it's just deteriorated as a, as, and it's not attractive all and that is that all based on this bringing everything to a centralized refinery using commodity feedstocks and then getting hurt when the price of oil goes down. Is that why I think that's able or so down. It's a main reason. It's not the only reason. I think that biofuels in general certainly have taken a hit in the investment community and sort of in the median general because they did take that approach of converting pure oils in or food materials into fuel because that was a low hanging fruit. They had old technology that was 30 years old and to get to the market quickly, the easiest way to do it was to apply big dollars, build big plants and process food. Another mistake I think they made was they depended too much on consumer behavioral chains to drive their business. So an ethanol requires a flex fuel vehicle. I don't know how many of you are going to rush out and sell your car so that you can run ethanol, but not most people really can. So bio diesel made sense for that reason, especially in the industrial areas, but I think that also slowed the adoption rate of the fuels that were available. Well, I want to ask Jennifer about sort of DFJ's philosophy about clean tech investing in general, but maybe one more question for you is, so the founders were primarily information technology veterans, but this is a clean tech company. So how did you make the transition or deal with that? Because my goodness, I mean, there's a lot to know about the fuel business. There's a lot to know about the chemistry of the waste business. I mean, that's how you help me dealt with that to be a world-class startup. So as I mentioned, this is my fourth startup, Patricia Bright, who's one of my co-founders. This is her fifth startup, and she's had a winning experience at everyone, which is unique to itself. And John Zammick, it's his fifth startup, he was our other co-founder. We really had a collective set of entrepreneurial skills and experience, and it really just applied it to the space. And I think one of the things that we knew from experience is really identify the model that works, build a business around it, and then recruit in the pieces of technology that you need. So if we were back in the IT space, we'd be looking for software and hardware engineers in this space, we searched for those chemists that had experience with biofuels, and then those chemical process engineers that once we had a research team develop the core technology, we could then scale it. So we brought in a team of people from Chlorox, that Mark Pervator, VP of Engineering, had been at Chlorox for 20 years, as the guy driving those types of projects. So I think a big part of it is applying the experience you've learned to build a strong team and understand the areas that you continue. And look for the domain expertise. Like, did you get anybody in the fuel business? And we did. In fact, from the fuel business, I should say. Recently, we actually brought in a VP who came from BP, North America, who was driving our fuel sale strategy on the back end. So we didn't need that skill set until recently, we were about ready to produce fuel. But we, rather than try and learn a skill set and build a roll of decks in that area, we went and recruited an expert. Well, why don't we enlarge this a little bit and use the GFJ's view of the world? You guys still bullish about clean tech investing? Yeah, so. Even after what has happened in the macro economy? Well, you know, as I mentioned earlier, we are early stage investors. And we do focus on opportunities that are at the early stage, which tend to have a little bit more, a little less volatility about what's happening in macroeconomic conditions. In addition, our network itself is actually spread across the world. So we are looking at energy opportunities and clean energy opportunities here in the United States, but also in India and China, Israel, Russia, Europe and other areas as well. We have funding Vietnam and Korea. So we are very broadly based. And we are not the only country in the world that is trying to identify how to achieve energy independence and or reduce their respective countries' dependency on fuel and fossil fuels in particular, but also other scarce resources like water as well and how to expand food challenges when you have land scarce resources. So we look at the challenge quite broadly and we are looking at opportunities across the globe. And we are seeing an incredibly strong surge of interest on the entrepreneurial level. And that is fostered by universities like Stanford and other parts of the world. And some really exciting discoveries around materials, new materials, genetics, genomics has been a very important factor and will continue to be an important factor. And a lot of the discoveries that we will see, particularly for remediation with bacteria and solving some of the water problems and even food problems that we may say as well. So we see some clusters of effects that there is also a strong political will that is really unprecedented both with the administration that we see today, but also in administrations across the globe, China has made a huge commitment to trying to identify alternative sources. And the reason they are doing it isn't just out of the kindness of their hearts, but recognizing that there is a fundamental national security risk that has emerged that is now no longer an acceptable risk for these nation states. And that is really a fundamental difference that we think will continue to be an important factor here. And you are going to see issues around the commodity and commoditization of fuels when you look at oil. That is its supply and demand challenge that will continue. It is not going to go away. You are going to continue to have oil be a factor. But the interest here is to try and diversify our sources of energy and to diversify away from the existing solution sets. And so that there are better choices to match up to a given solution. Does oil have to be expensive for your ventures such as biofuel box to succeed? Right. So that is where the diversification of how we define clean energy is a scarce resource problem. In the case of biofuel box in particular, one of the attractive aspects of the economics model is the capacity to be profitable down at $30 a barrel, which we think fundamentally is where, if you are playing directly versus an oil play, you need to be thinking about you are building your business model without government stimulus and government credits where you can build a sustainable model that lives within the volatility of that framework. But there are other opportunities as well, renewables that were investing at other spaces in trying to build utility capacity around solar, for example, or in wind, which is another area that we have invested in. Where, in the case of solar, for example, we have one company that has $7 billion backlog of book do orders. Which one is that? It is called Bright Source. It was actually founded originally. I was company out of Israel and took advantage of that remote location and the sun to build out their control systems for capturing energy and just converting it into steam. They have $7 billion backlog with companies like PG&E and others around the globe. And you are also investors in Tesla, I think. We have made investments through our sales and through our partners and through electric car companies going both at the very high end with companies like Tesla, which is a local company that many of you know, which is fundamentally changing how we think about electric cars and the economics around electric cars. It is also changing when we think about dealership and distribution of cars, which was one of the very interesting aspects of that business model. And then we went after a loan with a company called Revvo, which is actually based in India, like in Bill of Cars, it reduced the number of parts in a car so that you can build a car much less expensive without the significant years of retooling if they ship all over the world, particularly in Europe. So there is a lot of different ways to skin the car. Well that is the excitement about it is there is just so many different opportunities that if you let me I can go on on that. Yeah, well Tim, you know, and we had Tim Draper your partner in the TL last quarter and he alluded to it as well that this was a great time to be a clean or green tech entrepreneur. So you feel the same way? I think it is, you are looking at some fundamental shifts. There has not been a fundamental change in the underlying technology for fuel in 50 to 100 years depending upon which segment you are looking at. And so some of the fundamental shifts around materials and genomics is changing. That is some of the most exciting life science companies are selling developing energy solutions to companies that are… So it is morphing together, the sectors are morphing together? That is right. You have that blending where some of the largest customers for these life science companies are actually energy companies. Do you have a company with a vaccine for the swine flu? It is working on it. If anybody in here is not feeling well you can leave in your time in life. Oh, don't you stay for Steve as a cold today. Just a cold we promise. Thank you Steve for showing up as well. Steve has been on the weather. So Jennifer, how is it different to… I mean, since you have been on the board and done investments in digital companies, all the IT companies and medical companies because you have done some wonderful work there and now are growing practice if you will in clean tech. So what is different about them? Do they have any… Is there any way to differentiate them in your mind in terms of… Or is it just that the common principles of launch ownership are the same? It is just different business models or something. In many ways it is the same and in many ways they are wildly different. So it is obviously the devil in the details. Certainly for starting a young company it really is about a tremendous team and we back great entrepreneurial teams and diverse teams. So there is nothing worse than assembling a team where everybody has the same background and it looks the same, it smells the same. It just tends not to work as well. So at the core of every investment that we do it is always about the great teams. But there are differences. There are differences in the time cycle to get to a product, to build a company. At the end of the day when you think about venture capital you are thinking about building businesses and while great teams and great products and great emerging markets all coalesce to build those great companies at the end of the day you still have to build great companies. So you have to make sure that the business model works. There is distribution channels and so those are all quite different in many of those examples. In medical devices you may have an FDA process where you have to go through and you may have different amounts of capital required before you actually get a product to market. In clean energy we have companies that could be very capital efficient particularly in areas like lighting where the whole notion of how you can reduce your energy demand by 40 to 60% by how you think about managing your lighting systems. That is a very important emerging theme that is very capital efficient. But then you may have going after renewables like this company I described BrightSource which is 7 billion of backlogs but the capital required to build out those facilities is anywhere from 500 billion to a billion dollars to build those out just like it would be to build out a utility level. So I forgot to ask what she was talking about the clean tech investing. Do you see any lack of enthusiasm? Other than the sort of being locked up with the economy but in general. I think it is a two part question. I think it is a lack of enthusiasm absolutely not. I attend conferences, talk to venture capitalists and other types of investors all the time and there is a very high level of enthusiasm for clean tech. The second thing is are people actively investing outside of their own funds right now. I think because of the macro economy things had slowed and I don't think that is a secret Jennifer can talk about that a little bit more. But has nothing to do with really the sector there are some investments being made but not nearly at the pace or will be once things recover. So just to finish out on the point about the differences. You know Cheryl Sandberg was here last week talking about Facebook and how they surpassed 200 million users in their platform. How you scale these businesses is dramatically different. So how you scale a Facebook and how you attract users and distribute your product is so dramatically different than BioFuelBox which is fundamentally about establishing local relationships that may not extend beyond 50 kilometers from where they put down their plant where they are getting their waste product in and they are putting their biofuel out. 50 kilometer problem versus Facebook which is can be a worldwide platform and both can be wildly successful businesses but how you think about scale in those different types of companies is can be night and day. Yes. Alright so should we talk a little bit about some micro issues of the relationship between the entrepreneur and the VC. Sure if you like. You look forward to it. You know I just did mine else but I didn't. So get my box and gloves on. Let's approach it this way. Why don't we start with this the fundamental decision that you made. Your team made to search for and choose venture capital as a source of capital. As opposed to bootstrapping or development projects or other sources. So what are the pros and cons of that where what you will listen to BioFuelBox story two years ago. And I mentioned my background I sort of had a variety of experiences growing companies from the bootstrapped in the very first one and understanding the benefits and the drawbacks to that even though we were profitable and eventually sold the company to bring in outside venture capital and the benefits there. And I think it really depends on what the entrepreneur is trying to accomplish. If you are just trying to build solve a particular problem build a company that you want to control and run for a decade or more on your own there is a lot of different avenues to fund that company including bootstrapping it yourself. I think though when you take a look at what it takes at least in my experience to build a successful company when you really identify an opportunity it's about speed and I think when you look at speed time to market you think of New York you think finance you think of Texas you think oil you think Silicon Valley it's about speed. So therefore that's what I have sort of had embedded into my DNA and to that end we looked at more than just the money when it became time to get outside investors. We self-funded the company for a year and a half until we had a working prototype. So we are in a pretty good position in 2007 to raise a $9 million dollars so it wasn't about raising the money it was really about selecting the right partner for us. I think in a few key areas one that would add credibility to us because as a startup one of the toughest things to get is credibility. So if you can partner with those that can assist you in that area like DFJ and element partners that really accelerates your growth and I'll give you an example of that. As soon as we closed our round at the very first board meeting Jennifer and John Rockwell our other board member said go out right now and get a growth line from Silicon Valley bank you might need to extend your run later. What's a group? It's a credit vehicle that allows us to draw down additional capital should we need it. And sure enough based on the reputation of the two investors in addition to what we were doing we were able to achieve that line of credit and we would have arguably never been able to do it that quickly or that easily on our own. I think the second thing that to consider is relationships. So we were new to the clean tech space and we didn't have a lot of the relationships in this area that the element partners who's been investing in clean tech since before it was called clean tech and Jennifer has through their sets of experiences across a wide variety of clean tech companies. So we're able to get introduced to people and get invited to speak at events and become thought leaders and things like that because of the value that those types of partners can bring to us. And then I think that the next thing is building a strong board. So I mentioned my second company I had a dysfunctional board and it killed the company. One of the biggest strengths we have in biofuel boxes is an extraordinarily gifted set of board members, such as Tom, Jennifer and John Rockwell that really passionately believe in what we're trying to accomplish and give us great advice. And as Jennifer knows it's not always the message that I want to hear which is giving me advice. But you know what? When I sit back and absorb it it's usually exactly what I needed to hear to move the company forward. There's a ton of value besides the money that venture capital. So long story short we want venture capital this time around. Being extraordinarily selective as to which partner we went with because they had a lot more value than just money. And I think the other thing is clearly additional capital. So we go out for our next round of funding. Do we have people around the table that are willing to invest in the next round? And if you go with a venture capital firm normally the answer is yes. So how many boards do you sit on right now? Actively. I'm currently on nine boards. Nine boards? Yes. So we're her favorite. So let's do a little bit of pattern recognition here. So what kind of what makes for an effective relationship with those CEOs? Those nine different CEOs for you as the investor of board member? When it's working well, why? Right. What's going on? Right. So it is both a direct relationship and a community relationship because you have a direct relationship with the CEO as well as a community relationship with the board. And so I do want to underscore a steves point that having an effective group of people around the table grappling with issues because one of the things that often gets lost is that it's really hard to build companies. Things do not work the way you think they will work. They do not work within the timeframe. You will work. Some of the companies that have blown up that we've seen have blown up typically because there's internal fighting. The amount of internal fighting amongst whether it's the founders or key members of the team ends up sucking an enormous, sex-to-life blood out of companies sometimes. And so when you have this very strong and honest communication between the CEO and then within that community, within the board, that helps carry through a lot of the ups and downs that drive, that it's inherent in the volatility of a startup. So I'm out. I'm going to get so tactical here or just down to the level of the mechanics of all this. Now I get to ask this a good bit. So how often are the board meetings monthly? Is that typical for your other companies or depends on their stage? Yes. When you speak about now anything, how can you manage all that? And the issue of course is that those companies are in different sectors and those companies are different stages. And so we do have initially companies spend, where we spend board meetings monthly and we're often dealing with a lot of strategic issues as well as personnel issues and hiring issues at that juncture. But as companies get larger, they can meet every six weeks, every eight weeks, even quarterly in some cases. So before we open up the Q&A, how about this is a wrap up. Put yourself back in their shoes. I'm talking about some of the students here, the undergrad and the grads. She goes state or back to Georgetown. And if you had a chance to talk to yourself at the time, give yourself a piece of advice. As our colleague wrote in her book, when I wish I knew when I was 20, I'll get you a chance to put an dent in Monti in the C.O.L. book. So what advice do you have? People are here by choice. The students are here by choice because they are interested in entrepreneurship. Do you have any wisdom to pass along? Is this on your career or what's going on now? I think the biggest piece of advice I've got is you can't succeed as an entrepreneur unless you're passionate about what you're doing. So don't even attempt to start a company unless you really believe in its mission and objective and what it's trying to accomplish. Hopefully that aligns with your personal beliefs. I think the second thing is have fun along the way. This is a wild roller coaster ride every time. If you're not having fun and I like to use the analogy standing on the top of a pole 300 feet in the air, just look around. Don't look down. If you're walking a tightrope, don't look down. Just look at the end game because there are plenty of problems. Surround yourself with good people. You know, a great team. What did Jensen say a few weeks ago? Start-ups or... The definition of a start-up is a company constantly going out of business. Is that what he said? Yeah, that's a good one. How about you, Jensen? So definitely the notion of passion and the importance of passion in your life, whatever you choose to do, whether it's about entrepreneurship. Don't get bogged down in career building. I think that's trying to build a career as a misnomer. What you're trying to do is figure out what you get you excited and get you passionate, get you going in the morning. And don't be afraid to take the leap. Then don't take yourself too seriously if it doesn't quite work the way you want. One of the things I liked about Cheryl's comment last week was be a player and not a victim. And it's about the folks that are in the game that are ready to make mistakes, that are ready to take responsibility and jump in the game versus the blame game and pointing the fingers and looking around and everything's external. It's about you and you're going to make mistakes and you're going to be passionate and you're going to have to take that leap. I think it's probably fairly well known in this community although it's not as well known in others but they say that the optimal age for starting a business is actually 28 because you have just enough experience to really be able to think about how to build. That's how you were when you started off your box. That's how he was up there in the head. It's all, it could be a mental thing but not necessarily enough to know that you don't have the baggage of being older and feeling like all the things that could go wrong. You think about the world and how things could go right. And so I encourage you to think of life as an adventure and get, find what you're passionate about or whatever that may be. Well when I think passion and adventure and biofuel box, let's just see. The prototype last summer where the engineering team went with it to test it out. What was the temperature in Arkansas? There were 5 to 110 and about 99 percent humidity. Fahrenheit. Fahrenheit. Temperature was ridiculous. The humidity of what? Probably 90 plus. And they were there for a month in August in Arkansas. Not a place you necessarily want to vacation. Right now. Right. And then so that's the prototype and then this production unit, NidaHoe, what's been the average temperature up there? Well in the winter minus four. So it's been stress test. So I'd say that's passion and adventure. And the people that have joined us, you know, why would you leave a 20 year career at a Fortune 500 company because they're passionate about what we're doing? And that's what drives them. It's certainly a lot riskier than a Fortune 500 job you've been at for 20 years. You do it because you believe in the cause. There's got to be some feed stock in Hawaii. There's just got to be some right. We'll get there. Last word before we're open up. Okay. Let's check some Q and A. Just raise your hand and I'll repeat the question. How about right here? This is for Jennifer. What are the top two? What are the traits you have seen in the top two? Could you repeat the question? Sure. So the question was what are the top two traits that I've seen in the worst CEOs and if I could, I'll extend that to CEOs or founders because the founders are fundamental to the game. I think the number one is the belief set that they are invincible and that they know everything. That is, I've seen that quite a bit and it happens both, it happens with technical folks and it happens with business folks. They don't really appreciate all the different dimensions that it takes to build a business and that the skill sets around the table don't have to be just a technical skill set. And does the technical skills get set extend to how you think about managing the finances or managing market development? That is a fundamental challenge is recognizing that you need to do that. And then the second, which is linked to that, which is hiring well and you have to be pretty self aware of what you're good at and what you're not good at to be able to hire well. And so the folks that don't do well, I think, tend to hire people that look like them, have a similar background to them or similar mindset to them. And there's a lot of work today in the education circles about a closed mindset versus an open mindset. And typically you find people with a closed mindset blame a lot of other people, hire people that look like them, don't understand or appreciate folks with different backgrounds and they don't hire well. And people with an open mindset can adapt to different folks and seek them out. You're nodding you head. It was. I agree with Jennifer saying, and I reminded the fact that I have a wonderful wife and two very strong young teenage daughters that remind me every day, I'm not even the smartest guy in the house. The smartest guy in the company. So I think always trying to improve yourself when you're hiring is really what you're trying to do, improve the company. And it's cliche, but the team is what makes the company succeed, not any individual. I can say we build companies that were if any single individual left tomorrow, we'd still be strong. And one other thing I'll just throw in here because hasn't been explicitly said is that VCs can help, but at the end of the day, CEOs run the companies. They hire and fire the founders, the employees, they make the choices about which customers to go to. The venture capitalists are a resource and our goal is to help. But if anyone perceives that we're in any way trying to make a decision on behalf of the company itself, running that company, hiring an employee, we don't do that. And CEOs need to take that leadership themselves. Question right here. I have a question on the metrics of the company. You mentioned $30 a barrel. How much volume is actually coming in? How much volume of fuel is going out? And what's the cost of processing? In other words, you've got a capital cost to the plant. Sure. And then you have an operating cost to the plant. And then it sounds like you're giving your material for free, but then you have to return the percentage of the fuel. So the question is about the economics of the company. The single plant. The economics of the single plant. So allow me to answer this. You don't mind? Because I'm not going to be able to answer it in this open forum that's being podcasted everywhere. I want to. It's proprietary. But I can't tell you this since day one, as Jennifer mentioned, our objective was to be price competitive with petroleum diesel fuel at $30 a barrel equivalent. Now we've done the market analysis of the historical pricing. An inflation adjusted of crude oil for the last 40 years. It's $35 a barrel. For the last 100 years, it's $20 a barrel. So we targeted $30 a barrel because we believe that long-term, can you depend on mandates to drive your company and keep it successful? These are tax incentives. These are tax incentives. Tax incentives or requirements to use the fuel. No. So we're going to be able to sell the low price fuel if it's equivalent to what's being sold. And we target being a nickel less than petroleum diesel over time. So if you run the math, we're very profitable at $2 a gallon fuel. That's about as specific as they'd be willing to get here. So you've been in some sense of that operating expenditure and the sense of, like, is it a very profitable company at 89 percent if you're making lots of small diagnostic tests to be... So I guess the question is, what are the years you could be? How profitable are you to make it work? So how hard are you working for profit, I guess? It depends on the price of fuel because the price of the inputs fixed, the price of the operating costs pretty fixed. And so it really rides with the sale of fuel. But as I say, we're very comfortable and nicely profitable at current prices and can be profitable and in business. The day this plant ships its first gallon of fuel, it will be profitable in a nice rate. And that's about as specific as I'm willing to get. Sorry. All right. Let's do some more questions right here. Oh, there's a little bit of a fact. The idea of good building a team. Jennifer, you had mentioned that it's very important to have a sense of community and an open form of communication. And you had mentioned that it's also important to have the people who are the best in a technical field. So I was wondering what your thoughts are on how to navigate that trade-off. Do you go into business with people you really trust and are very close to you or do you go into business with people who have every single technical skill that is needed to get the company out of the ground? Can you attempt to repeat that question? No, I like it. All right. Let me see if I can ask them. Let me see if I can repeat that. So the question is, and please correct me if I'm wrong. Do you go into a company, do you go into a starting company or building a company or investing in a company where the technical team is fully in place with all of the technical skills required or not? Is that, did I capture that? Yeah. And well, like, sometimes you have to balance having the people with those skills. Or even if they're not technical skills, you know, the CFO might be a really good CFO, it might just be a person who you don't like very much. Right. Sure, sure, sure. So I guess a secondary piece of that is whether that person is also some that you can get along with and work well with and how closely do you know them. And so I think each story is different. You are, you're not going to have no company starts with every skill set in place. And they, and not many people I know, have really close friendships with the broad basis skills of everything you would need for a company. It's just that type of relationship doesn't typically exist. It certainly helps if you've been through several startups because you can start to pick and choose from some of those organizations. And that helps and you can learn about people through the relationships in this sort of in the Kevin Bacon, second and third order type of relationships. They can help support that. But you just, you just don't have that, that luxury in most cases. And as venture capitalists, we don't require everything to be in place. In fact, it almost never is. It's typically two or three folks in an idea, perhaps prototype, proof of concept. And the company building exercises is bringing in folks that have both the, the diversity of skill sets as well as the personal relationships that they can build that may not necessarily be in place at the beginning. So, so that is the, the fragility of any organization is getting that formula right. Thanks. On over here. Any comment on the law strategy for the box in the exergy of the lab? Sure. Oh, repeat. Repeat the question. So, the question was, could I comment on the rollout strategy and the exit strategy of biofuel box? The rollout strategy is, is fairly straightforward, which is team with those partners that preferably have multiple sites. So you look at industrial food processors, animal renders. You know, they, most of the big ones have multiple sites. So we looked to do like at Sonic Wall, we didn't sell one firewall, we looked to sell 100. By a fuel box, we don't look to necessarily install one plant, we look to solve problems across a network of plants. And to that end, we are actually teaming with leaders in the wastewater treatment area that already have these relationships because we've identified our businesses as being most attractive when we're dealing with waste streams that are coming through wastewater treatment streams. So who knows where those bones are buried and in the proper quantities? The folks that have been selling to those guys for 20 years. It's a very relationship driven business. So we're teaming in that space, which is why we now think of ourselves as a waste remediation company. So that's really our go-to-market there. And then we, and then they have reps and consultants and all kinds of folks that we're building that, that works worth of expertise with. And then we're, you know, from an exit strategy, when we hit our milestones and we're, we're achieving our objectives in the IPO market. Someday recovers. Certainly will be in a great position as an IPO, but also when you think of us and you think of the biofuels market, you know, not so attractive as an acquisition target as a biofuels company, but arguably very attractive potentially over time as a wastewater treatment bolt on it. Because we're now generating recurring revenue in an industry where we've captured the channels attention and the customer base's attention. And it's an easy add-on for those leaders that are selling capital equipment. They aren't building a whole lot more waste water treatment plants from scratch, but they're always adding on. So, therefore you might want to comment on them. IPO. IPO. Remember those? Hey, it was good to me. Yeah, I know everyone thinks, I know it feels so foreign, but I still believe that that opportunity will still be there for us in a few years. Yeah. So, I got a question. Does it came with the mic? Well, how is this? It goes back when you talked about the attitudes in Washington as well as other capitals around the world that were in general there, at least, the favorable conditions. And in fact, there's this massive amount of spending that's going up in science and technology as well as the sort of formal aspects of the stimulus package. What does this really mean for a startup? I mean, how does it filter down, how does it trickle or filter down or what does this mean for somebody like Biofuelbox or some of your other investments? How are they reacting to this stimulus that's supposedly coming from DC? Pretty money. So, I was in DC about three weeks ago with my empty bucket knocking them all the doors and nobody filled it. Savage board. Yeah, I think at least from a Biofuelbox perspective in Jennifer can comment on clean tech in general. We're certainly pursuing this stimulus money and all this free money that's becoming available. In our case, in our industry, there's a lot of confusion around Biofuel because of the fact that the big guys focused on food as an input and they're 80% of the BioDecil folks are mothballed right now. And the DOE hasn't been recently educated as to waste to fuel plays, particularly at a regional level. So, it's this Catch-22 where money's coming but nobody knows who's going to be on the receiving end yet because the definitions are still being debated. So, it'll be interesting to see how the definitions of who's eligible is going to be giant plants only. Are they going to allow companies that have distributed models? And so, we're dealing with a lot of lobbyists getting their opinions, a lot of attorneys and DC getting their opinions. But in Biofuel's in particular, there's a little bit of uncertainty around the execution of that. So, I think there's both federal capital and then there's state capital and then there's state mandates and then ultimately someday there will be federal mandates that are driving the debate in the opportunity set here. So, for a company like Biofuel Box which is a relatively unknown company, they are best served by pursuing both state and federal level opportunities. Number one, in number two, they are best served by partnering with their customers or feedstock suppliers to come together as a consortium to reach out for stimulus money. So, the stimulus money is looking to be leveraged money. They don't want to just give it to $1 equals $1 equals maybe a quarter of a job. They want it $1 to equal $4 which could equal $4 jobs. And so, they're looking for consortiums and opportunities for customers and the full supply chain to come together and present a proposal for why if they get this money, they will be able to provide significant leverage into that local economy in order to justify that to the stimulus dollars. And so, we've encouraged our companies like Biofuel Box to have conversations with potential customers, potential partners along the feedstock side to bring together bulk and provide an obvious path for legislators to feel as if they are using the taxpayers' dollars to most leveraged and most effective outcome. All right. Well, let me start by saying, please tell your partners at DFJ. We so much appreciate the support for underwriting this series. It's been another great year.
