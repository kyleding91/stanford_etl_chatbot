 Stanford E. Corner presents the Odd Pearl Thought Leader series. Okay, our first guest is Dr. M. Sangen, who's an environmental scientist, specializing in the role of conservation and saving people in nature. He serves as conservation international's chief executive officer. Our other guest is Harrison Ford, who serves as vice chairman of the board of conservation international. He is strongly committed to environmental concerns and is served on the board of conservation international for decades. Please join me in welcoming our special guest. So, thank you so much for coming all the way to Stanford to talk to our students. How many of you were familiar with conservation international? Raise your hand. Okay, only a few. Well, this is an incredible opportunity to educate everyone, and I think we're going to have a really meaningful discussion. Can you tell us a little bit about the organization, the mission, the vision? You know, why is this organization been around for so long? Sangen, maybe, do you want to start? Well, I hasn't been around for so long. Harrison, you want to start? I wouldn't know where to finish. Why don't we ask Sangen to... Sure. Is that a problem that we need to solve? If the ocean is talking. Maybe. Oh, okay. So, I'd just say, conservation international has been around for about 30 years, almost exactly 30 years, a little bit more than that. And it was found on a very simple premise, and that is people need nature to thrive. That it's a new, enlightened self-interest to protect these things, the land, the water, wildlife that's around us, because it ultimately provides everything that we have from your jobs, to food, to medicine, to virtually, to air we breathe. When people ask me what's the mission of the organization, I usually just sort of cut down to, like, one simple line, which is, we try to protect that part of nature that is of most value to people. And it's important that I bounce that out with that word that's most important to people. And if you ask the simple question, why? Why not just protect all of nature? I'd be fine with that. I'd personally be fine with that. But it turns out that if you really want conservation to stick, if you want to stick in faraway places that you may never get to see, like Liberia or Suriname or Madagascar or Indonesia or Brazil, places that we work in, then at the end of the day, once our attention ships somewhere else, we have to have created some kind of virtuous cycle that will allow that conservation of nature to continue long after we're gone. And if people aren't involved in that dialogue, then it won't happen. It will always be a niche, there will always be a hobby, there will always be something that people who have will participate in and people who don't simply just don't have the opportunity to do it. So this wonderful video is really moving, but it also points out that there are a lot of people in very powerful positions who aren't engaged in this. And in fact, deny that this is a problem or want to avoid it. How do you deal with that? How do you deal with solving this problem when there are people who are really not engaged? Well, part of the way of dealing with it is to create economic alternatives to unsustainable development. That's one of the very things we started with. When I joined Conservation International 30 years ago, we had a three to five million dollar budget and we were picking up Todd Wernuts, which are palm nuts, and selling them to Patagonia to make buttons out of. And we were giving people an economic alternative to unsustainable development. And that continues to be the model that I think is most useful. So people were involved in entrepreneurial enterprises. I think are a big part of the solution to create new ways of addressing the issues to create. To take advantage of the technology to create jobs and a marketplace that helps affect the condition of nature. One of the things that's been most fused is the notion of monetizing the services of nature, putting an actual value on them and allowing that information to generate change. We can't provide for ourselves. We don't have the technology. We don't have the capital to provide for ourselves what nature provides to us in its healthy state, clean water from an undisturbed watershed, clean air, which we've got a very pressing need for. Sources of food, sources of pollination. All of these things are the services of nature that we cannot afford as human beings replicate for ourselves. And there are economic opportunities. And I'm delighted when I see the amount of... I just... I saw Al Gore two years ago at Ted in Vancouver. And he gave a talk ten years after his first talk. He talked about how the effects of climate change, the detrimental effects of climate change, had progressed even faster than anticipated. But even greater, even more important than that perhaps, was the fact that the costs of alternative sources of energy had come down much more. That while degradation was going on at a greater rate than thought, the costs of alternative energy were becoming less and less. So there is great hope in technology. There's great hope in the business model for change. Please, just one thing to that. So I completely agree. You know, look, the folks right now, either in this country or on the world, who are still in denial. Hope that's something good to drink. Are doing so willfully. There is probably a small percentage of the population who somehow doesn't really believe it. But I think really smart business people, really smart politicians, really smart individuals, they are making a choice to ignore what's right in front of them. It is no longer a question of, you don't know, it just does not ring true to me. And everywhere around the world that I travel, I see leaders in business and leaders in civil society and government repeatedly, you know, emphasize this message that the time is now sustainable is a real issue we need to deal with. This morning, I had breakfast with the vice president of Guyana, the interesting guy is an indigenous leader. Guyana is a small country in South America where 85% of the country is forced. And we are sitting right here, just very close to here, and he looked at the hills. He's basically looking over at the, so the hills that divide this area from the coast, sort of, I'd say, like, wood side, the hills about that. And he's like, how is all of that still green? Like, you know, why isn't it all houses? And I said it's the watershed for San Francisco. And it's like a life hub going off in his head. And because because that's exactly what we're talking about in Guyana with him, but what was a life hub for him is that he just sort of start thought, look, this is the richest place on the planet you can possibly imagine. And even here, people need an economic incentive in order to protect nature. So we have a room full of people who are very entrepreneurial. Many of these folks are going to go out and start companies. How do you bake this type of thinking into new ventures so that when they get started, this isn't something that gets added in later, it gets something that baked in in the beginning, thinking about these things in the way you manufacture the way you distribute the type of products you you provide. And how do you do that? Is that something that you spend time thinking about and working on? Yeah. Well, I think Walmart, for instance, spent a lot of time thinking about it and changed their business model significantly to be able to represent to their customers and to their employees. And so they were doing their part in creating sustainable supply routes for the products that they offered. And I think they worked to their advantage and it reduced their costs. So I mean, there's one example of a company that has made real strides in that area. And I know that there are lots of stories. I spent some time on your website, which was very impressive in terms of the breadth and depth of the types of things you're doing. It would be great if you could maybe share a couple of stories of examples of this type of transition and the type of levers that you've been able to use in order to affect change. From the very beginning of conservation international, we had on our original board, a man named Chuck Headlin, who was an executive of Exxon Oil. We thought a lot of the conservation community resisted our working with people in the extractive industries. But we worked with Exxon to improve their practices in the field to create a system of best practices, which not only helped protect the people who were. Who were living close to their oil fields and and and the places where they were doing their work, but, but made them more attractive to their. So their shareholders. And we thought, I mean conservation international was people found that suspicious that we are willing to work with with business. But business had had really worked stepped up to the plate for us. And I think our history with business has been very, very important in January, very popular. So having worked in the conservation and national been involved for so long, having seen some significant shifts in the way the organization is looking at change and the types of opportunities has there been some insight that has led to different types of programs. Well, we started out talking about biodiversity and migration pathways for animals. And really we are our definition of of the work that that we need to do that needs be done shifts from day to day. We really have found that our most important product is strategic thinking. Ways of addressing the issues that continue to crop up. Ways to manage the available resources and to move people to be positively contribute to the solutions for the environmental problems that we have. I mean, I'd say look, we're relatively modest size organization. We're small enough to be nimble but big enough to have an impact at the scale of a country. And if you're in that space, you want to be either the first or you want to be the last. There's value to being both, right, in terms of the cost of entry and the impact you can have. You know, what a couple of things that just in reflection on sort of the questions you ask about entrepreneurship and how the business when we started. And I look, I've only been at CI for three years and I've been the CEO for all of seven months. It's a day by day enterprise for who will see how that goes. But I'll say that I've been in conservation for a long time and the one thing I've noticed with businesses is, you know, business are doing it because it really is in their own interest now sustainability equals availability. Companies are no longer doing it because of, you know, CSR reasons, right? You're not doing it simply to be a good player or a good actor. It's well beyond that right now. So when we started with Starbucks, a company that you go into Starbucks, pick up a bag coffee, looking back, you'll see our logo on it. That's a hard thing to do. Get your logo onto something like so branded like Starbucks, right? It happened over a period of almost 20 years. When we started, they had like 5% of their coffee chain in a sustainable supply. Today, it's essentially 100%. So every drop of coffee that you buy at Starbucks basically comes from a farm, we're talking 350,000 farmers in dozens of countries around the world where you cannot cut a tree down in order to grow coffee. You have to send your kid to school if you're going to sell coffee to Starbucks and then a variety of other metrics, including, you know, pesticide use, water use, etc, etc. Now, Starbucks is doing it partly to be a good social citizen, but they're doing it also because, genuinely, there's fundamental issues about land that is available for coffee growing in an euro of climate change, in a euro of dramatic change. So it really is in their own interest to be ahead of this. And I think Walmart and all the other companies are doing that as well. When CI gets involved in a project, for the most part, we're hopefully trying to be a little disruptive. We're kind of coming at something and starting to ask a question like, how can we think about this project in a entirely different way and sort of step back and see if there's something fundamental we can shake that can just tip the whole thing over. And there's not a lot of value in being, you know, a player that's just going to do something that everyone else is doing, at least for our organization and the scale that we were. So what kind of levers do you view that you have when you go into these organizations or these whole systems? Where are the places where you go? Okay, this is the, if I push this button, something big is going to happen. Sure, let's talk, I can't give you one story. So this is one of my favorite stories about really an innovative project that someone at CI did. So there's a woman named Sarah for Zee. She works in South Africa office. She's worked in this program for like 15 years, we're really trying to figure out something. A lot of Southern Africa, we're talking about Namibia, Botswana, South Africa, countries like that are heavily fenced. And the fences have been put in sort of during colonialism and then after that. And it divides land that you have cattle in and places that you have wildlife in. And the reason for that is they want to keep cattle away from wildlife because of transmission of certain diseases, like foot and mouth disease. Foot and mouth disease won't harm you or the meat you eat, but it couldn't impact dairy production. So they want to keep them apart. Now what started off as a kind of a good idea of growing a cat local cattle industry really had very perverse incentive. Because what happened in South Africa for example is that the people who ended up with the land that is disease free tended to be either white or privileged or somehow politically connected. And the people who ended up with all that wildlife land to have cattle on tended to be mostly black, mostly indigenous, mostly communities. So they have lots and lots of cattle but absolutely no market for it. Just to put this in perspective in a country like Botswana, you have 300,000 people employed in the cattle industry, 300,000 out of population of 2 million. Of that only 700 out of 300,000 have access to market. So this is a major problem. So how do you change it? You can't talk to community about raising better or being more wildlife friendly. A chief told me in South Africa right outside Krugan, Asia Park, the premier wildlife destination all of Africa said to me, I will care about your rhinos when you care about my cattle. So the traditional model has been trying to take these cows and doing some sort of quarantine. Doesn't work for lots of reason I can tell you later. So what our person did eventually is hit upon and pretty brilliant idea. She created a mobile butcher shop, a mobile avatar. And so moving the cattle to market, she just brought the market to the cow. So she built the machine, she built the whole thing, you know, it's like state of the art, we have the intellectual property on it. She also created an online auctioning system. So long story short, if you go to Krugan, Asia Park right now, you can go and stay at $2,000 a night larger owned by people like Richard Brandt. There's a fence right outside the fence is the poorest black community in all of South Africa. Right there right next to this $2,000 a night fence. Those community members for the first time ever this summer were able to sell their cows into the park for those largest that you stay before that the meat was coming from at least 200 miles away. In one case it was coming from Norway. Imagine that you're importing beef from Norway to feed tourists in a large one this cow six kilometers away. So it was just this transformation that had major social impact it's like it's subversive what she did right she created a system by which you can bring that there and now we can actually talk to this community now the community actually starting to ask okay I get it I get why this park actually adds value to my life. Because this thing that I care so much about my cattle I can actually sell I have a market for it. So you know innovation is not just in that case there's engineering there is kind of an online app that she created that brings all the people together for the right sale but it's also fundamentally asking a question about justice and society and asking what why is it this way and how can we. What an interesting story thank you an amazing person at some point I'm sure that there are so many stories like that in a few minutes I'm going to open it up to questions and we'll sort of go back and forth with questions from. The audience and also questions from me so start thinking about your burning questions here. That that was an interesting story and I wonder how you measure success okay because success in the short run and the long run are really interesting things in an organization such as conservation international I'm sure you have some metrics that you that you're you know you got some dashboard there you're looking at and saying how are we how are we doing against our goals. I never well enough so there continues to be a struggle to perfect models that we that we have but metrics are very important and and they need to be transparent as well and that was a that was a very important part of how we organize our work right and a lot of a lot of work that's done. Through CI is we pass through funds which we are able to which we are able to get from governments from international institutions to people who are who have a have a model of change and but we we are very concerned with the metrics of a measure. So we are a measuring the effect of those things and that's why when I talk about strategy of this organization it that's a central focus for me absolutely. Yeah there's a beautiful quote on the wall somewhere on the floor around here about you know the question that you asked nature and and the answer that nature gives back is sort of you know measurement is that is it sort of the answer that nature gives back you can't ask the question if you don't have the right measure set up for it. It's a massive challenge for every conservation organization it's easy in some ways to say I'm saving this species or this place the minute you get beyond that you talk about a whole river system or a whole landscape or a seascape becomes really complicated. So we have proximate metrics of activity but then we also look at the long term things which have to do with both human well being but also the state of that ecosystem for me what I use in some ways as a measure I want to ask myself is this project can this project stand on its own feet even after we're gone. There is no pride in being a place for a very long time if you are a nonprofit because it your job should be to put yourself out of a job in every place you work. And if you approach it in that way you approaching it with a life cycle of a project it means that within 10 years I want every project that we do essentially be self-sustained self-generating create a virtual cycle within that project now you might have some level of philanthropy in there but philanthropy cannot be the driver of that kind of. The assistant change has to be the kick in the ass get things going. So how do you create a movement I mean we were we were chatting about this earlier you know are there any analogies of other issues that have been really difficult to tackle and how what can we learn from that. Well right now there's a lot you go first because I definitely have a feeling of it. Well I have a lot of feelings and it's very complex movements. We spent a lot of time talking about helping to create a movement for change. And the problem in my mind is that movements are much more likely to sell t-shirts than they are to make change. And they very quickly shift. But it's very hard to use a movement to create these the specific kinds of activity which are necessary to make the change. But again we're seeing today students of this high school in Florida are making are in a position because of the very feeling that is part of their dilemma. Part of what they're talking about is so strong emotionally that it cuts across across a lot of resistance. And I'm seeing what I think is a moment where we may begin to address the issue of gun violence because of the passion and the immediacy of their access to the means of communication and the way we feel when we see these things. So do we have to have situations like that with regard to the environment to stimulate a movement? Does it have to be a crisis? I don't know if it has to be but you know I the first time I came to America I was at I don't know 12 years old and my parents brought me here on a vacation and we went to two places. New York and Los Angeles and that was my impression of America in the 80s which you know made that that basically killed my chance of coming to school in America for my parents. But I distinctly remember landing in Los Angeles and not being able to see like any of the buildings because of the pollution in the air it was extraordinary. And now you fly in on a routine basis and it's it's completely different and if you fly to go into China you know this year I was just in Beijing like a month ago it had unusual air quality in terms of good air quality you could actually see the building across the road and things like that because they they've done a pretty intense campaign to get rid of coal fired sort of heating plants in their houses. I think if there's something immediate like that you you know citizens in Delhi citizens in Beijing are demanding change in terms of air quality and I think it'll happen faster than we predict like it did in Los Angeles when something like that just seemed like just the way it was ever always going to be. But I think for some of the other changes that we talk about you know what's happening to the city occasion the oceans or even climate change and so that it's it's harder I agree it is a bit harder. I think you need some empathy and I think you need I think you need people to be able to see a pathway to make that change it real in their lives right because I think despair alone won't get you there you have to have some level of shock or despair coupled with the ability to actually do something about it. I think also I'm reminded of a situation when I was trying to get my parents to recycle years and years ago and they thought I was very quaint that I was recycling you know newspapers we have newspapers in those days and until the dump in their town got filled up and they were getting charged lots of extra money for having another garbage can and guess what they started doing recycling so that once they had a financial incentive so I think you know you can there people who are motivated for very different things so I think you know you can get a lot of money for the people do you think about those different levels you know the some people are going to be motivated by empathy and the long term vision and those people really just have to hit their pocketbook. Yeah no for sure look I I protect nature because I just love it you know I still hang on to a little place in Montana because I like going for a walk in the woods knowing there's something bigger than me. Jump out of the forest and bite my head off and it kind of works for me just puts a little bit of you know interested all our lives but that proposition save the forest because it might kill you just really not going to work for the majority of the plan. So you know I think you need to meet folks where they are and you have to make whatever the cause that you think is so important you know how is it that Harrison myself and our board and some of my friends who are in this audience are dedicating in my in my case and in my life. Many of our cases a huge part of our lives to this because we think it's so important and yet so many people we see feel like or seem like they're walking around the world with blinders on right and that strikes me it it it scares me and I think it's part of it is has to do with making it reasonable and interesting and important to their life in something that matters to them not in terms of what matters to me I think the big challenge of the environment would be honest. We've always been screaming the message about why it's important to whoever is screaming that message as opposed to meeting folks where they're at great so who gets the first question. Back there we stand up and speak really loud. Thank you so much that was really very moving so for those people who might be listening on the podcast and didn't hear she's from Costa Rica and I was talking about the impact. The conservation international has had very specifically on the country thank you so much. But Costa Rica is really a leader when it comes to valuation of nature and natural capital and they have been a transformative nation in a lot of ways we bring people from Rwanda and from Kenya and other countries to visit Costa Rica to learn about how Costa Rica is really created a little bit of an economy. The green economy. So when else have a question great over here please stand up. So I'm going to repeat the question the question is how do you implement these programs with cultural sensitivity because you're going to place of the world that are quite different than then where you may come from. Well first of all we have staff in those countries we don't even put me impose ourselves on these countries we have people scientists people who work in that country we have indigenous people who have protected their part of nature working with us. We're very sensitive to local cultures and the importance of engaging people in an appropriate way. We don't work very much in the United States except as to influence the policy of the United States government to access the potential that the United States government has to support international conservation. But we're what in our field programs we do we work with local local people. And in Hawaii that's the one place that we do have field presence a lot of that program is with Hawaiian indigenous Hawaiian communities. So you know we have pretty strong policies on you know prior informed consent. It kind of drives the way in which we engage with communities that's a policy for CI we abide by it we're quite strict about how that engagement happens. Most of our staff are from the countries that we work in as Harrison said and I think you start the conversation by actually asking folks what is it that you want and it's surprising those answers tend to be quiet straightforward and something that virtually every one of you will also understand. So we've got a room filled with students from across different disciplines lots of engineering students if you're engineering student raise your hand great lots of engineering students what about people from humanities who are in the room great lot of those anyone in business is a student. They didn't find their way across campus but one over here okay a lot of students do any lawyers in the room okay but hey we've got a really diverse group how would you say by more. So we want to do lots of different types of engineers okay but these engineers want to change the world okay we've got electrical engineers mechanical engineers and computer scientists how would you encourage them to think about the world. So we want them to think about the types of things they can do here they are looking and wanting to make an impact I mean the students I meet are really hungry to find ways that they can do things that have a positive impact on the world. So I start to look you're probably doing what you're doing because at one point I was doing exactly the same thing that you wanted to make a difference and I think you know I think the awesome thing about this is where you start into this career you start into college you start into life in that sense you really want to make a difference. Some along the way that gets sort of you know it falls to the wayside sometimes but that's where you're starting from the feel that you're choosing to participate in in terms of engineering and I'm using that in the broadest sense of the word is fundamental to the way in which we will interact with the natural world and with each other in the future. You just drive around here go around the world you'll see that interesting thing about it is that this technological revolution that is pretty much impacted every feel from healthcare to transportation to how I do my banking to you know online dating to every field you can possibly think of has not really had much of an impact when it comes to conservation. I've been kind of like only two sort of scientific sort of breakthroughs that I can think of I can tell you what that is later but you know I just don't see that happen in my field yet what we're doing is fundamental life on a most fundamental engineering problem that you can really want to solve. So I think there's a huge scope and a huge opportunity opening for people who understand science people who understand engineering to apply that to problems that have to do with the natural world. I'll give you one tiny I mean I gave you that example of the sort of you might not think a mobile butcher shop is what you want to design somewhere along your way believe me it was amazing what. We came up with over there but I'll give you a different kind of project right so Philippine Philippines the coast of Philippines was kind of wiped out by a huge typhoon that came through on high and in three years ago. We went down there with engineers from back to health. We had a bird tell a very company huge engineering I think the second large engineering company the world when we talked to the community about. What we could do to prevent that happening again and having this devastating impact on the coastline and the engineers wanted to build some form of sea wall some kind of structure engineered solution to stopping a huge way. The conservationist we just wanted to plant mangroves and coral. So we were the impact then we talked to the community and said how big with the way they pointed at the top of the palm tree and both side that tell guys and our scientists realized that neither of our solutions would work because at that high no engineered hard structure would have solved what was actually coming. So what they came up with is a hybrid design that has some hard engineered points but also has 400 meters of mangroves that have been restored and a coral reef offshore and working with scientists from MIT in this case but we could have done it with Stanford as well with the engineering story. So we worked with the students at MIT to really model this out and they came up with this solution that would actually serve the needs of that community but also provide lots of service. That's the future and that green grain infrastructure and that design I think is what will ultimately save the coastline. It was interesting about that story is that it also required engineers from lots of different disciplines to work together right this was not just the mechanical engineer they needed to have people who who understood all sorts of other aspects of the environment to be able to solve that problem. Yeah, did you want to add something? Now I think the other component was that this was these potential solvers of the problem were convened by an organization that was bent on conservation internet that conservation international organized this unification of different disciplines. And that's part of the morality of our work is that we're not just focused on what's happening in our own backyard but we understand that what happens halfway around the world has a great influence on us. And that we can't just work in our own backyard we can't just solve the nearest problems we have to be available to bring whatever resources we have to to rest the world. And it's also interesting is that you work so closely with so many other organizations right this is it sounds as though you are supporting other people who have problems that they've identified and solutions that they want to implement. What are the sizes of those other organizations are these lots of small grassroots organizations that come to you and say hey can you give me a few thousand dollars or these you know really big organizations so paint a picture of the type of groups that you work with to actually implement these organizations. Sure, the last year our budget was about a hundred sixty million dollars which about forty million went straight out to partners. So we take partnerships very seriously we feel like it's the best way we can increase our impact without growing our organization we don't really have a desire to make CI bigger we have a huge desire to make our impact you know tenx. And so the way to do that is to partnership those partners can literally range from an indigenous community working on one problem around fisheries for example involves a dozen people to the government like literally working with the state government or with another conservation organization much bigger than us or the well bank so it can really sort of span that spectrum we have probably about 600 partners that we work with. They have to tomorrow Harrison and a few others will sign a big partnership agreement with NASA on some tools that we're creating about predictive tools that will help us map out degradation of land around the world at a like 250 meter resolution which is pretty good to get global coverage on so the partnerships can range and the great thing about see and it's fun because one day you're literally talking to one community in one village and the next day you're engaging with the community. So we're engaging with you know a university or a Beijing Academy of Sciences or a national government. We found that the best solutions are replicable they can they can they can be tested in one place and refined in one place but then they can be replicated in other areas where the problem is the same. Is the will the same group replicated or do you say okay let's write up a little case study and then have another group take it to their region. I think what I'm talking about is refining the process understanding the elements that lead to the problem and finding a ways to a solution and replicating it that in another place. I admit that we're not that great at writing those things up so you know in some ways we are a secret that and that doesn't need to be a secret. We've done well with some things but I think the sort of the need to solve the next thing doesn't allow us often the time and the opportunity which is really important to reflect on it and be able to you know case study it in a way that spread. Great. You know look I think this question of external externalities is a big one and in some cases we are able to do that. I'm not using pollution specifically but in things like the use of water or what happens to the product after someone buys it right some time ago we we got convinced by company that you know the possibility of something whatever we buy is our responsibility and not theirs. You know that have you guys seen that like famous like you know crying Indian commercial that you always see on earth day. Have you watched this this is like like embedded in people I think in the 70 in our generation. Go watch this it's like that it was like this commercial that basic it's basically a Native American who actually turns out to be actually I don't think he was actually a Native American. I think it was like an Italian actor but he's going down this river and he sees pollution he starts crying and it convinced a lot of America to pick up litter right it was the big first littering anti littering movement and to be honest literally pretty pretty low in this country compared to lots of other parts of the world that that often place like on earth day that was paid for again the bottle that was actually I'm actually know who's doing this. That was paid for by the American beverage industry. It was very clever they did it because I think they wanted to shift the owners of responsibility from people who are selling it the people who are buying. They got all of a suckers to read say this is our problem we got to deal with it. Interesting so you just started at conservation international not too long ago and I've took the helm only a few months ago you've been there 30 years let's flash forward 20 years what's the organization it'll look like what are the what are the metrics you hit what is success look like 20 years down the line. Well 20 years down the line I will no longer be involved with this organization but there's a good chance that's on the mic so I'll let you answer that question. You haven't seen Blade Runner or any of those you might be involved no okay 20 years from now look I hope that more of you are engaged with us. I hope that we have turned the tide on this deafening that we hear sometimes from leaders in terms of just not wanting to either believe the data or believe the time we've sort of got beyond that point I truly believe that will be in a place where you know incentives technology incentives and. Valuation of nature will be built into the way we do our work. It's really hard to predict what 20 years away I think of five years I can sort of see that I honestly I promise you look. I'm just going to name drop for a second here but I was recently with Gordon more was a founding board member at the I great friend of Harrison. And Gordon you know I asked them like did you ever see all of this stuff that we can do with the chip and he said no we didn't when the furthest we got with my son and I would walk around the house and we'd point to things where we thought a chip could go in we'd be like the toaster we could put a chip in there. But all of this this whole ecosystem that was created which never in his mind according to him so I find it very difficult to sort of ask what is 20 years going to look like I will tell you something if we don't take care of some of these issues now by 20 years of cost of doing so to be too great really. The price of conservation never gets cheaper in the future this cheapest it's going to get today and we you and us are the first generation that actually knows what's coming around the corner. And so it really is in our own best interest to do something about. Okay so my last question to both of you is one I'd like to ask I'd like each of you to go back a couple of decades to visualize yourself when you were a student in school. And think about what you wish you knew when you were 20. I was a desperately poor student very very difficult time in my life. And I regret deeply that I didn't take advantage of the opportunity. This is what you might expect from your elders. But it's true I didn't really discover my utility in college towards the end of my college years I've and understand that I had a. What I what what moved me might be potentially useful to me I found a community in story telling and that's what. That's what eventually became my life's work. So that's a pretty short story. When I was 20 I was trying to convince my parents or fool them into thinking that I was in med school. When I had really no intention of going that route you know we when we were I grew up in West Africa and my parents encouraged my hobby which was a love for nature and being outdoors and following things around but they always saw it as a hobby. David Attenborough's original life on a series on like DHS tapes and I watch that whole thing and I would you know kind of say I want to do that and they'd say quite literally that's for white people in my language but that's what they would say. And you do find encouraging it as hobby and around the age of 20 I started realizing that there might be something that I could do productively to follow this passion that I was developing and kind of go into it all in. So it was a it was a really interesting time where I was like literally like taking classes just send those grades in and then just go do something else. What I would do differently if I could go back and do it again you know I would pick I pay a lot more attention to cards guarantee you that right that gets just amazing how level like I actually got out of like 20 something years of education I could do that today in like a year. I can't understand what I spend all my time doing right amazing so but here's something I would have done a little differently communications. So like kind of Harrison said I obviously he went about that in a very different and profound way being able to tell a story is a really important thing for an entrepreneur to have and if you see some of the people particularly around here who made these amazing changes and have convinced you you could do something that no one else could it's through that power of communication. I've taken it more formally I learned it just accidentally that would have been something I would have done more I would have probably gone harder into statistics because understanding it helps you understand the world in a very unique way and then I probably would have for those of the two things I would really lean in heavy on the stat side I would lean in very heavily on the calm side writing or speaking or whatever you take don't underestimate how powerful that is. Even maybe especially engineers. Thank you so much for sharing your stories with us this was really powerful.
