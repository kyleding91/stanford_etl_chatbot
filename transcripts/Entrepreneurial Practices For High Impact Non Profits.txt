 You were listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at edcorner.stanford.edu. So I'm pleased to introduce both of our speakers today, Lily, who is falling asleep down here as a Basset Hound. And also, what is that dog's name? Zeeck. Zeeck and Lily. So welcome to you two, especially you two will dogs you. But you, I'm not calling you two dogs. In our world that's a coffee. That's right. So as I said before, I'm Professor Tom Biers and one of the hosts of the ETL series throughout the year. It's my special honor today to welcome a couple of people. First of all, on my right, your left is Michael Daring, who is going to be the interviewer today. And that's been our format lately, as you've noticed, for those of you who've been coming and those of you watching. Michael is an ex eBay executive, Brown executive. I mean, Brown graduate. But we're so blessed that lately he's been doing a good bit of teaching for us here at Stanford. The Design Institute or D-School, as well as the Stanford Technology Adventures program. He's currently teaching a class with Bob Sutton. And I love this name, innovation and complex organizations. So Michael, thanks for coming today and working with us. So he's going to be interviewing Christine. And Chris is the president of the Humane Society of Silicon Valley. I should say Chris Beninger, just the full name. So Chris is returning to campus. We got her MBA here, as you notice, from reading her bio. We also share the fact that when we got out of school a long, long time ago, she worked for Arthur Anderson, as I did as well. So that's pretty cool to see. And she spent many, many years, though, at Hewlett Packard, which is, you know, very dear to all of us here at Stanford, given that they were just two grad students. So Fred Turman, which is the building right next door. So there's a lot of connections between the two. I have to say that I had the pleasure of meeting Chris last year. And this fits exactly with what we're trying to accomplish with this seminar series that entrepreneurship can play a role in all kinds of things, not just websites. You know, it can play a role in life sciences, and it can play a role in green technologies. It can certainly play a role in what is now commonly referred to and is becoming very popular. Social innovations and social entrepreneurship. All of us have had the concept of a humane society in our heads since we probably were young kids and had our own pets. But isn't it interesting as we celebrate entrepreneurs who revolutionize entire industries like last week speaker when, you know, talking about his early days and founding price line to meet some people who are doing this in social innovation. So that is why with a great pride, I welcome Chris the campus and I'll turn it over to Michael. Let's give him a round of applause. Tell us how you got to the humane society Silicon Valley. It's not exactly the path I would have guessed if I looked at Stanford Business School, Hewlett Packard. You know, it was probably more by chance other than anything else. I was looking for HP. I had been there for 15 years. I managed a group of divisions, manufacturing divisions, traveled all over the world, actually loved my job. Had always had a passion for animals. Wasn't looking for a job at all. But was at work late one night and somebody had dropped off a Wall Street Journal at my desk and you know how you take a break and get a cup of coffee and you want to read a little bit of the paper and there was a big ad there for the executive director's position of Humane Society Silicon Valley and I thought, you know, I'll never get that job because I don't have a non-profit background but I'd sure love an interview because maybe that's something I'd like to do in another 10 years or 15 years and maybe I could take some classes. So I didn't even have a, didn't have a current resume but put together resume, put together cover letter, sent it out, didn't hear anything for four months, got a phone call to ask to come down and for an interview and I had to think, you know, I could, you've been so long, went down for a series of interviews and they ended up offering me the job and I accepted it on the spot without knowing really, really what the job entailed or what the salary was and have never looked back since. And what was it that led you to have the confidence to take that sharp left hand turn on the spot given you had the successful career in place and you were sort of succeeding in business, why take this sharp left hand turn? You know, a lot of my friends and colleagues said the same thing, you know, you're crazy. But you know, it was something that absolutely felt right and I had to explain the fact that I think I made the decision with the heart. It felt right in the gut and I'm a firm believer that when things feel right, go for it. And I did. And you know, what did I have to lose? I guess I could always go back into industry, right? So it's been a great journey. Tell the students if you would, I know a little bit about this but I'd love for you to share it. What was it like when you joined? What was the state of the organization? How were they doing? So when I joined, when I said I didn't really know much about the job, I really did not know much about the job. Like, the county had a contract with Humane Society to house their stray animals and that was a contract that provided 90% of our revenue stream and the county had just canceled that contract. We had about 300 donors. We had a board that didn't believe in fundraising because we didn't really want to go out to the world and sort of with a tin cup and bag. We fought with everybody in our community. We had no support from the vets, no support from city government. We had employees that were dealing drugs on site. We had employees that were sending animals to bunchers. The bunchers are people who collect animals and take them out for use in labs rather on scrupulous labs. So it was a bit of a cesspool, right? First started. It was quite interesting. And what was on the list of positives though? These guys. You know, so Lily, she wasn't there when I first got there. So what made it all worthwhile was the fact that we had this amazing mission which was to save and enhance lives. And it's not just literally about the four-legged lives, it's about the two-legged lives and the magic that happens when those two entities come together. So that's the saving grace is that the mission really carries you through the tough times. Indeed. I'm intrigued by the whole 90% of your revenue coming from a contract that was about to be canceled. Can you take the students back to the moment that you realized this was happening and kind of what your thoughts were at the time? Well, I probably can't exactly tell you my thoughts because you don't want it on tape. You know, you don't want to follow the words there. But you know, when you and I talk, you know, I think oftentimes when you're back is to the wall like that. That's probably when you start to become your most creative because you have no choice. You've got to do something. And that's where we made a strategic decision that to keep us afloat in the short term, we've got to jump right back into doing animal control and actually expand our reach in animal control where before we'd only been doing housing, we really need to, you know, be going out and bidding on, you know, contracts for also having the officers on the streets as well as just doing the housing. So it took us about six months but went out and we're able to garner contracts from nine different cities for animal control and housing. And that kept us afloat until we could kind of sort ourselves out. What were some of the other strategic changes that you had to make? That's a big one. What were some of the others that you faced at the time? Pretty much a complete turnover in management. So you know, my predecessor was one who had a lot of personal problems. So the organization had sort of been left to go its own way in a variety of different ways. So sometimes organizations attract the wrong people in those cases. So had to make a complete management change because there was so much distrust for our organization with the community. That also elicited concern from certain community members. So there was, you know, there was a lot of turmoil that first year in trying to get things settled out. People make all the difference in the world. You just, if you can get the right people within the organization, you know, sharing a common goal and a common mission, it's amazing what you can do. And that made all the difference. Yeah, same more about that. How did you find them? Find the right people and how did you glue them to the organization so that they would stick? Some of it was by luck. You know, you put ads out there and by the grace of God, somebody walks in your door who is absolutely amazing and shares the passion for you. I also brought a couple of my colleagues over from HP who I knew and trusted and could, you know, could work. We could work well together on, you know, moving forward with some of the changes that need to go forward. And what did you say to a successful career person at HP to say, come on and do this crazy thing with me? What was the pitch like? Well, you know, it's sharing the dream, you know, it's, you know, creating that vision not of what it is today, but of what it could be and the difference that somebody can really make. And I think that that's something that was very compelling to a number of people to think that it's like what I say, you know, when I work for Hewlett Packard, I never went home at night saying, wow, you know, we're so more computers today. But you're not kidding about that. Yeah, it's true. But now I go home at night saying, wow, you know, we found a home for crash who was an 11 year old, Collie Mix, who was with us for seven months and that is huge. That's absolutely huge. And this is the heart and you realize that you're saving lives one by one by one and, you know, people can feel good about that. There is this almost missionary sense around the team that at least the team I've met. And I wonder though, are there enough missionaries to fill all the spots you have and how do you keep the mercenaries from signing up for the hourly job just for the pay. I mean, how do you sort the sheets from the goats, the true believers from the sort of people who are just looking for a time card to punch. Well, you know, the mercenaries are pretty easy to sort out. Basically, you can sort of see how they react. I used to actually have my very first pass at how I adopted from the Humane Society was actually an epileptic. And it was always great doing an interview with Reben, the room, because she'd go into an epileptic fit. And it was interesting to see how people reacted. So if you screamed and ran out of the room, it's probably not the right place for you. But the harder part with our profession is sorting out those that are too passionate. Because passion is a double-edged sword. Is there such a thing? Yes, there is. Yes. How does that manifest? Because passion is an incredible thing. People who are passionate will do anything, you know, for the mission. But they will do anything for the mission. And passion is very personal. And with things are personal, people oftentimes don't want to compromise. So if I'm absolutely passionate that this is the right way to go, then teamwork goes out the door. People are more focused on undermining what's being done rather than working together as a team, which does require compromise to get something done. So in nonprofit work, it's important to find people who have that right balance. So let's go back to the strategic choices you made when you first took over. You lost the county contract. You built this network of city contracts and city relationships fast forward to maybe more like a year or two ago or bring us up to date on how the strategies evolved beyond that. So we put together a strategy to keep ourselves afloat, which we needed to do. Because if we weren't there, many, many, many more lives would be lost. But that strategy was not the right long-term strategy because merging animal control with humane work actually those two missions clash. So how so? So animal control's mission is to keep people safe from animals. And society's mission is basically to protect animals. So when you bring those two together, you get some unusual types of things happening, like small thing, but I would get phone calls from donors who would say, you know, your officer was just out at my house and I know have a hundred dollar ticket for my dog running at large. And I just, you know, I give you $10,000 last week. Could we just kind of call this even? And as an agent of the city, I can't do that. So now I've got a donor who's upset with me. If you're with animal control, you're focused on things like pet limits. So I'll put my hand in my heart and say, I'm over my pet limit. What is it? What is the pet limit? Every city says you can only have so many dogs and cats. So we won't talk about, you know, we won't talk about pet limits, Michael. Yeah. Yeah. I have three dogs and two cats. So I have two cats. You're all very limited. Humane society is really focused on, you know, good owners and the right matches. So some people can have three dogs and two cats and be fabulous. Other people shouldn't have an animal at all. So when you're trying to do both jobs, it puts you into some difficult dilemmas. And the other problem with animal control is you have the very, very difficult sort of city side of the job, the law enforcement side, which also manifests itself in difficult things. Our turnover rate at the time was 70%. It's really hard to do a job when 70% of your staff is turning over every year. So we critically looked at what we were doing, look at this clash of missions and said, you know, if really what our job is is to save and enhance lives, then that's where we need to focus. We need to get out of the animal control business and really focus on that saving and enhancing lives and we're closely with our animal control partners really have that collaborative relationship. If we do do that, we can really save more lives in Santa Clara County. Again, it was a little bit of a leap of faith because now, even though we built up our fundraising, our contracts were 60% of our revenue stream. So now we're giving them away. That happened over time. The good news is if you fast forward all of that, where are we from a community standpoint? We've gone from a community save rate of 30%. So what does that mean? That means that only three out of every 10 animals entering the Humane Society left the life to a community save rate within Santa Clara County now of 68%. At the Humane Society, we're approaching 90%. So with that strategic change, yes, we're now saving and enhancing more lives. We're reducing the number of animals coming into our facilities overall and the community is much more supportive of the work we do. And that strategy, I think, also allows you to pursue new ventures. It's not a for-profit, but a new venture in the form of things like regional rescue. Would you talk a little bit about regional rescue and why it's a good thing for your strategy? Sure. So when we talk about saving and enhancing lives, our role just isn't within the four walls of the Humane Society. We really look at that as a much broader role within Santa Clara County, within the state of California. And so as we have room, we actually go out to other organizations and take animals from them that would be usanized, either for space, because they're out of space and they can't stop the flow of animals coming in. Or those animals have either a medical or behavioral condition that's treatable, but they don't want to treat it. So Lily is a good example. Lily actually was part of our regional rescue program. She actually came from another shelter that was overcrowded. And she being six years old is not at the top of the list of an animal that you probably has high adoptability factor because of her age. So we're with our regional rescue program actually going out and sort of focusing on those individuals that the throwaways that nobody wants. And I think that these are the guys who make the biggest impact. It would be a shame not to have her spirit in this world. So it's a great program. If you take this direction that you put the HSS beyond where you're now you're walking away from your city contracts. You're going to full focus on the humane, the mission, the original mission of the Humane Society. What does it look like three, five, ten years out? Tell us about that. As we're now continuing to transition, then the next question is not only how do we continue to save more lives, but how do we really get to the core issues of what are driving animals into our shelters? And if you look at the core issues, the core issues have to do with regards to commitment to pets. So Lily for example is not an overpopulation problem. She came into a shelter as an adult. Her issue was a commitment problem. I'm actually her fourth owner. So she had three other owners who didn't want to commit to her and kept turning her into shelters. So how do we really deal with that core issue because it's not just about spaying and neutering anymore. And that's where we started to say, you know, the only way to do that is we've got to really change this paradigm of shelters away from being warehouses because that's what shelters traditionally are to being essentially involved in our community where we're really supporting that human animal bond to that's where the enhancement comes in over the life of the pet. So that people are, you know, really committing to their pets for a long term basis and not so they don't end up at the Humane Society. So we made the decision that our current facility, which is over 50 years old, does not really fit in with this new dynamic that we want to promote going forward. So we are in the process right now of building a new facility. The first of it's kind in the country. Very exciting. We call it an animal community center, not just a shelter. And what that will be is a combination of traditional Humane Society types of functions, which is adoption, education, spay neuter, with the enhancement of community outreach and services like doggy daycare, doggy cat boarding, a grooming center, a sports and training facility, a pet store, a cafe, dog parks. So what that means is on a Saturday morning, you know, you can come over to the Humane Society with Willie and your six year old. And you drop your six year old off at our amphitheater where we have the troop of Mary Nets from Happy Hollow Park in Zoo who comes over and does a Mary Nets show with an animal-based theme, but it's fun and interactive. For your six year old, you go out into the dog park where there's an exercise class going on where you and your dog exercise together, or maybe you do a yoga class together, or a dance class. But it's not just about training with your dog. It's, this is my best buddy, you know, we've got to go out and, you know, do something together. And then afterwards an hour later you meet at the cafe and you get a little something to eat and there's dog bakery there and you're, and Willie gets a little something too. So. And how does, how do you reach though the families, the three families that had Willie before you? How do you change their mind about this commitment? I mean, this is a, if this were a software company, we would be talking about how to modify customer behavior to make a bigger market, right? And this is, and this is, this is a fundamentally different domain, but same problem. How do you modify human behavior to create a bigger market so that there's a permanent home for Willie? So one of the big problems that we have in Santa Clara County and for anybody who's got a dog, you probably know there's very few places you can take your dog. Parks don't allow them. A lot of you go on, you know, even walking your animal down the street, a lot of people are like, whoa, you're not going to walk on the other side of the street. So creating a space, you know, I'm convinced that if her first owner had a place to come, where he or she could have, you know, done something fun with her, met other people who were like, minded and start to build sort of a social network around that, then probably that person would have been less likely to dump her because she then becomes a part of the family. But you know, the way to really change that behavior is we've got to get out there into the community. We've got to be a place that people want to come and really work with our community to provide, you know, fun and interactive things, not just a piece of paper when you walk in the door about, you know, how you take care of your pet. That's a real thing. Yeah, makes sense. One of the things I think is most interesting about your story and the context of HSV is, you've got sort of these two sides of your brain going. You've got the business executive which you trained every, you know, all your gigs before HSV were on that sort of executive track, that sort of private sector, for profit, big company, things. You've got the executive you and you've got the public policy you. And one of the things I think is most interesting about what you're describing is this willingness to be both the tough minded executive leader and the progressive public policy person. There's one area in particular that I'd love to talk about because I think the students will find it interesting is the Ferrell Cap problem in the Silicon Valley really struck me as at first kind of a, what are you talking about? And I can see how you got there and tell them about the catch, neuter, and release approach to managing Ferrell cats. So if part of our job is to really reduce the euthanasia of animals in Santa Clara County, if you look at what that euthanasia is, 80% of euthanasia that we do in our shelters is cats. And the vast majority of that are cats that have been homeless. So we have a huge homeless cat problem in Santa Clara County. We estimate that there's probably about 125,000 homeless cats in Santa Clara County. And you see them all the time. You see them behind the dumpsters. I'm sure people in neighborhoods you see feeding them, colonies, but cats are much more elusive than dogs are. So it's easy to ignore the problem. The other issue we have is that cats are second class citizens in our community. I can't tell you how many people I talk to who say, so you're killing all those cats. Well, that's a problem. We shouldn't be, you know, that is a problem when we're, you know, we could care less about death happening in huge numbers within our community. So there's this challenge around how do you deal with the problem and how do you get people to even care that it is a problem? So we first started with looking at, you know, how do you best solve the problem? And the solution to the problem is actually something that you wouldn't think. I mean, what you would probably think is, okay, worst case, we just go out and we use an I's 125,000 cats and now we don't have a problem anymore and we'll start from scratch. Well, it doesn't work that way because cats are such prolific breeders. You can obviously never catch all 125,000. They repopulate faster than you can actually catch them and kill them. And so that doesn't solve the problem. What solves the problem actually is a program called Catch Newtor release, which basically you trap the cat, you spay a newter it and you put it back in its colony and you let it live out its life as a spater-neuter animal. And those populations naturally then decline. But how do you get funding for that? Because people who are taking care of these cats don't want to pay $60, $70 a cat to spay a newter them. So we actually went to city government and got them to fund these programs by translating it into what it actually is costing the city to kill these cats. So to put it in perspective, to trap a cat, bring it into a humane society or bringing it into an animal control facility, actually cost the city between $20250. You can spay a newter a cat for $25 to $40. There's a lot cheaper to do it. And that actually sold the cities on funding these programs. With that funding over the last 10 years, we've been able to significantly bring down the excess populations. I understand there's actually one of the larger colonies of feral cats right here on campus. Yes. And actually one of the longest term, in terms of the volunteers that feed and take care of them and have actually made sure they've all been neutered or spayed. It's been going on since the late 70s and the colonies actually stabilized into your point is declining in population after a long time of increases. I think that's an interesting one, not only because of the analysis that you had to use to convince the cities to support you. That's analytics that you can do in any business situation to make a case to a potential customer or a source of capital. But I also think that the very, it's an unexpected solution because you're so trained to think, well, if they're wild or they're loose, you capture them and you take them in and they don't get to go back out. I think it's a really good example of the combo of hard-nosed analytics and creative progressive public policy that you guys use to address that particular problem. There's another thing you did speaking of cats that I'd love to talk about. You changed your pricing strategy for adoptions. Talk about that a little bit because I think that's another interesting thing that I've been in case of pattern recognition for those that are thinking about private, for-profit, entrepreneurial ventures versus social entrepreneurship. You're using similar analytics there to make a pricing decision. When I first started our adoption prices, I think we're $25 for a cat and $40 for a dog. Five years after I started the CVMA, the California Veterinary Medical Association, actually completed a study in looking at, basically, their study was around what types of animals get turned into shelters. But there was a little offshoot to that, which looked at how much people actually paid for the animal to begin with. And there was this correlation around the less that people paid for the animal, the more likely they are to turn it in because it's not worth as much. We made a strategic decision to raise our prices. Again, it was one of those outcries where board staff is going, oh my God, you can't raise prices. Who's going to pay more for a six-year-old dog? The whole concept is that if people pay more, they believe they're getting a better product. It's interesting. And they're much more likely to keep that product. We also made this strategic decision to say we're not going to continue to sanction that message that's being sent, that cats are not as important as dogs so that you pay less for cats and more for dogs. So the first year of sort of out of the shoot, we raised our prices from $25.40 to $110 for both the dog and a cat. And what was amazing about the first year is that we had a 10% increase in the number of adoptions we did, and a 50% decrease in the returns of animals to the human society. So it really has played out that the more you pay, people think it's a better product and people want to come to you. So we've continued to sort of lead the way in Santa Clara County with the highest adoption prices in the county. That's a good one. We want to save time for your questions and thoughts if you have comments or questions for Chris, please speak up or raise your hand, I guess. And I have some questions saved up in case that you're shy. What questions do you guys have? Yeah. Chris, as you think about both, the young people here in the audience and those of us who love animals, who are looking for things to do with part of the message that has to be better talking to things that follow and cheers to develop the cause. Are there positions that might be on the slide? I think you're in the audience. Absolutely. Oh, sure. So the question was, you know, what sort of volunteer opportunities are there? And I'm assuming also paid opportunities. Do you want to have that? No, no. You do that if you want the volunteer opportunities for sure. And donation opportunities. And donation opportunities. But there are all kinds of volunteer opportunities at the Humane Study. I think the one that I'd love to talk a little bit about that is absolutely critical to us, our socializers. So all of our animals stay until we can find them at home. So that may be two weeks. It may be seven months. So what's really important is that these guys maintain their social skills, that these guys are loved and handled every single day. So your job as a socializer is to come to the Humane Society and love. I mean, how hard is that? Right? It's great. I mean, it's really good for you. But we have volunteers that clean kennels. We have volunteers that work events. We have volunteers that stuff envelopes. We have volunteers who do analytical studies for us. I mean, we have basically someone right now who's doing some work with us around traffic into the Humane Society and really understanding who's coming through the door, who's leaving without a pet and why. We're actually, we're just applied to Stanford to the ACT program to look at having somebody analyze the homeschooling market for us. I think with our new facility, there's a requirement in the state of California that every child has humane education. So I think we're the perfect candidate for that, particularly for those individuals who are being homeschooled. So sort of explore that. So there's just almost anything. You can do my job. You can do my. And no contribution is too small. And no contribution is too small. Actually we get, I think the ones that touch my heart the most are the little low ladies who will send in five dollars and say, you know, that's basically, they apologize to me, that's all they can do. But to me, that's an amazing contribution because you know that they're giving something up in order to make that contribution. So yeah. So for the past several months, I attended the hall also, the meetings where they're talking about dog parks and beach walls. And so the severe shortage of dog parks, and I believe in the hall also the lowest that if they cannot have a dog walk, they should pretty much move in. So I'm just wondering if even you or the community that you have around me and just us be involved in actually, in these policy issues or getting the cities to actually be more pet friendly. We do, we do. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry, I'm sorry Tom. So the question is around whether the Humane Society gets involved with cities in helping to make those cities more pet friendly. And we do. We absolutely do. The interesting, the very interesting thing about city government is that they hate, they absolutely hate to deal with any type of animal ordinances because of the passion that happens. The city council meetings usually turn into big circuses. So it's very difficult actually to get an ordinance change even brought before city council. But it's a lot of work. And again, when you've got a small organization and everybody's working three jobs as it is, but we try and do as much as we can to make cities more pet friendly. Yeah. In scholarship and in entrepreneurship, I often hear people talk about time management, but it seems that ideally time management would follow for proper passion management. You talked about interviewing people and identifying them as two passionate, we're not passionate enough, but it seems to me that passion is something that's dynamic. And I wonder whether you have any similar pieces of advice or how to manage your own passion enough from overwhelmed by your work and how to manage the passion of your employees. So the question is whether I have any advice about how to manage my own passion and the passion of our employees or volunteers, our donors, our board. It's very difficult. I think it absolutely starts with the person initially. Each one of us, I will tell you, each one of us working in this environment because it's a life and death environment, there's going to be something that is going to trigger us. And what helps a lot is having a good strong team that works well with one another. So when I just completely lose it with Beth, that we have a good enough relationship to sit down with them and say I'm really sorry. It was just too much today. But it absolutely has to start with someone with an individual who is a team player, is willing to be balanced. The person that does not work well in our environment is someone who says, I absolutely love animals. I think they're much better than people. Well a lot of us really believe that. You have to have strong people, because that's really the hard part of the job in dealing with that. It's really important to walk away from the job. Our organization is 24-7. It runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. It's very easy. It's very easy to work 7 days a week, 15 hours a day. So it's really important that we police one another and say, you know, Beth, go home. It's time. It's time. It'll all be here tomorrow. You have to take care of one another a little bit because it can suck you in. One of the things I know the students have covered with other guests is the whole idea of raising money to support the venture. Talk a little bit about how you think about that problem because it's fundamentally different than the startup, the technology, for-profit sector that a lot of times they hear about. Love to talk about capital and financial base. So one of the things that really scared me about the job when I took it was fundraising. I mean, I think that that's not something that culturally we feel comfortable in our community doing is asking somebody for money. It sort of reminds us of the, you know, the homeless person I'm asking for a quarter. What I found is that she really believes in something. It's not about asking for money. It's actually sharing an opportunity. We are incredibly reliant on our community. Either to support us through donations or to utilize our services. And you know, it's really about getting your message out there, really believing in what you're doing, not being afraid to help share, giving other people an opportunity to make a difference in the community. You get turned down, but more times than not you don't. And people love being a part of what we're doing. So just to be clear, how do you pay the bills? What's the business model of HSSV? So the business model of HSSV right now is 60% of our revenue stream comes from donations, community donations, 40% from services. So the services are adoption, spay neuter. We have a pet store. We are always looking to sort of expand our service opportunities. And the new facility, one of the exciting things about that is we are expanding the services that we have. We're offering to our community and that will expand our revenue base and allow us to diversify our revenue base. So we're not as dependent on any one particular type of revenue stream. Our funding model is very heavily driven by our community donations. What is the breakdown of the donors? Is it mostly single family donations or pet food companies that donate a lot of money? So the question is what is the breakdown of our donor profile? Is it more corporate foundation driven or is it more individual driven? The funding model and animal welfare is very different than the funding model and say other types of social services. So our funding model is about 80% individual donations and 20% from foundations, grants, corporations, sort of thing. In other types of social services, it's almost exactly the opposite that you're getting government grants, foundations. And a very small portion comes from the individual. Some curious questions? What kind of screening process do you go through when somebody comes in and says, come on, adopt the offer? That's a great question. So the question is what's the screening process that we go through when people want to adopt a dog or a cat? So that is a change that we've made as well. Traditionally, human society have taken the approach that every single person coming through the door is going to be killing an animal. They're going to be horrible. And we just have to make certain that we really ferret these people out. Well, again, in looking at the types of people coming through our doors, honestly, 97% of every single person walking through the door is going to make a great pet owner. So it's not about, are you a good person or a bad person? It's about, let's get the right match for you. So that's what we focus on. And you're a single mother who has two children under the age of five and you're coming in wanting a puppy? Not a good match. So maybe what you really want is that seven-year-old lab who's great with kids, who's real calm, that's probably the better match for you. So our staff does not focus on, are you good or bad? They focus on, how do we find the right animal that's really going to be successful in your household? That's a great question. Other questions? Well, maybe I'll just take a minute or two and wrap up. And first of all, thanks to the students for attending. And Chris, thank you for coming. What I took away was there is a ton of overlap and pattern recognition between the small company private sector stuff that occupies a lot of our time and attention and the social entrepreneurship that you're engaging in at HSSV. Personally, I've had a front row seat to a lot of what you've done and I really, I got to tell you this is a fantastic executive and a fantastic organization. So I'm really glad you got to see that side of management and leadership, entrepreneurial management leadership, which is just right down the street here in Silicon Valley. I think a couple of things struck me. One is your commitment to strategic thinking and planning that there's actually, so you've got the values, you've got a purpose. What is the product line, service line, target customer, infrastructure that's going to make our mission possible? And I just think that thread is incredibly valuable. The second is I think analytically to be in an organization that has a social mission, but that relies heavily on analytics and careful, you know, left brain thinking is really a powerful lesson that, you know, I certainly didn't expect it until I got to know you and the organization. Third, I think that you have demonstrated in both your comments today and how you've run the organization that you've got this full set of tools, right? A lot of times you think social entrepreneurship means I've got a public policy lever and I might have a little bit of fundraising lever, but you've actually expanded the, you've got a set of dials and levers for managing that include pricing, you know, market research, strategic partnerships. And I think that's an important takeaway too, is that social entrepreneurial leadership also has this full dashboard of tools and resources that you can put to work against it. And it's just a terrific lesson for all of us who might not understand that. So thank you for coming. Really great, really terrific. Thank you. Thank you.
