 You were listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at edcorner.stanford.edu. Thanks Tom and good afternoon everyone. It's great to see you especially when it's such a gorgeous day outside. So it is wonderful to be here again for the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader seminar, particularly during Entrepreneurship Week. And I am absolutely delighted to share the stage with three dynamic and inspiring entrepreneurs. Jay Cohen Gilbert, Bart Hula-Hann and Andrew Kosoi, who you have full written bios of, are perhaps the most dynamic and exciting social entrepreneurs that I have worked with. And I have actually worked with a very wide range of social entrepreneurs around the world. They became friends as Stanford undergrads back in the late 80s. And after graduating, they all took respectable mainstream jobs. Jay was a management consultant at McKinsey. Bart went into investment banking, initially at Stonebridge Associates. Andrew went into private equity at Credit Swiss First Boston. So for those of you who are thinking about what you're going to do, these guys all initially took a pretty mainstream path. Jay was the first to get bit by the startup bug. And in the early 90s, he co-founded and won a basketball footwear and apparel company. He was initially in charge of product and marketing there and then became the CEO of that company. Around 94, he managed to talk Bart into leaving the investment banking world and joining him at And One. And Bart played a number of roles during his career there in finance and operations as CFO, COO, and president of And One. And in 2005, they sold the company. Andrew continued in the private equity world for 16 years and a variety of firms, most recently as a partner at MSD Real Estate Capital, which is an affiliate of Michael Dell's $12 billion investment vehicle. So I think you get a sense from their backgrounds that first of all, they have all acquired very significant business skills. They've also attained more than modest financial success while they're still relatively young, at least by my standards. And now they've decided to become social entrepreneurs for going far more lucrative career opportunities that any one of them could pursue to self fund the initial start-up of B-Lab and B-Corporation that we're going to learn a lot more about here over the next several minutes. This is, in my view, a very bold play. It's really kind of a swing for the fence. And arguably pretty risky. But I think one of the very exciting things that's going on in the social venture space. So let's now find out exactly what they're up to. So I'm going to start with you, Jay. Why don't you tell us a little bit about what B-Corporation is? I've been counseled to be as brief as possible. So here's my briefest answer for, and you can't laugh, Chris. B-Corporations are a new type of corporation that use the power of business to create public benefit. OK, say a little bit more. I want a little bit more. And the way you would know a B-Corporation when you saw one is you'd know it by three characteristics. The first is, has to do with standards. And that B-Corporations meet a set of comprehensive and transparent social environmental performance standards. The second has to do with their legal structure, which reflects the intentions of these purpose driven entrepreneurs and social investors, which is they've actually amended their articles of incorporation to expand the responsibilities of their corporation to include consideration of the interests of not only their shareholders, but also their employees, suppliers, community and environment. And the third way you'd be able to tell to B-Corporation is to get a nifty little logo. That is a B-Corporation logo. And so you've seen like a C-Corporate and S-Corporate. So this is a, these are B-Corporations. And so those, that B-Corpor logo you would see on consumer products companies, technology companies, financial intermediaries. And today they're about just over 80 B-Corporations that collectively represent about a $650 million marketplace. Great. So Bart, we've seen a lot of other standards and consumer labeling efforts up to this point. Things like fair trade and energy star and the GRI. So what's different about this? Sure. It's different in two very important ways. The first is most of those certifications are very stovepipe focused. They're either product specific or process specific. Whereas B-Corporation certification applies to the whole company. We're trying to measure a company's impact on its environment, its employees, its consumer set, its community and its leadership qualities. Those are the five things we're trying to measure. So first and foremost, whole company rather than individual product or practice. Second important element is as Jay mentioned, there's three different components that make a B-Corporation. The first, what I just mentioned, is standards or performance. But we're trying to drive more than just performance to this community. We're also talking about accountability and transparency. And the accountability side, Jay had mentioned something about our legal framework. It's really kind of cool. We have found a way to expand the responsibilities of corporations to include more than just shareholders. That in their day to day operations, an organization must take into consideration a broader set. That same group I mentioned before, employees, community, environment. That element is entirely different than any other certification component out of it because it's applying accountability. Not only do you need to meet those standards. You also can be held accountable to those standards. The third component is transparency. On the back end of becoming a B-Corporation, you actually make available to the public exactly how you did. Identifying not only where you excelled, but also where you were relatively weak. So those are the three elements, transparency, accountability, performance. Great. So Andrew, you guys are all pretty successful, experienced, talented business guys. There are good looking. I left out good looking. There are lots of things you could be doing now career-wise. Why are you doing this? Well, let me say, first of all, I feel like after that intro that we should all be like getting up and dancing a jig or something to do, to be as charismatic and exciting and dynamic as you've made us sound, particularly when what we're doing is sort of an infrastructure play, which is not the most sexy and exciting thing in the world to do. I think to answer your question, I guess a couple of things. I mean, the three of us have known each other for over 20 years at this point. I think discovered a pretty common set of values and views about social justice and social progress over not an insignificant number of years at what used to be called the coffee house. I don't even know if it still is when we were students here. But we've also had very different experiences since then in the private sector. So I think we've kind of come to this in different ways. So maybe I can talk about it from both a macro social justice point of view and also a much more personal one. And the personal one, I think, each of the three of us could probably answer very differently. For me, I wanted to, after working in the private equity industry in the mainstream world of the capital markets, I wanted to figure out a way to have a life that was much more consistent with my values where my work and my consumption and my investment and my philanthropy decisions could all be thought about in a consistent whole. And at least I found it very difficult in the capital markets to live like that. I found that the more successful I was or the more possibility of financial success, the harder it was to do that, not the easier. And the second thing is sort of from a maybe a more big picture perspective. I grew up believing very strongly in the power of the American dream as an idea that could propel great social progress. And in service, public service as sort of the highest calling, which I always thought about as politics and public policy. So I had a very narrow view. And over the course of a number of years of being in the private sector, I had some aha moments, which I think a lot of other people would call no duh moments. And so just let me list them really quickly because they get at a lot of why collectively we decided that creating B-lab and the concept of a B-corporation essentially a responsible and recognizable business and marketplace made sense. The first sort of aha for me was the idea that we're living in a pretty schizophrenic society that on one hand, it's a Stanford is a great microcosm of this. On one hand, it's all about innovation and speed and globalization and wealth creation. On the other hand, people are very desperate, I think, to have more meaning and purpose in their lives and more control over what goes on in a rapidly accelerating society. So there's this kind of need to reconcile, suggest, success and significance and sense of interdependence. And that, I think, kind of the recognition of that, at least for me, led to a question of how to be more engaged in social progress and spending a lot of time around social entrepreneurs, which has primarily been recognized as a non-profit movement up until now. The idea of innovation as a different way of driving the non-profit sector in the face of sort of stove-pipe society, where government, the private sector and the non-profit sector all kind of exist by themselves and there are big barriers between them. And in looking at that model, it started to become very clear to me that the private sector could actually be a much more powerful engine for social change than the non-profit or the government sector can be. And it's pretty easily seen in the relative size of the private sector. It's depending upon how you want to look at the numbers. It's 75 to 85 percent of economic activity in the US is private sector activity. And so if we're going to figure out a way to create social progress, that needs to come through, that needs to come through figuring out how to make the private sector work more effectively. And then having impact in the private sector requires a set of standards. And a different legal structure and a capital market that can allow capital to come to ideas that can be both profitable but also create positive social impact. And so as the three of us sort of started talking about some of those ideas, what became clear was that what we've ended up doing was the best way for the three of us to use our time. And by the way, bonus, getting to work with two of your best friends is a pretty nice way of getting up every morning to go to work. So that's why. It's a very long explanation. I apologize. Cool. It was a good one. So this all sounds conceptually pretty interesting. But is anybody really signing on? Jay, who are some of the founding B corporations? Right. So of the 80 or so that signed up in the first few months, there are a few names. I think people are probably more familiar with consumer products companies than other folks. So some of the consumer products companies you might have heard of, there's some Stanford grads, Eric Ryan and Adam Lowry that founded a company called Method. So for any of you that use the home care, personal care stuff, it's about a $100 million high growth consumer products company that does amazing, cradle to cradle design, environmental stewardship. There's another company called seventh generation that's in the same type of business also about the same size. There's a 200 year old company called King Arthur Flower. You all look like there's a lot of bakers in the world. I can tell. And so there's this 200 year old company out of Vermont that's 100% employee owned. They're a founding B corporation. And so you get, so those are some of the consumer products companies. Then there are other financial intermediaries. Some of them out here in the Bay Area, one's called Good Capital. That's doing very innovative stuff with their social enterprise fund. Another one called TBL Capital for a triple bottom line. And then a really cool small social venture fund called Agora Partnerships that's doing a social venture in Nicaragua. So there's financial intermediaries, there's consumer products companies, and then a host of stuff in between B2B businesses, technology companies, et cetera. From small, small, sole proprietorship to national brands, to global financial intermediaries. I think there's about, maybe I think out of the 80 companies or so, there's 17 different states represented across a couple dozen industries all told. So Bart, what do you think these founding B Corps hope to get out of this? I think there's a couple things. The first and most obvious is differentiation. Right now, I mean, everybody here in this audience knows that you can pick up any national magazine and you will find at least a half dozen ads with a big sun rising in the background or some gnarled hands holding soil falling between. And the truth is guys, we have no idea who's doing what right now. It's incredibly difficult to figure out who's green, who's charitable, who's responsible, who's sustainable. And the more we use the words, the less they meet. So the first thing is this allows an organization to clearly differentiate itself, to differentiate between a good company and just good marketing. Second element is that legal component that we were talking about. What the legal component allows a business to do is to make sure that mission that is so central to the organization, it's maintained over time. Because that legal framework can withstand new employees, it can withstand new management, it can withstand new investment dollars and it can even withstand a change of ownership. So you are, in fact, baking into the DNA of the business, this social mission. And if you talk to those entrepreneurs, that's incredibly critical to them. I mean, it's who they are, it's why they started their business and to be able to know that it's going to last over time and not be dependent upon that innovative, inspirational leader. That's really important to them. Third, we're developing a host of services. And we need to serve these companies and that ranges everything from shared platforms, whether it be distribution platforms or healthcare platforms. It'll include B2B community, at least folks are anxious to work with other mission-defined entrepreneurs. It'll even be direct services, whether it be consulting services. And perhaps last, but most importantly, what we hear from the entrepreneurs is they want to influence the market beyond their individual organization. If you ask them about why they're doing this, fundamentally they want to create a new model. And to date, they haven't been able to name it. They haven't been able to define it. And all of a sudden there's this umbrella brand that speaks to them, both on the performance and the accountability side, that really captures what they're looking for. So being able to influence a broader set of companies beyond their individual business. Interesting. And you might want to follow up on the, in terms of how these companies are influencing the market and what building this community does, not just for creating collective voice to help them differentiate themselves, but sort of what it paves the way for from a capital market to a policy standpoint might be useful. Right. I mean, I think a lot of, it is very hard for these kinds of, for mission-oriented businesses to grow rapidly, raise capital, even look at liquidity decisions in an environment where they know that both from a legal and a financial perspective, the pressure is going to be to, is going to be mostly on creating shareholder value as quickly as possible. And most mainstream, and we also, we live in a financial market environment where there's a tremendous amount of capital, but almost no one invests their own capital. Everyone is an intermediary for somebody else, layered upon, layer and layer. And as a result of that, most people act according to a relatively standard set of, of, quote, fiduciary duties, which are all put in the lens of maximizing shareholder value. And what that means is that for most companies that want to grow, they have a decision between, sort of, you know, selling their, selling their soul, if you will, or at least risking that, risking that someone is going to take control of their business and say, yeah, the mission says, that was nice, but let's focus on what's really important. And so, and so putting that sense of mission into the DNA of the business with the, with the legal work, and by having those standards, which create a comparable set of metrics across businesses in terms of social and environmental performance, then allows investors who care about those kinds of things to make decisions and put their capital where their, where their values are. And, and one thing that should be clear is this is, this stuff can sound sort of dreamy or hopeful sometimes when, you know, in the abstract, but it's important to recognize that there is a huge marketplace, or there's a huge market of existing activity. We're not kind of, we're not making this up. All we're doing really is trying to create some infrastructure that allows people to identify all of these kinds of businesses and allows capital to flow to these kinds of businesses so that they can grow into a more significant part of the economy. And so, you know, you have today in a $25 trillion equity market in the US, you have two and a half trillion dollars of capital, which already thinks about itself as socially responsible. Now, it's important to say that most of that is, is, is institutional money that screams out tobacco stocks or gambling stocks or essentially people doing what's called negative screening of synced stocks. But as a statement of intention, it's a statement that people want to invest their capital with some set of principles or values infused into the investment decision. And even if you back off of that huge number and just look at the $100 billion or so of direct impact oriented investing in microfinance or community venture capital funds and clean tech and things like that, you know, you get a strong sense. There is a lot of capital there, but the impediment to a lot of it is that lack of standards or that lack of sense of what you're actually getting in return for any kind of financial trade off you might be making as a social and environmental return. And so, the hope is that by building this infrastructure, both the legal and the standards that you then, you then have created a platform on which capital can more easily flow into the marketplace. So how many of you in this room have heard about B corporations before you came into this room today? Raise your hand. Okay, few of you. And you don't all work there. So the desire to differentiate, clearly a compelling goal, is somewhat dependent on people connecting with that little B. Jay, why don't you talk a little bit about how you're going to let the world know that this exists and build that awareness that then the founders and the new companies that join can take advantage of. That's a great question because there's been a host of attempts to do certifications schemes that have failed or even existing product specific ones are not often fairly well-known. And one of the things that sort of built into most of their business models is that it's fairly unscalable because the narrowness of their focus limits the market capacity for if all you're doing is certifying bananas, well then you might certify all the bananas in the world but it's still just bananas. Whereas B corporations can exist across every sector of the economy. And so the underlying business model, B Lab, the organization that we co-founded is a nonprofit organization because at the core of its standards body and we have to have our interest totally aligned with the marketplace and no sense of contrary interest. So we're a nonprofit but anybody that wants to be a B corporation, people can use the rating system, they can use the legal framework, all that stuff is up there on the web, totally available to anybody whether they want it, whether they care about us or not. But if they want to actually become a B corporation they pay a licensing fee. And that licensing fee is 10 basis points or one tenth of 1% of sales, a thousand bucks per million dollars in net sales. So if the 80 companies that are currently certified represent about a $650 million marketplace, that means within six months of sort of saying hello to the world, there's a $650,000 a year annual recurring revenue stream for the nonprofit to use, to continue to evolve the standards, do the auditing, work on the marketing and branding so that we can educate consumers, investors, policymakers about this and then to do some of the underlying work to help accelerate the marketplace with the services that BART talked about or developing more efficient capital markets or policy incentives than you talked about. And that model, that revenue model is amazingly leverageable when you think about the fact that as Andrew mentioned, there's a huge existing marketplace of companies already in the United States that self identify as sustainable or green or responsible or charitable or social enterprise. Conservatively, you know, there are between 20 and 30,000 businesses in the United States to today that we can look at their names and find their addresses and their in existing membership associations and they pay their dues. The issue is not, are they there or not, the issue is at factor fiction because there are no requirements other than do you pay your membership dues. And so with that, those 20, 30,000 businesses represent again conservatively a $40 or $50 billion marketplace. And to put that into context, take the revenues of every single major sports franchise in the United States, baseball, basketball, football, and we can even throw in hockey if you think it's a major sports franchise. Sorry, for anybody who's from like the North or something like that. And then you can throw an ESPN like on top of it. And that would only equal half the market presence of this existing marketplace of sustainable business and social enterprise. So if we're just able to look, again, sort of initially start by harnessing the energy that's already there, we're talking about a robust business model for this NGO, for BLAB, that will create tens of millions of dollars of operating surplus that we can then use to plow back into helping to build the infrastructure for the marketplace. And so the answer to the question of, I mean, I would be shocked if more than, I was shocked if four people even heard of it. That's where way ahead of the game. This is brand new. And the experience that we had at AN1 is marketing or branding is not an event. branding is a process. And it's actually a cumulative process. And so we are beginning the cumulative process of building this brand for good companies, called B-corporations. And so the different layers of that, all fed by, most importantly, it's fed by the community itself. And so if you've got $650 million brand out there today, that's just beginning to integrate those logos onto 7 million bags of flour and half a million catalogs and 30 painting trucks and whatever, 350 yard signs in suburban Philadelphia for Nolan Paine. All those little things are the things that you see as you go about and live your life. And you say, oh yeah, I've heard of that. I might have heard about it at the bank or I might have seen it at this restaurant or I might have seen it on this hang tag from this clothing or a parallel company. And all of that together begins to build critical mass. That's the first thing and basically that's free. That's basically the community itself saying we are now more than the sum of our parts. Beyond that is PR. And one thing that we did incredibly successfully and one, like so Bart and I built this company together with a lot of help from a ton of other people over a decade plus. And far and away the most successful stuff we did had nothing to do with the money we were spending. We knew that we were, Nike would, we could outspend us every day. And so we were going to beat them throughout spending them. But what we could do is we could create compelling stories that the press would pick up on. And so, you know, we got, like I think, 25 or 30 million dollars with the media coverage back at M1 when we signed LaTrell Spreewall. Maybe this might be like a way, bad reference for this particular audience. But that being said, and we ran an ad, we spent $75,000 to produce an ad. We ran it once during the NBA playoffs cost us $400,000. So for under $500,000 investment, we got $25 million with the media coverage, 60-minute story, New York Times magazine, et cetera. So because we figured out a story that was topical and that would sort of get sucked into a media story, the beauty of what's going on now in this space that Andrew is talking about and that Bart's talked about is we don't have to create media interest in things green or sustainable or responsible. The Hamed Unis won the Freakin' Nobel Peace Prize for crying out loud. You know, Bill Gates is being covered in the Wall Street Journal the day before he delivers his speech at Davos talking about creative capitalism. Like the wind is at our backs. Like we're in the last, just literally the last two or three years, everything has changed. And so we are just providing a story that's ready made to go into this current media hunger for, you know, I've been, if I have to see another green issue of some magazine, I'm going to throw up. And all the editors and reporters are saying the same thing, which is, well, everything can't be green. And so once you ask that question, or is it just about being green? What about people? And so once you ask those questions, we are a logical part of that story. And so we've gotten an inordinate and perhaps undeserved amount of press for where we are in our business cycle development. But it's all free. And literally every bit of that press is because we just answer the phone, hello, B-Lab, and they say, oh, hi, it's ink. We'd like to talk to you about doing a story. And so there's the co-branding effort. There's the PR. Those are the two primary things. And then, you know, we had reasonable success building a quarter billion dollar company creating an emotional connection with consumers around, you know, a brand for good ball players. And now we're just using those same tools to create a brand for good business. And one of the most exciting things on the more traditional thing is a partnership with Good Magazine. It's a very cool young magazine that hopefully you guys will check out to create potentially a new title called Good Business that becomes a voice sort of for, you know, for business people who give a damn. And that's an example of another type of marketing that's really about creating a vehicle to own a message, not just run a print ad or run a TV ad or figure out how to do a cool video that gets uploaded onto YouTube and spit out. But there's a way to how do we own a message and own a distribution channel for that message that becomes a, puts a megaphone up in front of all those tens of thousands of businesses and those 2.5 trillion dollars worth of investment capital. And we just create a frame around which to see them a little bit more clearly and a way for them to be heard with a little bit more amplification to their message. And they might have had if they were all doing it on their own. So I'm going to ask one more question on a slightly different track and then open it up to the audience. Job sharing doesn't really spring to mind as a winning approach for start-up CEOs. But one could argue that's essentially what the 3 of you are doing. There's no CEO of this venture. You have different and I think fabulously complementary backgrounds. But you really are sharing the leadership. So I'd like to throw out to all of you the question of what's that like? What's really hard about it? What's really good about it? I think most people in the Silicon Valley, most venture capitalists, if you said we're going to do a start-up and we're all 3 going to leave it together, they would have a less than positive reaction. So I think it's a really interesting aspect of what you're doing and I think it would be fun to hear you talk about it a little. See these scars? Exactly. We had a similar experience at Anne-Won where there were 3 of us that found to the company and a solid 5, 6 people that were really part of the key leadership team there. And so we come out of a decade plus experience of running a real team-based organization. And they're a handful of benefits. Far and away the most important benefit is they're all smarter than I am. And so you start with the recognition that you find people smarter than you and then you grab onto them and say don't leave. And that's a pretty good strategy because none of us are good enough to do this stuff on our own. And so the most important thing about the job sharing is just because it enables you to do more and do it better. The next most important thing, if you're lucky enough to do this with people that you love and that you respect, is that you can call each other out. And so there's nobody. When you guys fire away questions and I hope you're incredibly critical and et cetera, there is no way you can be as critical of us as we are of each other. And that I think comes out of the total trust that we have in each other and the recognition that we've all got relatively skilled and diverse sets of skills. And so for stuff to get out of our building and out into the world, it has to have already gone through a pretty aggressive little gauntlet. And I think that's incredibly powerful. And it's hard to do if you're just, I'm the man. And I got the idea. And so then you hire a bunch of people all lesser than you who are just saluting. And then hey, if you're right, God bless. But truth is, you're most likely going to be wrong way more than you're going to be right. And I think this is very, very good. I think the best way to do it is to not just keep the real people around, to bounce ideas off up and to check you and to check your own ego and your own, because often your instincts are incorrect. So I think those are the, it's all about the team. The experience today in one, we're trying to duplicate the some degree here at BLAM. The experience today in one was we had two founding principles. The team with the most superstars wins, and the best idea wins. in our seventh year when we created job titles. And at the time, we were probably about 72 million in revenues before we created job titles. And frankly, the reason we created job titles was because we had too many people who didn't understand what exactly we did. So we had to make sure they understood that we had a function at the organization. But I'm dead serious about it. It was, Jay's exactly right, that it's all about recognizing that you can't do it alone, that it always requires a team. And once you have that team, the humility to recognize that a best idea most likely won't come from this team. It's gonna come from some of our staff who's here in the audience. It's gonna come from outside the organization. And you gotta be great listeners. You just gotta be a great listener. You gotta listen to what your team's saying. You gotta listen to what your staff's saying. And in this particular venture, we gotta listen to what the community's saying. Because we're brand new to this space. We're brand new to social entrepreneurship, social enterprise. And there are people who've done this work for 35 years. And if you could look back two years ago to how this started and what our idea was two years ago and where it is now, it couldn't be more different. It couldn't be more different. And we hope, we hope, that's because we're good listeners. So I also worked in a series of organizations because they were private equity partnerships that in fact didn't have titles either other than a bunch of partners working together. But they were a bunch of partners working together that for the most part didn't like each other. All that much. And as a result, you had a lot of bad cultures and an environment as a result where either greed or ego or some combination generally was what won the day. And that's not all that functional. So I was very used to working in a partnership environment but not a very pleasant one. And so for me, what's been revelation is that you can actually do that in a different kind of environment. And particularly where it's built on respect and really importantly, I think trust and a common set of objectives, you can make that work pretty damn well. And I'm not an entrepreneur and I haven't been an operator in my previous career. I was an investor and I can't think of anything better than having partners who fill all of the holes in the experiences that I'm at and where I can add value the other way around. And as a result of that, we functioned I think pretty well without having titles. We kind of know, we have a pretty instinctive sense of who's gonna take control of what and who's gonna care more or be better at certain things. And I think the last thing is, there is a lot of checking of the ego at the door because in the end we will succeed or fail as a threesome or even as a larger organization not based on the celebrity or not based on the celebrity of one of us. Great, so let me open it up and here you go, jump right in. What was going to do is to be core standards in the other stages and you think it was slow down? Deborah, could you repeat the question? The question was, what would a startup have to do to live up to the B Corp standard in the early stages and would it likely slow down a startup? It's a great question. And we actually had a debate at the beginning as we were talking about startups. Specifically, whether somebody who was a startup could become a B Corporation, whether a pre-revenue company could actually receive certification. When fundamentally a component of that certification is performance. And at the end of the day what we decided is no performance has to be a component of it. And to that end, a startup must have an operating principle and operations that fulfills the needs of those performance requirements. That being said, what we're trying to provide is the toolkit for companies to start off as B Corporation rather than convert. You know, ideally you want people to incorporate this language at the get-go when they're doing their incorporation, that they look through the survey and understand what the principles are and the requirements on the performance standards so that they start operating in that manner at the get-go. We have lists of policies that we expect organizations to incorporate as they grow, as they go from one person to five people to 30 people to 30 plus. All of that is laid out on the website so that people can actually build into becoming a B Corporation. Now might be a good time to mention the URL of that website. Great idea. So sorry. To B Corporation dot net, that's the letter B and the word corporation also spelled out. You'll see basically the survey. And so you can click at it, everything's there. So you can see what the questions are and to your question. The survey is different depending upon the industry that you're in and depending on how many employees you have. And so there are fewer questions for a startup business than there are for $100 million business. And there are the weightings of all the questions that are different for a service business than for a manufacturing business. So when you complete the profile, it's going to give you a more intelligent set of answers so the requirements are effectively are slightly different depending upon where you are in your organizational development. And the quick and dirty thing for the second piece, which is the legal is A, don't incorporate as a Delaware C-Corp. So there's something on the agenda during our entrepreneur week that I noticed over at the business school that there's literally today, there's a panel for the JDMBA candidates on Delaware. Why is it so important? And the answer for why it's so important is it's the place with the most, it is the most shareholder friendly legal environment. So if you want to run a stakeholder friendly business, do not incorporate in Delaware. Even though that's where your attorney will tell you to go and that's where your accountant will tell you to go because that's where everybody goes. And everybody goes there because it has the best shareholder protective language. And so the recommended states are either New York or PA that both provide an underlying context that is more stakeholder friendly, but also will make your attorneys and your board more comfortable because they're real states with real legislative history and more predictable case law. PA, Pennsylvania, not Palo Alto for. Oh yeah, my bad. Thanks. OK, right here. We're going to wait for the microphones, which are coming quickly down the aisle. We have the two, so we're going to go back to the slide. That's good. So this question is kind of going a little bit back to fundamentals. But you guys self-identify as a social entrepreneur, starting a social enterprise. And we all know that it's a rather fuzzy term right now. So I was hoping that you could shed some light on both what it means to be a social entrepreneur and what it means to have a social enterprise and how that's different than a typical entrepreneurial venture or nonprofit. So in fairness, I think I identify them that way, but they can answer the question anyway. So I would say B corporations are is a term that's used to define a business. So you cannot be a B corporation if you are a nonprofit doing really cool things and you get in a show, a fellowship, or an echoing green fellowship, or something like that. So B corporations are specifically private enterprise for public benefit. The term social entrepreneur and even social enterprise, while, as Andrew said earlier, it's probably the history of that has probably come more out of the nonprofit sector, but is increasingly bled into the for-profit sector and sort of into the hybrid space, whatever that means. And so in general, we're trying to answer that question about what it is by not engaging in that debate and saying what is needed is something that is readily identifiable and what we're trying to speak to is people that have decided to use business as a tool for social change. And for those businesses that are trying to do that that have met these standards, they're called B corporations. And so that being said, from our point of view, our little worldview, I think that Bill Dreyton from Ashoka, we could probably agree that they would say that somebody who's saying they're creating a purpose-driven enterprise and they're doing some, applying the skill sets of an entrepreneur, of market discipline, sort of consumer or client feedback and accountability into the creation of and the continuous improvement and evolution of that enterprise, whether it's for-profit or nonprofit. So that's like the broadest, most nebulous frame. And we're trying to create focus around a piece of that, which is basically, you know, for-profit purpose-driven businesses. But the reason I refer to these three guys as social entrepreneurs is because in my definition, a social entrepreneur is someone who takes a very entrepreneurial approach to making a systemic change, not just putting on band-aids to deliver social value. And I think that's exactly what they're doing. That's it. That shares the answer was much better. OK, over here. So I'm a pretty simple-minded consumer. And I care about the world and the environment. Say I am able to find B corporations to satisfy every consumer need I have from the lumber to build my house to the food I eat to the paint on my car. What does that mean? Can I go to sleep a night, rest assured that my carbon footprint is zero, that my consumer dollars aren't going to polluting rivers and, you know, China next to factories that everyone's getting a living wage, wherever they're, you know, making my shoes. You should congratulate yourself on being the first B human. LAUGHTER So I think that what you can-you can go to sleep knowing that you're doing everything you can to minimize the harm that you're doing through your consumption and maximizing the benefit that you're creating through your active consumption. And it doesn't mean that it's going to be zero harm and it doesn't mean it's going to be ultimate benefit. But it just means among the choices that you have, you're making the choices, you've consciously opted in to make the choices with your consumption. If somebody else makes you the same thing about their investment portfolio, that are trying to maximize the social benefit through your participation in the marketplace. And one layer of that is just B corporations are not, which is really a certification. Sitting on top of the certification is actually a rating system. So think of it as an S&P rating system but for sustainability. And so on-whether you're a B corporation or not, it's sort of the binary inner out. But then whether you're one star, two star, three star, et cetera, then creates a way for you to say, okay, I want to actually now dial up the impact, the positive impact of what I'm doing. And you can do that either on an aggregate basis, or as you said, maybe you really care about the environment because you think Al Gore is just the greatest. And so you're going to say, I love B Corps, but I really want to focus on those B Corps that have five star environmental practices. Somebody else may say, that's all well and good, but even post the C levels rise and you're still going to be like 2.6 billion people living on less than a dollar a day. So I'm going to focus on community impact and global poverty. And you can find those B corporations, either as investments or consumer product decisions, that are using the power of business to address global poverty. So we've tried to create a flexible system in the B rating system to allow you to either A, do the kind of the very quick pass, what's the brand? It's got a swish on, it's a Nike, I'm an athlete. The equivalent of that is it's a B Corp, I know it's been checked, and I'm doing my bit. Just like there are people who want to go a little bit further than that. There'll be people in this community who want to go further and say, I don't want to target my investments or I'm going to target my consumption from maximum impact. And they're going to have to, you know, they can do all the cool search engine and figure out what the best one is there for their consumption or for their investment portfolio. Or you may be, maybe you're going to work for government. And you want to create a sustainable procurement initiative for the state of California, because you're going to be governed one day. You can't do that today because no one can define what's a sustainable business. And so back to the infrastructure play here, is this infrastructure that we're building, the marketplace that we're building for these companies, is not just relevant to you as a consumer or to you as an investor, it's also relevant to you as, you know, the future governor of a state, because now you can create a procurement preference or a tax incentive or an investment preference to favor these types of companies to further sort of put your foot on the accelerator, forgetting more capital and talent to flow into more beneficial activities. Like that's the ultimate objective of what we're doing. The specifics of the rating system and the legal framework, when there's 80 companies or 800 companies is all just getting to that critical mass where what we're actually doing is we're creating the tools to build a new sector of the economy. That is harnessing the power of business to create public benefit. And in 30 years time, that's what we'll see. So when your kids and your grandkids are lining up at the CPPC, if that still exists for jobs, the longest line should be at the B-Corp jobs. And when you put in your money for the IRA to have your kids go to, not the IRA, but you know, for your 529 or whatever to get your kids go to school, you can put it in a B fund so that, as Andrew said, you do as best a job as you can to get your stuff into alignment. And right now that's a lot harder than it ought to be. To make it clear that this stuff can come off as sounding like we think we're saving the world. And so the one thing I would say is those things are all great, but you know, there's still an incredibly broad group of problems out there that this won't solve that will always require the nonprofit sector and philanthropy and government. And things that consumption in the private sector just will never be able to fulfill. And individuals, whether it's through voting or other kinds of volunteer work. And I think also really importantly, through maybe just choosing to consume less, can also have a huge impact on a lot of social problems. That we won't be able to solve even if we're wildly successful with what we're trying to do. I'm going to say that. I've ignored this side of the room. Oh, I am going to continue to ignore this side of the room. I apologize. Okay, up here. Why the name B Corporation? I mean, if you're a company, why wouldn't you rather have your consumers look at you as say an A Corporation? Yeah, for good. Yeah, no doubt. So you've heard of C Corps and S Corps. You might not have heard of T Corps, which are cooperatives. So we basically had 23 letters to choose from. And the reason why we're picking letters is because ultimately what we want is formal legal recognition. This is all a path towards formal legal recognition for a new corporate form. And on the backs of that, tax incentives, procurement preferences, investment preferences, etc. And so we know that the IRS wants a letter. So we got to pick a letter. We got 23 to choose from. And the going, at least the going joke, and you can hear more if you want to come to the reception, is that B stands for the benefits that are created for all stakeholders, not just shareholders. So in a shorthand, these are beneficial corporations. So that's the reason for the B. Okay, everybody, join me and give them a round of applause. Thank you. Thank you.
