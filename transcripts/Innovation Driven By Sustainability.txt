 Who you are defines how you build. This is the entrepreneur thought leader series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. On today's episode we have Brad Bowe, co-founder and executive chairman of Lime, a smart bike share company. Before Lime, Brad co-founded Kinzen Capital and established and grew Tencent's US presence. Here's Brad. It's my pleasure to be here and really appreciate you taking the time today to listen to the story of Lime. So, today I want to go to you going to be sharing with you a little bit story and a journey of Lime, which is 21 months old company. Now, we're a really young company. But then the topic today is not about just Lime. The topic is about a lot of impassables. That impassable of a company can do well and do good at the same time. The impassable scenario of how a company can grow really fast, well that not crashing cities or due to face that the city's or committee doesn't want it. And I think the story is about can we reinvent the urban transportation? Can we build a step-by-step towards what a more than urban transportation will look like and can we fight against all the challenges we have, commonly in the city? So I think the, you know, notice that a lot of people have heard about Lime. There are not many that have tried it. I think it's due to availability issues that in the cities who are living or working, but we're working on that. So we're as assured on that. First of all, right, the micro-trans of urbanization, that is, you know, that is non-stoppable. And I think that trend is going to happen regardless what. And then the second part that comes with it is the traffic and the pollution that everyone experienced on a daily basis and some choose to ignore it. But it's happening. And I think that it was just getting worse and worse. And when we look at globally that, you know, in terms of the traffic and pollution so that the, in the past, the solution is to throw more car at it, right? Let's build a more road. Let's throw more cars at it. That doesn't solve the problem. You actually make it worse. I think I've been living in a, you know, Bay Area for about 15 years. I can clearly notice how the change, you know, has been happening over time. And many of the, you know, in the audience probably experienced the same. But then when we look at it, you know, what is the most efficient way to get a run for the first and last mile? If we look at the data shows that 70% of the traffic in the US is a single occupancy and also that, you know, 50% plus of them are less than a mile. And you put that two together. That do we really need to drive a seven-seater SUV to, you know, get a run, go to work or just buy groceries or even just grab a coffee. And the answer probably is no. And it's not about only just the causes, about pollution, it's about shared space, how we can utilize them. It's about the cost effectiveness. And it's also a matter of fact that about how we connect to the communities, how do we connect with each other, how we stay healthier, active, and more social. And, you know, for me, that something went wrong. I grew up in China and bike was a form of transportation for us to get a run. And, you know, not only in high school but also in college. And even when after I moved here, I still owns like, well, eight to nine different bikes I get a run anytime I could on a bike. And that's my form of transportation, right? And is that only two for China, which is known for the kingdom of bicycle? Then we look around the globe. That's UK, that's Amsterdam, that's Copenhagen, that's many other places. That's bike and alternative transportation is a norm of transportation. But why that is not a case in the US. If we look at Amsterdam and Copenhagen, they're definitely leading the trend with 30, 40% of the year transportation on our own bikes and alternative worlds of transportation. And in the US, the number is 1%. That 1% number, you know, then we got to ask ourselves, right? That is the weather here, worst than Amsterdam? Is the road here narrow than Amsterdam? And what is the reason? What does stop us from adopting more? Right, cars and cultures. And that's the only thing. It's not that we're, you know, there's no, you know, it's not, there's a real blocker from us to get there. Then it's really perceptions, cultures, cars and doing bracelet. And then we look at it, you know, what are the things that we can help users, how about community to get over the hurdle? Now, the way to convince them to use it or adopt it is not like say, you're doing a noble thing. Therefore, you have to put in, you know, twice as high the price and do twice as much effort to make it happen. The better way to convince people is to, when we provide you a service, a solution, that's faster and cheaper and more convenient. That is the way that we think this will generate massive behavior shift that really make it happen, right? Our goal is not about the 1% of bike traffic in the US, that how much market share we can get. Our goal is that how we push that 1%, 2%, 10%, 2%, 20%. You know, there we say 250% of the traffic. And that's the 50% of the traffic in the US city today, less than one mile and is single occupancy. There's no reason we cannot do that other than we're working together. So, we start in mind when we look at the market, right? That the first and last mile is, you know, from a business perspective, that if we want to have a business that's sustainable, that can really push for big vision and big goals. It has to have the economic foundation for it. So, we look at the market, is there a market? Is there, you know, big enough to support it? Or the R&D goes into it or the efforts or the team will go into it? And is there a market that, you know, that user are feeling that pain point on the daily basis? And that is the 300 million trip on the daily basis in the US that we're talking about. And just as a reference, that UBRIAN left doing about 10 million trips on a daily basis. And this is a market that we're looking at 30 acts bigger than that. So, when we get started, right, that we were caught many times where it was crazy was. And, you know, some would say, oh, this thing hasn't been tried before, right? Nobody used it. But is that really user, don't want to use it? Or is that a product design, the technology available at the time? Or the price in point doesn't make sense? And, you know, city bikes and a four bike, how many tried a four bike? Okay, how much you paid for it? It's $10 a day, right? You know, $9 or $10 a day in New York is a little bit more expensive. Why you walk a couple blocks, trying to take a bike out of the, out of the dock. And also you have to walk a couple blocks where you get there, return it and pay more than over. It just doesn't make sense. And that's on top of that. You, you, you probably also realize you paid for it already. So, it's just $50 million tax dollars to build that thing. And only in CBD area, right? If you're in a neighborhood, you're a good luck. You will never find one. And so, those are the things that is not, the user don't want it. It's the product at a time was not ready for a massive adoption. It's the design of the system for the convenience and the pricing point that is not there. So, when we started company, we focused on the three A's. I made it simple for my team. The accessibility, availability and affordability. If one of that is not there, we cannot expect a user willing to pay twice as a more expensive than a Uber ride in order to support it. That's just not logical. So, those are the three things we work on and to solve that problem. And the second part is that, oh, doesn't well, you know, the business model will never work that, you know, it will burn money like hell. But we validated that wrong too. I think for the, for the right product, right experience. And also the efficiency we provided to the users, that user more than happy to pay. So, you probably noticed a few things that, you know, there are a lot of social media posts about Lyme, right? That you probably see online on Twitter, on Instagrams, you know, on Facebook or not, right? You know, raise your hand if you saw a single user's that Lyme product is too expensive. There's just not. You know, that is the main thing saying that we delivered over 20 million trips ever since we launched the first market. Yet, you see one person say, Lyme is too expensive. And also, users are really embracing it by not only writing it, also sharing on all kinds of, you know, social media that the fund they have, the time they save, the efficiency that they generated, and also, you know, kind of like the memory they record as a cat or the, the problems of that they contribute to saving the traffic and then, and also, you know, they, you know, to reduce the pollution, right? What is the last time you saw someone jump on you in a Uber and take a selfie? Raise your hand. I think that's the difference. That we're providing the value, but also beyond that, we help the user to recognize in that also contributing to reducing the traffic and contributing to reducing the pollution. And that is what we proud of as a company. It's not only about Lyme, it's the movement we're generating, and the, it's the, you know, some of the perceptions, some of the culture, behaviors that we hope to push forward. And the third thing that, you know, the end of the tree on the trees, the end of the lake, it did happen. In different markets, we got, we found our bikes and scooters and of like all kinds of different things. But I think that's a challenge that there's always the small percentage of bad actors that will do crazy things. You know, should we be deterred from it? Should we punish the 99% by, you know, just owning the damage done by the 1%. We as a company that we think is the only right thing to do is to focus on the majority of the good actors, rather than punish everyone because of there's 1% bad actor out there. We all be punished by that, you know, a lot of system designed in the world is not about how do we give the 99% good actors the good, you know, the best experience and the most efficient and most valuable experience. It's designed to prevent that 1% and everyone else got punished. So data, I think it can be sold by technologies. We can further improve on that and that could be further solved by educations. I'll give you one example of that. We all went through the security check at the airport. Right, that the, I'm not saying we should take that as it's about get to get me wrong. But the reality is by being all the good actors, by participating in the program in order to ensure that we're all safe, we are punished by the potentially 1% of bad actor out there. It's necessary for us to ensure the safety and the security is out of that. But that means we line up every single one of us went through the security check, the back checks and take off your shoes, take the belt, we're all punished by that. So I think there are good reason for the system to be placed, but in our case that, you know, can we solve it by technology, by sensors, by detections, by self-user reports or that, rather than make it rather difficult to use. Just like the dog-based system. It's not a good user experience. It doesn't take you to a destination. If you cannot return to the dog, you got, you know, penalties. And by being a good actor. So then we look at what we do, right, that we as a company, we didn't start as a bike share company or scooter share company. We tried and tested all kinds of products and to fit in the different user cases. So we started with bike, we added e-bikes to it, and then we launched the scooters and now we're going to launch the shared cars and to accommodate the user cases, the user's needs. And this is the way that we see that, you know, we as a company, not a product company, but we're rather a user company that you provided what a user needed. And it always will be free-floating, take you end to end, and it also will be much cost-effective. So again, goes back to the three things that we focus on, very accessible and very available and also very affordable. And this is the way that, you know, we create a value for the users and convince them that, you know, this is the right thing to do, rather than, you know, way, can you spend twice as more in order to support it because we are a good company. They don't think that's a logical way to do business. And that, there you go, the three A's will focus on. And also that for the company, the mission for the company that I summarized three E's, I simplify everything so my team will easy to remember that, you know, my goal is that any company employee of Lyme, you will ask them the question. They will give you an answer immediately. So the three E's as our mission, in a mission statement is efficiency, eco-friendly, and also enjoyable. And we do the things that you make three things happen at the same time. And here is an animation of how we powered the city of Paris. You know, we not only connect the entire city together, this is the rendering of 16 hours. So we not only connecting them all together, but also that we cover a lot of neighborhoods are traditionally considered as transportation desert. There's no public service, you know, Uber driver doesn't want to go there and all kinds of things and same as many other cities we launched with. So we're not just a replacement of the cars that our user take, but also we're a complimentary system to the existing, you know, system. That in Paris alone, that we were powering over 30,000 trips on a daily basis. And the, and the phone factor is that we launched over 12 countries in a lot of three months. And you know, New Zealand is one of the market, very interesting. We're at store ranking number one in New Zealand. And it took us 24 hours together that without, without any marketing, literally we launched and we're number one and we stay number one ever since. So that's how user wanted, right, not by attracted to the marketing, but really by their daily need and daily demand. And out of the, out of the use cases that 34% of our users are using it to replace car trips that they would otherwise that are using a car, you know, either driving their own car or using a car service. And out of the 17% are replacing the public transit, but also this is not entirely a replacing. We also helped increasing the utilization on the public transit because we have the solution for the first and last mile, which is the biggest challenge for public transit. And 40% of our users end up or started from public transit. So it's a very complimentary to the system and 37% that use that to replace long walking. You know, this one is a little bit debatable. Is that really good thing or bad? But I would say that all users choose to use them that is to save time. And that time could be shifted to do other things like exercising. So it's a better option for the user to optimizing their daily work and the end also time. And then the other part of that is, you know, in terms of like the walking side for the business on the business side, right? This is a mark can never be monetized before. There's an entire blue ocean that, you know, never be monetized before is not because it cannot be monetized. It's there's no right product and business model to do that. But the last piece is a little bit controversial, right? Maybe when it comes to transportation, we're just lazy. We just want to get there instead of putting the work maybe that's, you know, not a right way to put it. But I think that the we are not here to determine how user lived a life. We're here to provide options for them to choose from. And that's the option that we choose we we provide it. It doesn't not prohibit user from walking, but it does provide the option even to want to get there faster. Right to me that you know, that's one of the things that I struggle on a daily basis, whether you sell for us go running between the meetings and come to the public transit. So we launched the first market in June last year and we're roughly about one year and four months ever since we launched the first market. And now we're in over 140 markets and as I mentioned that we're in 12 countries already and we're, you know, ranked really high in all the in all the almost all the countries we launched with. And this is based on zero marketing. So we don't even have a internal marketing team right and a lot of people ask me what is your cat right anyone in entrepreneurship that knows what cat is right. Okay, so what is the cost of acquisition and my answer is zero we don't have use acquisition cost. But I think that is the really focusing on the real world challenge that really focus on the value addings is the best user acquisition strategy. We are we generate over 20 million trips as I mentioned and we're generating and you know users and trips way faster than you know over or left or whoever it is in the past. And in terms of the revenues that we're probably one of the fast ever growing company in the history. So you can compare from the market launch to you know first 100 million 200 million 300 million revenues that's the projection that's what we got so far that's the project. Projection looks like again that this is on top of that we did a even spend marketing dollar to acquire users. The mission for the for life again that is not a back to your company not a share school company but a more a urban living you know platform if you would I think the when we come when it comes to technology how that will impact our life right there's always the left and right at the base on technologist adding values technologist taking away our social time technology is you know drawn us into the digital media. And forget about family and all that stuff and attention that are all we do is about online life right I'm proud of that experience learn a lot from it but for lineman for the things we're doing here is all about how we leverage technology to empower users real world life to make it better you know more connected well educated informed more efficient more enjoyable and more eco friendly. So we started with a transportation that you know you guess user from a to b but user go out for a reason right you don't go out just for go out you got to work you got to school to launch to dinner to meeting friends to bars to coffee to groceries and the next step for us is how do we help them to connect that piece you know in terms of the user be more informed be you know connected and also much more again more efficient and more enjoyable. And that will be the next chapter for line you know in terms of the product roadmap and this are just some of the photos from our users all of the place that you probably fan billions of them online. And when it comes to entrepreneurship that I that was the only slide I did so when I was okay I've got to speak here you know I want to one slide right and what is the slide will look like it that's the slide the slide is that okay what do we do sing differently. Well it's not necessarily different from every single other companies but you know different that we think that help us to really get so far where we at focus on the long term that determines how we make decisions and determines that how we do things that a little bit I won't say abnormal but we take always a harder path that we don't have things we don't take sure cause where company were brought up that we are. A company without shortcuts that you know building the scooter for example and also bikes that all the other companies just buy off the show product right literally you place the order you have Amazon prime tomorrow you have the scooter you can launch and it took us you know much longer time to build a custom build you know hardware that is long lasting. Actually safe and also that is more durable and it's good for the users good for the users and good for the city since we have more advanced sensor on it and we can you know detect the scooter fail over we can know where they are and we can make sure that the fleet is well maintained and also the better experience for the user that's much safer it's a much harder path that we took and we did it and you know when it comes to city all the wise devices we got at the time is it's not going to be a lot of things. Hey we've got a playbook right what are we just going and just dump millions of scooters on the street and you know we not market right argue about that later and we didn't really do that it's a harder path it took us six months to get at the first market you know a city agree upon that and it's give us the permit to launch that is another hat path hard path that we took and there are many examples like that that I think that you know when it focus on the long term that really help us to turn to decide what is the right thing to do. And to do the right things right that's what part of it and I think that is very critical for us or the matter of any companies right that you know how do we know what the things right or not many cases in many cases we know it's right or we know it's wrong. But if we don't look at it from a long term perspective you could be very tempting there are a lot of things are very tempting you look at a short term wise but long term wise that you know it's wrong so I think that is the one of the principles for the company what we make decisions that we always tended to to take the harder path tended to ignore some so called best practices out there is not because we're stubborn is that we focus on a long term and the second thing is to do the right things as I mentioned right we did a few out of things and for whoever that wrote of you know city bike and for the bike in the past or whatever bike rentals or school rental in the past you were never insured and that was a surprise come to us when I was in the research industry the whole industry has been run the bike industry has been run for about 200 years the bike rental business pass being run roughly about 200 years nobody insured users and we look at it legally no that's not required right therefore you know all the historical reason that that insurance is not required for bike rentals and and and the school right but is that right thing to do I don't think so so we were the first one actually bought insurance for our users to champion that in the entire industry now it becomes more and more standard for every single company that follows into it they should provide insurance you know do we occur more cost right we can't even find a underwriter you know when we talked to the insurance company they were like what are you talking about right no there's no such a thing in the history we never ride under ride a bike rental insurance it just never be required and nobody proactively provided and we did right we provided also cash payment for the non smartphone the non non banking users and not as shows we're not going to make a lot of money but that's the right thing to do and same as like you know why we further enhance our products where we added you know advanced safety features to it and those are the things that if we look at a short time it's not necessary help us in you know in a typical like fundraising things or that right but that's the right thing to do and that's what we did it and with the bracket under that we don't know all the time what is the right thing to do right we try we learn we're not going to be able to look at it we failed and we correct them. But at least one thing we know is what is the wrong thing to do or not to do. And one of that is if the vehicle is not safe, we shouldn't put on a street. Right? And we should correct any mistake that we found as soon as possible. So I think that is one of the guiding principles for at least for me as a person and hopefully for my team, till I go forward. And passion is another thing that I think that really matters. When it comes to entrepreneurship or that, you know, someone can follow what is the hardest trend and suffer ever since. Or someone can really follow their passion and enjoy ever since. I think entrepreneurship to me that is not measured by whether it's a fuzzy, you know, glamour, CEO or founder or that. Entrepreneurship is not measured by whether it's a billion dollar company or how much you earn from that is really measured by itself, you know, satisfaction. And also measured by the impact that each of the person, each of the company, each of the role in the team that that made. And that to me that really matters a lot. And that's what we believe in as well. And then emerged with great people. And that I benefited a ton of. I think the life is a learning process. Life is a journey of absorbing good things that get rid of the bad things. And that I learned a lot. You know, be at the right place and working in the industries or stuff that you passion on. And also just be immersed with great people. It's something that I think is very helpful when it comes to entrepreneurship. And entrepreneurs that at one character, if you know or maybe you guessed, it's actually very lonely. That you're by yourself in many cases. There are tough decisions. There are tough times that even sometimes investors not fully align with you. Right? Some of the team is not, you know, necessary agree upon. So the lonely moment that, you know, and there are always key decisions to be made. And in those cases, that the great mentors that I had in the past that I learned from, that the great mentors that gave me, you know, the guiding principles. Nobody can tell everyone how to live their life. But a group, there are a lot of the principles that we've done so far. So we, I benefit a lot from that. And I think that that's one of the suggestions. I would give. If anyone asks me that, what are the things that are devices I would give? And that's one of my devices to a young entrepreneur or whoever it is. And I would post there to take any, you know, to take any questions that you might have. Thank you. I have two questions. One is, how do you think about your competitors when you're competitive with managers? The second is, um, about your marketing department. Do you, building marketing environments kind of low, pain through, or do you need to just operate in any city and just put in the new, like, and whatnot? Is that the better? Yeah, so the question, there are two questions. The first question is, how do we view the competitors? And the second question is that, you know, whether building a marketing team is a low-handing fruit, or, uh, the, just put the scooters and bikes into cities is a better marketing strategy, right? Is it? Okay, so first on the competitor side, we just had an all-hands meeting that I shared with the team. And then, you know, the, the thesis for that, uh, or the theme that I put on the wall is, never drive drive by only look at rear-view mirror. That, that's how we take it like that. I think the, you know, we always pick into the rear-view mirror and look at what's around us, what's behind us, and all that, but we should never drive just by looking at the rear-view mirror. So if you look at that, us versus the our competitors, yeah, we are competitive and market is a dynamic, but we never make decision based on that. So that's the my view on that. And I think again, goes back to here is that we focus on what is right or what's wrong. You know, in, in the competitive world, I, one of the example is, when we are all supply and constraint, as we are today, the easy low-handing fruit or the things we should do is we buy the cheapest device that put out there, right? And then, you know, put as many as possible, but we did, we deliberately didn't do that. We spent six months to design the first generation, and then we either rated on monthly cadence. So in the last course of like 11, 12 months or so, that we have seven or eight different iterations on the scooter alone, and we have, you know, four major red wraps of the scooter. It does slow us down in terms of deploying to the market. It does cost more in terms of R&D costs, but we believe that's the only right thing to do. And when we look at a longer term, right, I think the analogy, you know, here there is, back in the 1990s, that there are like thousands of all e-commerce sites. And guess how many left now, right? That the long term wheel will determine a company whether it has the right improvements and the right foundations that in the longer term. I think in the short term, when you look at it, it's very competitive. But if we take a longer term view, I don't think that the competitors, you know, first matter them much. But second matter, I think that the all competitive advantage mostly is worth doing the right things and user will recognize them. User and customers are the smartest group of people in the world. You know, anyone trying to trick them, anyone trying to take advantage of them will fail. They might fold them once or twice to begin with, but they will fail. And that is something that, you know, when we look at the decision-making, that we mostly, the term, I don't even invent it, but I, you know, reuse it for our internal meetings is 20 mile march. The 20 mile march is what we wanted to achieve and how we step as step, build a company, build a product, build a services towards that. And so, you know, in terms of competition, I think that the, or in the market is such a, you know, new greenfield, everyone will grow. When only in that, the time that, you know, started to accumulate it over time, then, you know, then the quality, then, you know, the brandings and the user trust and safety everything that will start to matter. And we still have strong belief that we're much better positioned in that. In terms of marketing, that I'm not saying we'll never build a marketing team. We will. And we will build a marketing team, but more focused on consumer applications, you know, more focused on the brandings and more focusing on the user and also community engagements. The user acquisition, that I think there are two ways of user acquisition. There's one way that is really have the user are interested to do, to increase awareness and convert them into a real user. There's another part type of user acquisition would probably in the city of value, probably see it more than anywhere in the world that the, it's not necessary user acquisition, but rather is caught a page view requisition or download number requisition. That is for the short term and for some of the back for better, forget about it, you know, financial engineering for VCs. So there when I was doing the investment that we categorize a company into three, there's the two consumer, two C business, there's the two business called a two B business, right? And there's the two V business that's called a two VCs. And that is what is really against right. I'm not against marketing. My major is marketing. And it's a powerful tool. It's a really great organization to have to build any great companies, but I'm against what I'm against this that if it's unnecessary, then we shouldn't spend a burn on money to just pump up the numbers and do a two VC business. Right. And also that in our case that our limitation today is supply. So if we're a quieter user and we don't have the vehicle ready, then we just got one more Pesitile user. And that's not what we wanted to be. So I think there are a little bit clarification that need to explain that it's not the, we don't want to market at all. Marketing is a great apartment. I will build over time. One general one specific China had this bike share boom track. What did you guys learn from that? And one specific issue they had was people weren't taking this sort of last mile right by direction. People are sort of going to one direction. So how are you guys familiar with that problem? Yeah, I think we learned a lot from the. Oh, yeah, sorry. So the question was that the other the China, the bike share up and down trend in China. And what we have learned from that. The second question is more a little bit more tactic right that user tended to take what a traffic the wave of traffic user tended to take one way not by directional. And how do we deal with that? So I think the first part of a yes, we deal, you know, answer to it is we learn a lot. And the learning that is the user will use it if it's convenient enough. You know, if the affordability availability and accessibility there that is user will use it. I think that's what we learned on a positive side on a so not so positive side that in a market like this. The over competition and lack of regulation will not only destroy the entire industry, but also destroy the community we live in. So every company, even we don't set up the rule right that the game theory, the, you know, the competitive strategy or whatnot are incentivizing the companies to put most of the cheapest vehicle on the street as soon as possible. Right, you add that three things together, then it's a disaster. The disaster is like cheapest vehicle, fastest ever time and also maximum volume. And it destroyed the unicomics, destroyed the pricing, destroyed the street parkings and also destroyed the trust with cities and communities. So that's what we try to avoid ever since that we started, you know, the company that we what we set to ourselves is that we're okay if we grow slower, but we're not okay that if that, you know, it's becomes a really a disaster for the city. And that is one of the learning, the second part of the learning is, you know, in terms of the how we collaborate with others, you know, we collaborate with communities and bike collations and all that. You think that's we are just part of the bigger movement and we should, you know, instead of being the, the only, you know, force out there trying to do it. We believe that we're part of the speaker movement and we should collaborate with communities and also organizations to push this forward. And there's another good learning out of that is that nobody have ever seen a physical asset, you know, program has been operated at that kind of skill. So how do you even operate it? I think the few companies in China deployed 40 million bikes in about a year, you know, 40 million in about a year. How do you even operate that? And we learned a lot from that that, you know, how data becomes a central piece of it. How do we use that to determine the, you know, the allocate, sorry, the locations of the vehicles, how do we determine that how it's got to rebalance them or that. And we further enhanced it with, you know, the advanced sensors and with the attack talents we have here. And you speak data to help us to further optimizing the fleet as well as mitigate some of the, you know, potential problems. And the, for the traffic pattern, I think that's actually very interesting since in that part of it that the city is in China and any US, any Europe, any many other markets just build very differently. And the user pattern is just very differently without going to the details, just think about one thing, right. And in China, if we, if we say there are 20 million people in Beijing, they all actually live in Beijing. When we look at a city like San Francisco or Chicago or Seattle, San Francisco have, have a population roughly about 800,000. They're not a million that commute into it every day. And the pattern is entirely different, you know, compared to a city that everyone loves just live and breathe in there. So the traffic pattern is much more spread out as we see even in Paris, right. Paris is a slightly different that it has a lot of tourists as well. But then the, you know, the pattern we've seen is not only by direction, but it's kind of like representing or reassembling that the, how you, how you walk. No, you think about that, either on a daily basis, the long trip that you take a train or drive into the city and then you have five to seven different short trips, you know, between the locations. So that that is one of the, you know, pattern we notice very differently from China. So you mentioned something interesting with respect, basically to your vision of the company, you don't identify as a bike or scooter company. So, you know, with that in mind, where, where do you want to take this, you know, in the next five to ten years? Yeah, I think the, for five years, I will, huh? Oh, yeah, sorry, it's my bad. So the question is that the, you know, since lime is not identifying yourself as a bike share or the scooter share company, then the, you know, where we see we take lime in the, you know, time frame of five or ten years. I think in a five year time frame that will further innovate and further iterate on how to where we have right there are still a lot of innovation to be done that can we provide more micromanability, you know, vehicles to the users and beyond micromanability, you know, the EVs and, you know, that can we provide a comprehensive platform for user to get around the city. No matter is the distance of it, no matter the outfit, no matter the purpose, no matter the, you know, the weather that they were further enhanced working on that. And then the, you know, also what we wanted to further enhance the user experience is connecting them to the local merchants and to the, to the happenings, if you would, to rediscover the city. And two things that I think very interesting to share that, you know, first is that we're redefining what is called neighborhood. If you live in a city or not, your neighborhood is defined by how comfortably you can walk to which in, you know, in an urban environment is two by two block right that two by two blocks that, you know, does your neighborhood where you find the coffee shop you always go to the breakfast place you always go to. And, you know, that like, you know, dinner, right or whatnot. With our services with the same amount of time that user can easily get to a neighborhood of 10 by 10. It's not a 5x bigger. It's 25x bigger in terms of the neighborhood. So, you know, you then rediscover the city you've been living in for a long time. Kind of familiar, but you rediscover that there's so many things you don't know about it. There's so many people you could be connected to. So that is what we, you know, by leveraging the LBS or location, you know, data, user, user patterns. We want to provide more information for them to know what's happening, to know, you know, what are the other choices and options. So in five years, hopefully we will get there as well. And then, you know, to connect them to the local merchants and happenings. And in 10 years that, I think you were further advanced, there are a few things that will inevitably happen. Right. First is the most of transportation will be electrified. I don't think anyone will disagree with that. Right. So how we prepared for that, how we bring, how we accelerate electrification of modern transportation. AV will be coming. Automobile driving will be coming. How do we provide a service layer, how we provide the infrastructures to get ready for the autonomous driving. And in the third thing, I think hopefully that will happen is we help the city to redesign it to be more shared, to be more green, you know, to be more active and also healthier.
