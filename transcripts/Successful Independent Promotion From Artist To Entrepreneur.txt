 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Welcome to a special edition of the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Lecture Series. This episode coincides with the launch of the Global Innovation Tournament, which is hosted by STVP. During the week-long competition, students around the world are challenged to make saving money fun. Intuit is the generous sponsor of this international event. Our guest speakers today are award-winning music producer Quincy Delight Jones III, known as QD3, and Grammy Award-winning rap artist Camillean Air. To set the stage, Stanford President John Hennessy talks about the importance of having an entrepreneurial mindset to solve big problems and to make amazing things happen. This is special for a lot of reasons. We've got a couple of people for you to get to know later in the program. But first of all, you might know this person. This is President John Hennessy. Let's bring them out. Thanks, Tom. Well, welcome, everyone. How do we change the world? How do we make it better? How do we think about solving the massive problems we have around the world? We think outside the box. We bring innovation. We bring new approaches. We bring an entrepreneurial mindset to things. And I think that kind of thinking is what shapes the world. It's certainly changed my life and it changed Silicon Valley more than 20 years ago. When I sat down with the group of graduate students and just said, it's going to be possible to build a computer on a single chip. What does this mean for the world? How does it change the way we should think? How should it shape the way in which computers are designed? That kind of thinking, that kind of thinking outside the box. I still remember back many years ago when I got called over to a trailer, a trailer where a few graduate students were sitting. I went into their office with stacked pizza boxes this high and used co-cans. I walked in and they said, well, we want to show you something new. It's called Yahoo. This is the way Dave and Jerry were solving a problem they saw, which was the internet was expanding so fast that they and their friends wanted to keep track of interesting websites. So they showed me a demo. And I knew the minute they showed me that their favorite pizza parlor would take orders on the worldwide web that the web was going to change our world. And sure enough, it has. Two young guys, Larry Page, Sergey Brinn, sitting there thinking about internet search. There are already internet search engines out there. You can go out on the web and use them. They were built by great people. They work pretty well. Two young guys saying, well, maybe we can do better. And that un-inhibited, that willingness of a young person to rethink how a problem was solved, rethink how we approach it. Change the world because it led to Google, great search engine and a company that's done phenomenally well and changed the world. I was fascinated to see recently that the best way to predict flu outbreaks in the United States is to go on Google because more people use Google when they get flu to find out what they should do to take care of their symptoms. So it predicts flu outbreaks two weeks before the National Center for Disease Control knows there are flu outbreak. Look how we've changed the world. But I think we're also changing the world using innovation to solve big problems. Take the fundamental question of how we think about our natural resources in this country. How do we use our land and our water? Well, there's a great project led by one of our faculty members, Gretchen Daly, thinking about how you think about natural resources and their value to us. This kind of thinking, this project called the Natural Capital Project, has saved the city of New York hundreds of millions of dollars by preserving watershed and using the natural ability of the land to filter water as opposed to building filtration plants that would have cost a billion dollars. It's a completely different way of thinking. Or a class at Stanford called entrepreneurial design for extreme affordability that encourages students to think about designing products which save lives and make lives better in developing countries in the poorest countries around the world. How many levels of projects they've had? A scheme for building a low cost baby incubator for $25 that can save low birth weight babies who are born in countries far removed from medical care. Or a project to improve drip irrigation that allows farmers to use drip irrigation thereby preserving fresh water and making more effective use of it. Or a project to design a new solar lantern that can be used in small villages that don't have access to electricity. It's that kind of innovative thinking that is going to change our world. We face a lot of problems out in the world. We have to think about them with a new mindset. We've got to approach them differently. You're going to participate and have the chance to participate in a global innovation tournament. I want you to think outside the box. Think about new approaches to problems. Think differently. Who knows? One of you may solve one of the great problems we face in around the world. Good luck in the tournament and have a great time. Thank you. Let's bring out chameleonaire and QD3. Come on. Let's hear it from you. That's the most fun I've ever had at one of these seminars. It's like, thank you for making my day. I'm going to have a great time. I'm going to have a great time. Great.

Great. Great. Great. Such a wonderful opportunity. Thank you. Great. What's happen? Good. Great. sea wave. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Before you know it, you know the project was released and it went multi platinum and did really well So I think that with that proved us is that you don't necessarily if you have a personal connection with your audience and you're speaking right to the core demo In an authentic way that connects with them I think that's almost better sometimes than buying a billboard on sunset boulevard or something like that So I think in that sense, you know We've continued that tradition of just doing a lot of organic marketing like with our little way movie that we're about to put out now Same thing, you know we go to the fan sites that are really interested in his content And there's a lot of sites that need content from little way in the exclusive stuff So you just barter give them what they need and for us it's great because we're reaching the core demo head on and You know why would you go and buy you know TV ads if you can go straight to your audience, you know, so I think it's Personally, I love chatting online with people anyway. That's like one of my favorite things to do so it's You know, it's definitely gonna have a whole bunch of new friends here. Yeah So can they really get there? I mean, how does that relate to you? How y'all feeling? I ain't gonna lie it used to be a lot more fun when I wasn't the boss You know like when I used to just sit back and other people used to do all the work Then it used to be a lot more fun and now that I'm in the boss position and I have to see the inner workings behind what goes on Then it takes away the fun But the money thing still has to happen like you have to make money because money makes the world go around So you have to get creative and with me. I've always been creative, you know, I used to do stuff like um Like before I went to Universal on my website, you know I had like 3.5 million hits before Universal ever came and they were wondering how I had such a big digital presence But it's because I used to just get creative like I knew that I had a certain amount of fans and And I want to make myself look bigger than all my my fellow friends So I would go film everything that they did and put it on my site and then all their fans would come to my site And you would look at my site and it looked like there are all community fans But they weren't really it was everybody's fans and with me interacting with them Then eventually they all became my fans because I'd start I used to give away like Oh, I don't know what it was at that time was like a say girl or something like that. I used to give away like Video games and do trivia and all kind of stuff and then when I went to Universal I was like um, I want to um Basically, you know, they wanted to take my domain name commander.com and the contract and I was like well This is a deal break. I don't want to give it up unless you can keep it at the same standards and I was like Well, can you do this can you do this and they were like no, we don't have the resources to do that So I was like what do you mean? I used to have like this little shout-cash server where we get up my DJ would DJ some songs and I'd be rapping and then a screen would come on and they would see us Before everybody was even doing the website things so all the other rappers should call me a nerd because it's to be like you know He's all on that internet stuff man. He's a dweeb, you know, I'm saying And then like 5 million ringtones later, you know So I mean you just got to got to be creative. I always did stuff like that That's what made it fun like to this day. I still interact with a lot of fans on my farm board I know it's not typical of a rapper, but you know, they give you all kind of crazy ideas They make graphics for me all kind of stuff like that and then they don't really they just want a free shirt every now and then you know Well, so do let me ask you do do both of you consider yourself entrepreneurs I mean, this is what we teach you we teach entrepreneurship and high tech entrepreneurship I mean from talking to you backstage you guys are really high tech and maybe your entrepreneurs, too. Do you see yourself that way? I got into hip-hop is a break dancer, you know the main and I just love the culture to begin with and You know starting as a break dancer at 14 that led me to making records with two-pock and all the different people Making films and now we're doing video games and we're about to launch a few sites You know, so I think that if you're passionate about something and you want to be the best at it You know you never know where that can take you so I've become an entrepreneur in the process I start out as more of an artist and then in the process, you know became An entrepreneur for sure and I think the entrepreneurial spirit is really strong in hip-hop like if you look at a lot of these guys didn't even finish high school Jay Z 50 Cent whoever else and you know now they're multi-millionaires and they have liquor brands and clothing brands and all these different things So I think there's a certain drive like even working with two-pock like he'd be in the studio and record five songs a day effortlessly You know and then at night he would go and Record a movie and then come back to the studio the same night, you know the main so it was just That there's a certain drive that I think Really adds to the entrepreneurship with a lot of the rappers, you know With me it was kind of the same way, you know, I was the artist at first and then you kind of you know start having to take the entrepreneur Kind of standpoint like um, you know I had to learn a lot of stuff quick like basically even when I used to sell mixtape side of my trunk, you know I used to just Pass a CD to somebody and then they would just walk past me like to the end of the park a lot and throw it on the ground And then I'd be like man, you know Selling the whole bunch of CDs out of trunk and then I had to learn how to sell independent records And then once I learned that then I started hanging around people and I was advancing quicker than them Like I used to be hanging around my friends and they'd just be like, you know Sitting there chilling chilling, you know, and I used to hate that like when you ask somebody like what are you doing? I'm chilling like why are you chilling like let's let's do something Let's let's make something and all my friends was always like that So then I just started like kind of just leaving them and started just you know studying stuff like I used to be In school and I used to just be mad because I wanted to learn quicker like everybody this in school always says that they'd be like You know, well, why do I need to learn this I used to be like that because I used to be like man Not because I didn't want to learn I just don't want to learn this I want to learn this so I can use it and Get out of here real quick and get into the real world, you know And I always used to be like that then when I got into the major world, which is universal records It's like a whole other world you had to learn business really quick because Perfect example like you know, I always used to order like I used to take a photo shoot It cost me $10,000 to do a photo shoot 10,000 I'm like wow, these better be some wonderful looking pictures, right? So you know, they send me all these 400 pictures. I'm going through them like oh, yeah, like that shot I like that shot. I'm gonna get that shot too And then they only give me like four of them and I have to stretch four images for a whole year with my album promotion And I'm like why do I only get four images when I pay $10,000 and I saw 400 I found out to touch up one photo cost $700 To touch up one photo call $700 so I got three of them is 2100 and I have to pay that back So now I start to learn a business real quick because when your check comes and there's nothing on it Then you're like why where's my check? Oh, you bought a hundred pictures and that's where your platinum check went to So I was like nah, I started learning everything really quick and then You know, I want to see my money and you kind of have to and that's why a lot of artists are starting to become business man They're starting to own their publishing and stuff like that you kind of have to you know Yeah, and I think that you know labels don't necessarily want you to be educated on those issues I think a lot of people learn the hard way the first time around And then they get it all together, you know, and you learn like you said by necessity basically Yeah, definitely have to you have to be you know, somebody that really really wants to learn like the people that don't get Don't want to learn get left in the past like this a lot of major label companies You know the majors is what would you call them? Like you said the not to giant like the David and the Goliath, you know They're they're Goliath and they're feel like there's big company and you know There's other smaller companies that are learning quicker they're being more innovative and they're passing these guys up You know like I go in these major labels and they got like these basic HTML websites and it doesn't do anything I'm like looking at it like show dates and it has like show dates from 1996 And I'm like who's paying for bandwidth on this, you know the main like who's wasting their money and they'll be like A lot of times they don't get it and then you'll talk to this little 17 year old kid and he just understands everything Yeah, he's like talking to you about all kind of stuff like you going to a rapper conference and talk to them about widgets and everybody's like Yep, which is it what is that? So so let's build on that How is the changing technology this evolving technology we've got a lot of students in this room We've got a lot of technical expertise how To the things that they're designing and developing affect the music industry these days I think to his point about the majors is that you know for a long time the majors had a dictatorial marketing approach So the only way for you to find out if the record was good was to actually buy it And you know when the internet came you know all of a sudden records would leak People would have access to distribute their own records and the power that the labels had you know 10 years ago say was exactly that it was a A route to market basically and now that anybody can get on YouTube and basically create their own TV channel You know that power is gone so So I think that technology is really leveled to playing field in a lot of ways, you know So I think it allows every single person in the world to be an entrepreneur and that's really what I love about The whole notion of that it's a free platform So like if you want to become a TV producer you can start on YouTube for no cost and it's basically like using these digital platforms I call it a term for it is e-hustling basically and it's available to anybody You know and I think it's going to be a great Sort of equalizer in the industry and also for you know communities that um May not have the necessary revenue to to finance a little studio whatever else they can just go online and use Internet solutions, and I think it's amazing and I think we're going to see like the urban community like when you gave them the Charntable the turntable was designed to just play records with and you give it to the urban community and they flip it all up Scratch with it and all that kind of stuff and I think that type of innovation is going to happen in technology also where you know Where as technology becomes a little bit more simplified online, you know The urban community I think is really going to come through and twist it up in some way and innovate and And you know find innovative revenue streams and all that kind of thing so Obviously the internet has had a huge effect on distribution and you know reaching the audience in a much more effective way What any other technology that you're I know you you're you're spending a lot of time learning these tools You know one of the things you're most excited about That's available now when things you're hoping in the future. I thought you're gonna call me out about Twitter He's out there too. Yeah, everyone knows about this. Yeah, I know Twitter should have a lot of people scared though Because like say friends you have a publicist and you pay like 20,000 something crazy Now you could just tell everybody instantly. It's like wait a second. Why need you, you know You know, I know no disrespect to my publicist because I don't know she's gonna see that you know, but um She does a good job, but um now it's like you know having a direct connection with the audience that you're trying to reach You know, it isn't you know not even if you're a rapper you could be like you know with Walgreens or Walmart, you know everybody has an audience and you have to try to capture it You know, so your audience starts building and then you can directly communicate with them So why like it cuts out all the middle man stuff and I think that's the beautiful thing of it like to me Like I get scared when I see stuff like Twitter like this a lot you could do like I have real stalkers And they can get any information they want on Twitter and a lot of people don't even realize how you can actually be on there And you can look at somebody else's whole string like a lot of people still don't even realize that and that's scary because It'll be certain people I won't respond to on purpose because I know if I do everybody's gonna look at the conversation and see what they said But you know just looking at this and technology is just taking you know My world somewhere to where like I feel like I'm leaving a lot of people because like I mean him started going to tech conferences Right and I used to be mad because this is a whole another world like what do you call it the bubble? It's like another bubble and in my world is different and when I came over here MC Hammer was the only one that was like going to tech conferences and I said man I'm gonna have beef with MC Hammer when I see him and I saw MC Hammer I was like man, I come you didn't tell all those rappers that this is going on and he had kind of had the same grouch that I did Nobody really wanted to learn this stuff to them. It's kind of like You know dorky, but or big brother Yeah, but this is like to me. It's like impressive. I wish I had an opportunity being a class like this or school like this and Be learning ahead of everybody else because these are the people that's gonna create the next Twitter I saw the Twitter people at a tech conference and I was like um You know they were telling me about it like people want less, you know You know if you you cat eat some cat food you can save my cats eating cat food and I was like Man, I think people want more. I don't think it's gonna work and then later on it was like oh man I should have got their contacts so I can get verify No, well, I think I checked the other day and you had like 174,000 followers So you're kind of thinking okay. I'm following So uh Let me ask you getting a talk about you know the traditional model is you know having you know Marketing person in a strategy person and a publicist who's on your team these days? I mean who do you think is most important to have in your inner circle to make you successful? I think in terms of music and maybe even film I think that the whole paradigm is shifting So whereas you know back in the day if you look at music, you know, you had a drummer singer guitar player and a saxophone as to whatever right? I think You know moving forward we're probably gonna need some additional members. So you might need a merch designer A viral marketer an application designer so that everything you do has sort of a look and feel that that you own and So I could definitely see the configuration of the team changing drastically And you know as record sales are declining a lot of the revenues coming from live shows And especially merch, you know, I mean so I think that you know adding those members as part of your team and Creating a look and feel for your band that only your band has I think definitely is probably gonna be a model of the future You know set out your merch line is like part of your whole rollout So it's just as important as your video, you know, and when you do applications they have a certain Sensibility to them that only your team can create and I think that's what's missing from the record industry right now Labels have one team that does all the different groups that they work with so everything looks and feels the same. So I think You know, I think just changing the constellation and creating pods that are unique to each group Should at least be part of the future. I'd like to see it because it would add, you know, sort of a breath of fresh air to the industry Yeah, people that do like digital media and stuff like that and you know Social network marketing to me. Those are people that make everything, you know run you know like perfect example Like little Wayne is probably one of the biggest rap artists. He sold a million first week and everything I was talking to him earlier. I was like does he have a website like I couldn't even think of one little Wayne website Like as big as he is and then I've never even seen a little Wayne DVD. I've never seen one as big as he is You know, so he's actually putting one out That would be pretty big to see that because like content as can people just want content There's all these social networks blogs and people are just their attention spans are short They want to see everything that they can in the short period of time and you just have to feed them and you know The majors for a while when we say majors, I mean like you know the major record companies They were kind of like bottling up stuff like no, we're only gonna give them this or you know Even a lot of stuff is coming back to bite them now is like they were you know all these companies Google or iTunes or whoever came to them in the beginning and they didn't want to do deals Where they tried to shut them all down and then next thing you know they became the big dogs And now they're like trying to figure out how to capture their content, you know There's some little kid who has a website somewhere and he's making more money off a little Wayne than they are probably you know online because he's got this file sharing You know internet website and he's doing all kind of stuff with it He's got ads up there and all kind of stuff So I think the people that are able to capture the content, you know like people like him that actually you know get little Wayne Behind the scenes and you know people still pay for that They still pay for the touring aspect. They still pay to see the the brand if you can capture that and sell it monetize it Those are the people that's going to make you know my industry go around, you know That's a good point because I think that you know if the entry point to the record business before was a distributor Now that those platforms are ubiquitous I think that you know a web.designer might be more valuable to somebody you know like little Wayne or a filmmaker who can tell and translate his story in a compelling way That makes people fall in love with him as an individual and basically Prevade his messages and who he is as a person in a way that makes people believe in him versus just a hit single You know, so I think radio is is probably going to slowly die off and I think that you know having a personal connection like you were saying and just going direct online and Putting a web designer and a filmmaker on your team add that to the band, you know And you've got a whole different sort of entry point to the industry and I think that's really a compelling notion because you know film If you look at the records that sold the most and the last 20 years Purple rain, you know, M&M's record when he did his movie all those were like Multimillion multi multi-million sellers and I think a big reason is because when you add visuals the things It just makes it a more compelling offering overall so you're not just dealing with audio But it's visual and you can wrap yourself around that. You know how many arguments I have to have with my record company like when they're trying to book travel I'll be like well, I have to like my cameraman has to go with me no matter what and they don't appreciate His work and I have to give him all these other titles and stuff just to give him to come with me, you know Like he's my assistant. He's everything, you know I'm saying so they'll at least pay for him and then you know We'll do a music video and they won't have nobody there shoot no b-roll or nothing But he'll have all the content and then guess what they call like hey you think we get some of that video footage But you know And the great thing about that is they're leaving money on the table for smaller companies, you know And right now the only profitable record labels of the indies right now And there are people that are using the web primarily as there as their marketing vehicle So go figure, you know Well, so let's let's build on that What is your business model? I mean, you know as an entertainer these days, you know We know that the really evolving ways in which you look at how you monetize what you're doing So how do you think about that? Do you think about your business model? Um with me It's crazy because I'm in the business of making money but I don't I had a song called and love of my money when I first came out with But when I was independent and all the fans just think that I was just so in love with my money But I really wasn't you know what I mean because you know sometimes you can want to make so much money so bad That you just greedy like every dollar is not a good dollar like sometimes it's about moral sometimes it's about authenticity Sometimes it's about other things but in the end you end up making money by not doing it if that makes any sense You know what I mean like perfect example like there's I probably got offered like seven times to do reality shows You know what I mean and I turned down seven of them but it's because I felt there was an authentic to my brand Who I was but I could have took that money But right now if I walked up here a lot of y'all probably laughing at me because You know Sometimes people just do the craziest things for money So you know with me it's all about being authentic and then being you know knowing your strengths and your weaknesses like When I went to Universal they actually were going to give my deal to somebody else And it was a big company that I used to be on and they say well we're going to give this deal to them So why should we give this deal to you you want a partnership deal with us and not a normal artist deal Why should we give you this and I said What I told him is I said okay, look I know everything about selling makeshaves I know almost everything about selling independent records and I have a track record to prove it If you told me right now to go to China Baghdad Shanghai everywhere and told me to sell records I probably wouldn't know what to do But I'm smart enough to know that I don't know what to do and so Who to get you know that mean so I know my strengths And I know my weaknesses and I fill in on the weaknesses I delegate duties to other people So if you were to give me that money I would know who to get I would know who to do and I started giving them examples And they're like whoa Maybe this guy is smarter than we think and then later on they told me after the conversation They're like when you leave New York you're going to be signing Universal Records And I was like yeah, I whatever you know saying And then I left I try to leave and then I was coming out of my hotel and you know And I was sitting there like no where you going? Where you going you know and they actually like Went through the whole process and you know my lawyer called me and he was like You know, what did you say to him? And I was like man, I just told him everything everybody told me not to tell him And then he was like you know, man This is the best the biggest first time offer I've ever seen for a new artist And I was like wow for real And then you know later on I left and went to Puerto Rico to this mixed-show power summit And Universal was up there and there's all these record labels in there And some guy from Universal gets up there and goes You know Universal Records would like to announce we just signed Houston artist Comillionaire and I'm like what everybody's congratulating and they're all happy I'm so mad because I'm like looking at my account on my phone and I like the money ain't Win in my account yet. So how y'all signed me? And I was like man it better be in there in the morning And you know they always say it's a you know It takes seven days we have to process it man in the morning I looked at my account. It was like zero zero zero zero zero. I was like oh snap Then I was like wow, you know, so business of being authentic work for me, you know what I mean? Well Obviously, you know you sign all these deals and you're selling CDs you're selling music What about concerts? What about merchandise? Are these really important parts of your business model? I mean how do you how do you break up how you are generating revenue of these different channels Is that something you guys think about me and him just now talked about we're still trying like we just now Started talking about this before we got up here like man Maybe me and you should do something together You know, I mean we're making business deals while we're here But it's because like you know, I could have probably made a lot more off of merchandising stuff like that But I like I was telling him earlier. I said, you know, there's people that actually You know, I'll go to a merchandising company and they have the biggest thing They have like all these shirts. They're scalable like and shipped to everywhere in India But then I'll be like okay, well, let's look at the creative and then they'll have a t-shirt And it'll be the square and it'll be like my face on it and I'm like Why do I want to sell something with my face on I wouldn't wear my face, you know Like not that I ain't pretty or nothing, but I'm just I wouldn't wear that and I was like Let's do something to wear it. Anybody that doesn't know me is gonna want to wear it You know, I mean they're gonna they're gonna you know embracing and that person can be promoting for me And a lot of them would be like oh no, we don't have the capability to do that We kind of just upload a picture and and I'm this is big corporation So I wouldn't do the deal with them and then it'd be somebody that understands my creative part But they wouldn't they wouldn't be able to do it. So I was just like man I need somebody that can I'd rather not do that deal until I find somebody that can do it right I believe in just doing it right, you know me and him to kind of talk about that, you know Yeah, I think now nowadays it's about you know starting every project with a multi-platform rollout of mine So you think about your live show you think about your potential TV play Music play obviously and then maybe there's a creative application that you can use of the hub for all this or website You know where you create a community around each project, you know So that's how we do things when we're like with little wainfers as we have an iPhone app We're creating a microsite for it and everything is about building communities around it So that you can basically direct market to the people who care the most and then they can help you spread the word So I think it's it's creating projects um Where each platform focus is on the unique functionality of of each lap. I mean where each play focuses on the unique functionality of the platform So if you're doing a mobile play, what's the unique functionality that mobile phone has that you can create a standalone opportunity with You know, so I think that that's you know how to probably look at it from here on instead of training it like a record that we're then going to send out All these other outlets the same way, you know treat each platform like it's its own project, you know And then make each platform synergize with the next. I think that's really what the majors Still probably need to figure out at this point is how do you tie it all together synergistically instead of having everything Separate great. The business model has changed too because like you know The average person might have a blueprint of what they think they're supposed to make money off this distance and that but So many other people can come in with ideas that you weren't even thinking about like I always use fans like I had the fans name my album. I had them doing everything But you can learn so much from them that you know like one time I did a contest. I was like okay I want I'm looking for a creative innovative people I want to see who could think up the best idea for this and like kids were sending me emails about iPhone apps and stuff I was just looking at them and I was like wow I like call my lawyer like hey, man What I got to do to do business with this dude to where he doesn't sue me, you know what I mean? And then he was like well, you got to get you know, so I'm like instead of just taking this kids idea I was like I want you to keep on coming with more ideas like that and let's do business on this idea It might be somebody 17 years old and Waco, Texas You know the lawyers will tell me all you can't do that because there's a you have to be over 18 And we'll figure it out, you know what I mean? But they'll come up with so much stuff and the reason why that works is just created a whole new revenue from me Because I didn't know it's this because this is the person that's actually the consumer that's using that stuff Like they have all the apps they're the ones testing it. I don't have the time So they told me all the good and bad things about every app and what's not good and what so he kind of did all the market research for me already And they'll just send it to me in a nice email I'm just reading it like wow this is genius. So I kind of use people like I think that's what measures loss They they always show the song down your throat instead of asking you what you think, you know Like you might love Whatever hinder one republic or whatever they'll give you one option And this is the single and their force at radio instead of giving you an option And then that's why the album comes out and everybody picks the song that they like You know, I think people need to do more of that like Interact with people like when you go to a tech conferences There's all these people and they're like in competition with each other But you never know if you want company that could work with another and they can gel together And they might be able to build vote on you know, so no, I think that's that's a great point I mean I would say 90% of Of the feedback that I take on our content even when we're creating ideas and formulating them come from just regular users online You know because they're the ones who understand the market the best They're the people who are serving you know, and a lot of I'll have a lot of conversations with them You know in chat rooms and forums and Twitter wherever else and I incorporate that feedback almost more than I do with my in house producers Because their sensibilities are right on point and those are the people who are serving and obviously that's who we want to Please with the content so in terms of fielding ideas Taking feedback from them. We take that really serious And I think that the majors in a lot of ways they still look at it like we're the dictators and we tell you what you're going to like and that sort of thing and I think um I think the more humble you can be about the creative process and realize that you know, they probably know better than you at this point Um, I think you know the better off they'll be and I think that's really Probably the biggest hurdle hurdle for the majors right now is they're trying to bring it back to the dictatorial way You know, but like I said you can't buy your way in the markets as easy today as you could before You could run the greatest ad in the world And for a car or whatever you or record or whatever and then people go on Facebook and be like how is it And if the response is negative that's it. They trust their peers more than they trust an ad so it's a no brainer really So I'm curious. Where do you see the biggest opportunities for innovation in the music industry? I mean here we've got all these innovators in the audience. What do you want them to invent for you? Hmm. I'll tell you one one one Area that I think is really compelling um, you know as a producer as a music producer Everything that you want to do whether it's auto-tune or pitching a song up and down or whatever else It all happens through applications and either like a sequencer program or audio recording program So I was trained to basically think like plugins and absences to to get anything accomplished So I think that one area that really interests me is we have this huge library of a video footage of two-pock and little Wayne and 50 cent and all these people And um, I think it's really interesting to sort of leverage applications against Content and create hybrids sort of what jib jib is doing where you can insert yourself into somebody else's content No, because the problem when you look at YouTube right now is that they're basically a server company in a lot of ways So um a lot of the content isn't necessarily high quality But if you give people high quality content to play with and then they can sort of interact with that content You know by default you're gonna have a celebrity in the piece by default There's gonna be high quality shots there and you can find creative ways to allow users to mash that up Even if it's a template that makes it really simple like jib jib I think that's really interesting because then it's like you can give them one clip of two-pock saying something and then they can interact with that in 2000 different people create two thousand different pieces that are really funny So I think that's the whole application content hybrids is really compelling and very cool I wouldn't even I wouldn't even know what to tell anybody to make you know I like I want people that's thinking way ahead of me, you know There's people that like there's a lot of things that the music industry uses that weren't necessarily made for the music industry that end up being beneficial for us you know But I think you know you go to these Comforters and meet all these innovative people and they say stuff and at the time you might be thinking like man I don't know what this guy's on but later on it might be something, you know Like uh like example I gave you about Twitter and then you know There's people that that that no but I you do have to understand the audience though because sometimes You'll get so stuck in this idea that you have and it'll be the best thing to you and then just people don't embrace it like that And they they have to embrace it somehow it might not be today But sometimes they're gonna have to and if you've been doing something for a hundred years And you've never got any good feedback you might want to move on to some else You know what I mean? What might want to move on to some else like if I was doing rap like I always knew I'd be successful I put out a song telling everybody I knew I'd be successful They asked me how did you know you'd be successful? I'd say because I knew that if I was doing something that I wasn't successful at I would move to something else If I was doing rap like I try to be a basketball player They ain't work, you know what I mean? So you know I got cut I moved on to something else and then I started doing it and it started working for me And I didn't necessarily think I was gonna be a rapper But then it ended up working and I used that to step to other things and now when people see me show up in these tech conferences and stuff They're looking like man, what was the rapper doing here? Like I'm not trying to learn like them, you know And I think you know in my opinion Just the people that these conferences and the people that you know are trying to create something and build something and make something or the people that's gonna Be leaders of our economy and I want to hang around with people like that They might say something I have no idea what you're talking about But that's the person I want because you just talk me something Not somebody that every time we talk about something It's already know that like I want to learn something. So that's the people in the audience Hopefully everybody somebody in here will be the winner of this. Yeah, and then I'll still the idea Great. Great. Well, you came to the right place to learn something So I would and we just got a few more minutes and I recently just learned about you guys do a lot of things that Have a big positive social impact and I know QDU just showed me a video the other day about this year five MK project and it's so ties into what we're trying to do with the innovation tournament Maybe you can tell us a little bit about it Yes, so we're basically I'm working with this person named John Hope Bryant and he is the Financial literacy advisor to the president and we have this program called five million kids and basically We're trying to educate file me finding kids on financial literacy, you know, because um, it's it's it's a basic skill that most people Certainly in the inner cities just don't have you know, and you see a lot of a lot of you know Certainly a lot of urban artists come into a lot of money and then two years later, you know, it's all gone So we're basically trying to educate them and use hip-hop artists to sort of make it sexy, you know So the whole campaign the name of the slogan for the campaign is making smart sexy and I'm the digital chair for it So my piece is basically to Encourage them to learn how to e hustle basically and And learn how to use these digital platforms not only to to learn accounting But you know, we're teaching them how to create iPhone applications, you know, and I think that um It's just such a missing piece certainly for the urban demographic, but even at large, you know, most people don't have that That is a foundation say great And I think that you know with every project that we do like even the beef series that has to do with feuds and hip-hop There's always an underlying mission like my father always taught me that you know If you have an underlying mission that's positive that that's for more than just More benefit than just for yourself, you know, you'll have that extra strength when you need it You know, and it'll allow you to continue and fight harder when the times get rough and whatever And so with each film that we do, you know, we always sort of try to insert history or some type of end goal That People may not recognize them when they're watching it as an overt sort of teaching method But then once you've watched the whole film you'll draw certain conclusions that I think are beneficial in a lot of ways So showing things in context and Leading them to a certain way of thinking after they've watched a certain film You know, so like would be for instance, you know, we show not just the problem issue With these two artists feuding or whatever, but we also show the resolution and a lot of times on MTV you don't get that Oh, love. I was yeah, he might not even know this but he had a beef series and he put up like what was it playing? It was playing everywhere on TV right? Yeah, it was playing all these channels and it was getting real big And he put out a DVD called beef and I ended up being on one because I had a feud with him out former partner So it was like the whole story of the whole beef thing right and I was like what who is this guy QD3? I'm about to shut him down I called my lawyer and I was like yeah, man, we shut this guy down I need to get any of them off the shelves and then he sent me back this this list of like it was like some technical stuff A reasons why he could do what he did and I was like wow Like he basically put together there's some kind of public I don't know what it was, but I was like That's when I had that much more respect for him because I was like wow and then after talking to him He explained why he does you know certain things like I was like why would you know? You know you're doing this beef DVD and you got me and my boy arguing and showing that but he like explain how you said it that kind of You remember that? I not remember but it was like you know, you know I felt like it was like negative energy and but he needed that to get in the door to bring all the stuff stuff Because you know, it's kind of like what reality shows exactly. I mean, you know The funny thing is that actually through that series We've actually ended more beast than anything else nothing is actually come out of that But a lot of times you know people don't know what that the person is thinking a lot of times they get in the fused because of Misunderstanding or miscommunication. So there's been about four incidents with you know major artists where they call me up And they were like you know what? You just show me that behind the scenes interview with the person I'm feuding with and you know Just telling this cool man. I don't know. They felt that way and it's all good So you know and a lot of times it's actually helped build bridges So it's I think showing it in context helps, you know who else is is gonna do that? I think for me it's more like seeing both of us up there arguing you know What's that saying two fools arguing from a distance? Both look like fools or something like that like that's kind of half-filled. I was like oh man. It's showing me on TV I was like man. I gotta quit all this nonsense. You know what I mean? So that hey Yeah, so you did good Okay, so we are out of time But I'm hoping that you guys can say one sentence is motivation to get all these folks involved with helping with this mission of Making saving money fun anything you can one set give a pitch What's that can we help you give a pitch? You guys should all get involved Amazing, it's gonna be incredible Gonna help me on here. Oh, yeah, I want to say you know good good luck with everything and um You know embrace this moment. You know how you can just live in life and just go through life and not really pay attention to the moment Like this moment you're in like I wonder if Barack who's the president of the United States right now remembers the moment when he was in an auditorium Just like this that you know what I mean like I know that sounds a little too deep for something but you know I'm wondering I'm people that forget every I forgot all my moments You know what I mean? So like this moment that you're in this could be the changing point of your career right now your life You're whatever you know like you could leave here today inspired and end up doing something that's gonna be later on I'm gonna be reading in some magazine for us about you like man. I wish I could be like him You know I mean like that's that's you need to embrace that moment You know whatever you're doing take it real seriously like I know like that sounds like some Public service announcement and stay in school and you know learn and be smart Yeah, and you're gonna put stuff on your and you're gonna put stuff on your And I just wanted to add to that that I think that um You know from everything that we're seeing right now we talk about this all the time You know, I think that it's the individual today that has the bigger shot in doing something huge than really the majors You know we talk about that all the time like they're doing pretty much everything Wrong if you're looking at the next 10 years or the next 20 years, you know, and I think that anybody in this room has the opportunity to come up with a more innovative smarter More cost effective approach, and I think that's really where it's at. It's all about innovation and connectivity and organic sort of Connectivity with whoever you're marketing to we're trying to serve And I think that's something that the majors haven't really caught on to yet and while there this window is here Like he said take advantage of it because you guys really really I mean one person that could take now through technology platforms become could become the next Innovator Steve Jobs whatever and Steve Jobs is who I look up to you know, I have a few Music idols, but I read Steve Jobs's book icon and it just put me on a whole different path my guy's my whole life man You know, so I think um really there's a lot of room, you know Steve Jobs he did his thing right now and he's I think there's room for for Yeah for just more people like him who are basically disrupting entire industries like Spotify are you guys familiar with that? Yeah, it's a new music service You know two guys in the garage can come up with stuff like that. I think that's really what's interesting now is this completely tearing down everything that we've known known you know in the past in terms of entertainment industry And maybe even technology also and just starting from scratch and looking at things from a completely different perspective Exactly look at things from a different perspective. So let's give these guys a huge man You have been listening to the draper Fisher-Jurvis and entrepreneurial thought leader series brought you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program you can find additional podcasts and videos of these lectures online at e-corner.stanford.edu You
