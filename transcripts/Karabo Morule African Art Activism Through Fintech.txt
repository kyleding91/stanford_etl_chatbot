 Who you are defines how you built. This is the entrepreneurial thought leader series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. Welcome to the entrepreneurial thought leaders series presented by STVP, the Stanford Engineering Entrepreneurship Center, and basis of the business association of Stanford Entrepreneurs students. I'm Van Baik-A-Jessem. I'm a creative story extractor, a tech media representation activist. And when I'm not hopping around the world, being an adjunct lecturer in MSME 272 for the spring quarter literally keeps me grounded. Now today I'm thrilled to be joined by my friend and fellow African Karabumurat Morale. Karabo is the founder and CEO of Capital Art, the first art collection management service for modern and contemporary African art collectors. She's also a non executive director at Time Bank, South Africa's first cloud-based banking system, but that's not all. She's an actuary by profession and how auspicious that we get to spend time with her on international women's day because Karabo is a celebrated woman in her country. She is South Africa's second black female actuary. In addition, she's an angel investor, a patron of the art since 2012 and she was selected by the world economic forum in 2018 to be a lung global leader. And this is how I know her so privileged. With her extensive background in investment banking at JP Morgan and financial and financial services at old mutual limited. She's now focused on art technology, financial inclusion, startups that focus on value addition to the continent, responsible investing and leadership. So let's dive into Karabo's fascinating career and learn more about her insights and vision for the future of African art and finance. Welcome Karabo. Happy International Women's Day, just a quick check in. It's a late way you are, where you're calling us from. Thank you so much, Mumbai. And it's really great to be in thanks for the invitation. And indeed, happy International Women's Day. It's great to be on the same panel as you, a woman who I celebrate as well. So thank you very much. Yes. It's just up to 230, I'm based in tennis, big South Africa, 230 in the morning, but I am super energized. What is conversation? We are so lucky to have you and we hope to make good use of your time. Well, okay, let's get started. This week, the theme that we've been exploring around your interview is how to have an inclusive mindset. And we discussed the importance of having awareness. So this is in terms of how the world works, how our own biases work, being sensitive to different intersectionalities. That's something that we talked quite a bit, recognizing our own privileges and being mindful of our blind spots. And this is all to primers to see opportunities that others don't. Now you are somebody that sits at the intersection of some very unique expertise. And you are also a part of our art, black and African technology, personal finance and insurance. Can you share with us how you came to be at this very interesting GPS coordinate? Yeah, I'm trying to figure out how to sum up like 41 years of existence. But yeah, I think it's it's firstly really so great that your class is engaging on these topics because I think this is what really is important to make us better citizens of the world. And I guess I'm lucky to have had this exposure from different cultures from a young age. And perhaps I think that also built the skills to appreciate nuance, but also to foster curiosity around the world around us without being overwhelmed by the diversity. And I think also fostering resilience. And I'm not unique in that at all, you know, few friends of us with a few friends we've actually had a very similar bringing and we kind of talk about this a little bit, you know, you know, from time to time about how we grew up in these suburbs, firmly known as townships, which were these constructs created by a part of the extended schools of relatively privileged, with most of them being kind of an Indian oriented with the very British culture. And then developing this sort of figurative language to exist in that world, but also to thrive in those spaces, but being still very tethered to our history and culture. And I think it gives one the opportunity to be able to see obviously the differences in resisting between these two cultures, but also to appreciate the opportunity that they present. Yeah, and I went to insurance, yeah, because I was a qualified actually and I had worked and been working in investment banking. And I never worked in a traditional insurance setting. So I thought it might be good for my life, CV to explore that and do that. And I also just to acknowledge how lucky I am to have done so because I also think I wouldn't have had the corporate success that I did if I was actually working in oil and gas. So it helped a bit to go into the insurance company. And yeah, and I think, you know, I was, you know, the first business unit that I joined was what became personal finance, it used to call retail affluent after the name of the segment that it was focusing on from a customer segmentation perspective. And I did that first and I was there strategy marketing executive. And kind of not really maybe engaging in really the personal finance aspect, it was more to understand it from a marketing perspective and managing a marketing team. But in the second student when I was the managing director and I guess when you let now leading that business, you take into consideration and take into heart quite a bit more in terms of being a custodian for that business unit. And I was very fortunate because in that interim period I worked for the employee benefits business and I was in charge of the business unit called members solutions and that was responsible for basically taking the retail proposition to the members of the retirement fans that we had listed. And then that actually one of the people who has been reaching, you know, the person in my team said, you know, you really should go and see what these financial well-being courses are about and financial education courses are about. And I went and I think, yeah, you know, you're somebody who isn't actually you've been working in banking and you feel like you know a lot about finance, then you start to really understand personal finances. And that was a seminal moment in actually kind of I think achieving, you know, quite a good measure of financial, you know, independence or just more grounding in how I thought about personal finances and that stood me so well for my journey around entrepreneurship. But also just I think being able to realize that you're not really beholden to kind of any particular job as well. I think that that also is quite freeing and it enables you to also take greater risks in being in a corporate career. So I really appreciate that for sure. Yeah. And then the tech side is interesting. I attended the Harvard Advanced Management Program in 2019 and there was a course called the Treaty First Industry Operations Manager. And I mean, obviously I've been a very big advocate of tech before that I think being a millennial, which generally are. But that course, I think really solidified in me that I wanted to go work in tech. I think that you know, because a great enable for the future, I really just thought, you know, my I really need to go and immerse myself in tech and and that's something which I then decided kind of in 2019 and something that I wanted to make sure was a really strong focus of the kind of skills that I wanted to develop over time. And so having those that double as two experiences, I think certainly helps to see gaps and connections where maybe others don't. I think it also reinforces the statistic around, you know, the diverse most diverse companies are the ones that thrive. Sure. And this might also be a platform for mature founders as well. I wanted to go back to some of the terminology that you mentioned. And I talked about townships and apartheid and of course I mentioned that you were one of the first black female South African actuaries. And for those who don't understand the context of that significance. Can you just quickly explain South Africa's history and what apartheid meant and what this inclusion and diversity, why it's such a big deal in the art world. So yeah, you know, the history of apartheid was really about kind of social exclusion, economic dispossession and really being very the kind of government being very delivered about what are the types of propitions that people of certain races could access what are the types of services that people of certain races could access. And just being very delivered about excluding, you know, what was 95% of the population and leveraging the resources, the economic resources of the whole of the country to really benefit very small minority. So who was the government because it was might not understand that even though this is an African country. Yeah, come from southern Africa, we weren't necessarily under black majority rule. But I agree it was a kind of a white nationalist government, you know, Africanna based, you know, and really focused on, you know, you know, really making sure that that was kind of the dominant culture that was operating all spheres of work and in the government as well. And so really focused on also the taking and you know, I refer to townships basically what occurred was also segregation around land and land dispossession occurred in 1913, but you know, as the apartheid rules kind of increased, it really focused on trying to make it seem like the people who were born of this land and had lived in South Africa for centuries. Literally were not existent and actually there was something that occurred across the continent as well. And actually, you know, we get a chance to talk about like the way in which art was also weaponized in that way. Yeah, but yeah. I mean, it's quite, it's quite a fascinating journey that you have lived through from where you've come from to be where you are now. So when somebody like you coming from your background and coming from the backgrounds that we have given the histories of southern Africa I'm from Zimbabwe, we've had a similar history. When somebody like you is very intentional about solving for inclusion and representation. I see them as an activist. So to me, you are an activist and capital art, the platform that you have found it is your form of activism. Can you elaborate whether you see yourself as that or not? Yes, I certainly do. And it's funny because it didn't start that way. The business was conceptualized after a discussion with an art advisor and we then worked on this concept for about a year and also during a time launched an MVP and the primary idea actually was just around to bring digitalization and Fintic thinking into collection management in South Africa. So like maybe entrepreneurs that really was just kind of like seeing an opportunity. But in research and ideation phase, some of the insights that were of interest was that these interest in African art, which had really grown over the last couple of years. So, you know, the Deloitte and Artactic report for 2021 reported that the African art market grew by 51% between 2015 and 2020. And in fact, the previous report showed that the African art market had grown by 22% between 2015 and 2018. So that also just highlights the immense growth that occurred, you know, in 2019 and 2020. Another data point, which was kind of one of the things around the thesis for the business and the opportunity was just a growth in the high number of handed with individuals that were grown the years to come and in particular across the African continent. And then also the fact that on African continent, kind of with individuals were investing less than the global average in collectibles, which is where kind of the category of as a classes that art falls into. And that was also then set against the fact that the African art market was only making up 1% of the global art market. And I thought that that was like really strange. I thought it was just such a strange number. And then you start to understand the dynamics around it and you get to get a sense of why. And yeah, hey, is it different differently considering that African art has always been part of the global narrative and part of the collective of international art. Why is that? Exactly. And the 1% really is around auction sales. And so you're so right that actually there's a lot of people who are collecting art and certainly African art has always been there in global narrative, but there's not many people within assessing kind of the financial institutions that are available in terms of realizing that wealth. And you certainly see that that's kind of been actually I think the narrative and that's kind of the insight that I had around why this was kind of important is kind of bringing that financial ecosystem to have more people think about art in that way. Thank you. That's amazing. Part of what capital art does in terms of bringing people into the financial ecosystem as you've talked about is really ventilating this concept of provenance. Can you describe what provenance means and why a deeper understanding of it helps us appreciate and objects, historical and cultural significance given the way that African art has previously been procured. So there's a really great question. So provenance is just the history of ownership from other art piece from when it was created up until today or whenever that time is when you assess and what the provenance is. And you know, yeah, so kind of going back to also kind of thinking about the activism of capital art is, you know, after the I had co founded the beginning of the business and she left kind of like I say after a year was kind of working together and it just happened after that period I had a conversation with one gidron more a famed artist and activist herself a cultural worker and a collector herself and an art advisor. And we had this walk through the constitutional court in South Africa in Johannesburg and they actually have an art gallery associated with it and she was also involved in the formation of that and she was kind of highlighting for me how our parents were collecting art, but maybe they didn't see it that way. So really kind of the services and active inclusion in trying to get collectors of art, especially from areas, I started the major art markets to perform collection management to manage their art portfolios more efficiently and also just to try and get more people to see artists and as a class. So now that activism is really kind of too full that's around the financial inclusion for those who are collecting art and might not be collecting art and should be or might be collecting art and don't realize that they are and then trying to make the market more fair for artists who may be marginalized by the ecosystem. And it's interesting because yes, there was a panel in Douglas on financial inclusion in May last year, which I was very fortunate to be on and the governor of the central branch of France kind of barked and almost fell off his chair when I spoke about financial inclusion for middle income people. And I think it's and I'm really still resolute around that you know I think people often think about financial inclusion as being for the bottom of the pyramid and it's actually really important to talk to talk about it through the pyramid. So for me would make me happiest if you know there's a collector of African art or any art form which is underrepresented from an underrepresented geography where they take an item maybe to an auction house for auction and because of the information that they've kept on a platform like capital art. They are able to present information like the invoice the details of the provenance the certificate of authenticity contextual information about the artist the artwork because they've been and because they've been collect getting collection reports from capital art as well. They can appreciate you know what's the updated estimated value for the artwork and that can empower them to know what the value for the floor is for selling that artwork. And to arm the auction here with the best information to market that artwork as well as an auction. And I think in many instances the process of a collector's you know exiting their investment doesn't actually play out like that because the artist is unknown to the auction house and so the value of the. The art work is not maximized and it's in that way that I think you know you talk about provenances actually so important that the history of the of the historical significance of artworks is so important because sometimes that's actually kind of really at the moment known by a collector and sometimes it's not known outside of that because of this history of the economic disposition that occurred and you know in the history of South Africa you see it you're very politely you know. There's lots of people who couldn't get gallery represented representation and that often was kind of the avenue where they could then get exposure to many more art markets which would assist with supporting the increased valuations for that artwork. Wow I mean just so many things that I wouldn't pull out of there but the first thing that you talked about was our parents have been collected collecting art and didn't realize it and possibly possibly we have been two and I love this sort of expanded notion of art. We have expanded notion of how we need to think about maybe some of the artifacts that we have as art like the sculptures that we get on the side of the road. How do we you know there's there's so much in terms of inclusion that needs to to incorporate these vendors who sell us these goods which we then bring and you know exhibit in the San Francisco Atlanta Airport I'm thinking of some sculptures. How do they benefit along this this value chain every time the work gets sold absolutely and I think that's exactly kind of the big point about this is you often see you'll see kind of beautiful artworks that people will say are kind of a maybe market to this African art and it's like masks from like somewhere in Gabon and like you'll just see the time says artist unknown. And you know and and and this thing sells for two million dollars and it's sad because then that artist to ever created that doesn't get the benefit of the fact that people now know the signal of the quality of their work and can attribute that same value to other artworks of this by the same artist and by the same creator. And I think that's that's the sad part is yes you know the artist unknown kind of you know label it enables a lot of people to say kind of it's a one so for not necessarily see the breadth of a creator's kind of work and their portfolio and then similarly a trap it should be these kind of high price points that they achieved to other artworks that they have it just means that it's kind of like an outlier just for the benefit of whoever. It happens you have that artwork. You know when I was doing this research you touched upon this artist unknown and one of the stereotypes that I heard in a podcast is that folks who would procure or nations that would procure African art would justify the looting by saying Africans don't have history that this became a certain stereotype. My question to you is like are they any other historical biases and stereotypes of African art and do they impact its valuation and appreciation to compare to other global artists. Yeah that's a really really good question and a really great insights. So you know this past kind of month and February it was you know a big art fair that occurred in South Africa is the Cape Town Art Fair. It's one of the two big art weeks the other being the job of our fair which occurs later in the year and actually I attended that and there was a discussion around kind of the lack of arts education in the current curriculum of many schools in South Africa. And also just the closing down and the lack of public funds or government investment and support for a number of the art centers and art institutions. So we had to have a very big challenge in South Africa not having grown a local collector base and the same can be said for many countries across continent and around the world and actually that was also something that was a whole mock of apartheid in terms of closing down these art centers and actually when restricting the amount of art education that occurred in black communities. It does then play out into how people see art and whether they see artists as a class or not. You know and how artists then passed down from generation to generation and whether the story is about this artwork and what gives a value is also transition from generation to generation or not and I think we don't then value this as a society and then we don't make sure that we take care of it in passing it on. And I think another stereotype the one that you touched on very importantly is this issue of what is appreciated as being various forms of art and what isn't. So the Borghid Lomo collection I think contains tapestry and contains these book sculptures that are painted and often those have been overlooked very much like you say you know you'll see kind of artists who've been creating stuff and you drive past them in the road. And actually you kind of just see it just as that and people kind of then categorize it as craft and not necessarily see it as art and they have that being that kind of a long standing challenge in the valuation and appreciation of African art and our phones from other regions and you know it's been up to for example China to say ceramics are important to us and part of our history and heritage and that's a form of art and for the Middle East to some really say calligraphy and beautiful geographic geometric patterns in ceramic tiles are our forms of art. So that's really important for us and I think in Africa it's exactly the same you know the Borghid Lomo collection contains these beautiful tapestries and actually the you know the naming of it is really important and the one artist who was making these tapestries she put her name on it and that is this act of defiance of saying I'm not going to allow for this artwork to just be relegated to kind of the artist unknown category. Yes, anonymous. I love these acts of activism and rebellion which basically underpins you know the importance of inclusion and I see here as you're talking about provenance for example and the passing down of value through generations. That there is a preservation of the narrative which we previously were not included in even though our art has always been a part of the global conversation absolutely absolutely absolutely wow wow I mean there's just so much to to unpack I mean I have some words for the French person you're on the panel. Yeah, Bob that. Um, I'm they given back. They're loose for is it been in bronze. What is yeah gosh yeah this is yeah one of the big topical debates has been occurring around art restitution and yeah I think it's kind of sad because a lot of the times these kind of are you know items which actually are of very significant cultural value. And you know yes these were seen as art was spoils by some colonialists but actually they're being very important cultural symbols for the communities from which they were taken you know for example like the Benin bronzes in relation to Nigeria the grades of our birds and relationships about. Yes yes that's an anyway my goodness. Yeah and and so interesting because yes in some cases that's not necessarily seen as art by the communities that they've been taken from and it's kind of yeah it's there's maybe then kind of a you know not going fetishization around some of the things that people have found on the African continent that said. Um, I think it's great that more people kind of are taking charge and taking ownership for the narrative around African African art. And actually I think also you know I know there's this topic around you know who gets to call themselves as African and I think anybody you know people do use it often as a short hand for African the African diaspora. And I think it's one of those things where he is if you're from the continent I think just immerse yourself in a few yourself in the definition. You have a lot of life currently but you're going to be like. Yeah yeah we're very situated it doesn't matter I think in include yourself for sure in that conversation and and and you know this like I said it's it's great when we have these exhibitions like you know the exhibition of the Buenido collection and also there's an exhibition at Zai Smokha. The Museum of Contemporary African art in Cape Town called when we see us which is a play on the movie title when they see us and it's great about how to. It was great exhibition just showing the artworks by kind of black people and about how we see ourselves and it's great because obviously yes you know the one thing which always I'm fascinated by is sometimes you will. You know be in certain circles or you will kind of read newspapers and you'll see a picture of Africa which is portrayed and many people when they arrive on the continent they are kind of presently surprised I think there's a tip to go around about this lady who she was expecting to see mud hats and she was very surprised when she saw these beautiful malls in Nairobi you know. And yeah I think black color black figure is a very big theme in African art world at the moment now and but it's great when it's showing the default diversity of the experience rather than kind of the monotone way of kind of looking down on Africa and seeing it as just a. A place for aid kind of a net type of thing I think it's great to show that diversity and I think this is why the people sometimes find it very strange if there's kind of you know somebody starting a startup where they try to kind of create inclusion for middle income people who are collecting art because. It's kind of the thing to do they just find the very strange because they want to relegate you to always having that poverty mindset as opposed to growing middle or upper class. I also just wanted to give a plug to the moa at the Museum of African diaspora here in San Francisco on which I sit on the board that is also doing the same thing and so I love the idea that these museums and these institutions are now talking to each other about how to represent black and African art across the diaspora and redefining what it means to be African and how what it means to exist in our different skin. In our different skin tones without hair types and yes, definitely what we consider art I love that I love that I love that I love that I think we're about to move on to the question and answer portion is there anything else you want to add carvel before we go on to our questions. I'm going on to the questions but yeah I think it's it's an interesting kind of point around where to from here and I know you know we've spoken before about kind of the ways in which to empower and celebrate artists and collected so previously being left out of the art ecosystem and I think that's kind of what the platform is really there to do you know it's been an interesting road as a. As a startup going through the it was in flows of that but the platform I think it's been great to kind of listen to what users have been giving me feedback about and reiterating in that way so now the platform for example has a free account it enables aspiring collectors to sign up and you know also you know they also gave feedback around you know people would sign up and you can save up to three artworks for free and they were like you know you know we've got to take some time to do that and you know you can get a free platform you know we've got to know and you can get a free platform. but I don't know what to collect. And so a new feature that was launched towards the back end of last year was kind of having feature collections and also showing basically the artists that are being collected by a variety of different art collectors and trying to get a variety around that as well. And I was also inspired by I was on an art talk at Art Jobberg and one of the other collectors who was on the panel was talking about how she collected an artwork which is basically 500 red which is the I think the equivalent of like you know $50 type thing or $25. And you know it's also just showing the breadth of kind of collecting because I think a lot of people do have preconceived notions of what is collecting and what is art and it's great to kind of dispelled those notions by showing what you know people who are patrons are collecting and showing the diversity of that. The fact that they're not all collecting these kind of super expensive pieces of art. They're also collecting the things which and trying to kind of support emerging artists early on in their careers as well. Yeah wonderful wonderful thank you. Until our Q&A just want to recap before we go onto our Q&A thank you for just kind of giving us a historical context and the importance of why what you're doing is so important and so groundbreaking even though we are we come from Black African nations but we are as our generation emerges and is educated globally we are the firsts that a lot of people don't realize and thank you for really explaining the importance of provenance and the history of ownership and how we value a different narrative and pass that on to to different generations and so definitely a platform to empower and celebrate some of the great artifacts and artists that we have on the continent globally and I just love this this this pursuit to change the narrative to demand for the artifacts to come back and to really take stock of what we lost in value because we're talking about millions for some of these masks I look like you could have just bought them off the road they have so much significance etc etc all right so on to our Q&A somebody's asking what inspired you to pursue a career that combines both finance and art and how do you how did you initially get interested in modern and contemporary African art? mmm that's a great question so I guess my background has been in finance and I've been a collector since 2012 and so I guess you know I've been I lived in the UK for a period of time between 2006 and 2009 and then moved back to South Africa so I've been probably surrounded by modern and contemporary African art and in all the kind of spheres that I went into because I kind of from around 2011 or so I started attending the local art phase that are here so that's probably how it came to be but you know there's an element of it where it's also about trying to get people to see art as an asset class and then when you start thinking about that that's also the part which I thought was you know gets a bit exciting because then it's just about helping people to understand the extent to which they're investing in art relative to everything else you know when we talk about holistic financial planning that's really important is to kind of look at everything that's in your wealth and then understand what's where and where do you need to be balanced at and that's kind of coming from my background in terms of know what I studied in natural science and around asset management so and then obviously you start thinking about insurance and how important understanding updated values for art is in the context of insurance so that's kind of how it came to be in a way yeah just combining two passions I guess wonderful and just going off of what you talked about you know seeing art as an asset class how do what are the different investment options available to invest in art market and does investing in African art how does that compare in terms of potential profitability and market volatility it's a very interesting question because actually there's a whole bunch of collectors who really hate having the conversation about art and values so it's always fascinating but it is you know there's different ways in which people can invest in art so obviously there's the physical art and that's what most people are familiar with it's kind of you know the stuff that you put on your walls and around you that that looks so beautiful and owning that but there's also a rational investing in art and there's some new platforms that are focused on that one was launched last year that is focused on African artists well specifically and so that's an interesting way of you know sort of yes it really does then look like art like an investment and like I say there's some people who just are aboard that notion but I think it's really great for people who you know maybe want to know that they own like a little small piece of this really well-known artist you know rather than thinking of spending a small amount on an artist who is less than no type thing so I think that's also kind of giving the breadth of it and then there's people who are investing in art in so many different ways when you think about producing art you know actually one of the things that occurred was I provided some funding for an artist to create a fool that was going to be submitted to the Berlin V&R for example so there's ways in investing in art and that way there's people who are investing in it through art phase like I mentioned art gallery starting art galleries starting out different platforms and being at art advisors and assisting with storage and valuation so you know the art economy is actually really really big and maybe we yeah we don't always appreciate it the insurance side the lending side it's I think it's quite fascinating actually so lots of different ways for people to access art and I love that this is a segue into the next question because you talked about it people are used to appreciating art and investing it in the sort of physical sense but this question is what is your opinion on the debate between artists and those who who build generative AI like stable diffusion specifically whether and how credit should be given to artists whose works might be used in data sets consumed by these models I think we have space for all the types of creative et cetera out there I think most people are more kind of mindful of the fact that they don't want kind of to be dute into thinking it's one thing and then it's something else so I think as long as it's really marked that yes you know this is the this is this type of art form it's different to something else I think people just want their transparency so that they can make up their own mind as to you know is this really kind of a painting or was it generated by AI but actually it's just about an expression of creativity so that's why I think it's we should be more inclusive and more welcoming of these new forms of type of art and not be dismissive in saying it's not art because it's also an expression of creativity so I think you know I'm all for it and I think it's just about the transparency that people want it's the same as kind of you know the conversation around chat GPT writing essays for people people just want to know that's really what people really want to know but I think there's there's something to be said about giving credit to the inspiration the the original creator of the inspiration that is used as an input and as one of the you know in the previous class before we're talking about you know inclusive mindset we talked about collaboration and giving credit and so as you mentioned that transparency of giving credit to say hey you know these are one of the inputs they came from here etc etc and as a way to be more inclusive because the idea great ideas are culmination of so many others right absolutely is you know there's the very you know famous example of kind of our 2010 World Cup and the attribution of that song you know to you know incorrect attribution of that song you know the waka waka song so yes I think yes let's remind people yeah exactly yes that's what they attributed it to Shakira me why I agree yeah I'm a friend you you know he was from Gabon and when the song came out he's like no we used to like sing the stony ranks in the army ranks because you know there's kind of yeah you know um times you duty for a lot of people and they said yeah this is kind of the song that we sing in the morning coming from the barracks or you know I find it fascinating just credit do you know what I'm saying yeah the the the inspiration all right I'm going on to the next question um I like this question how has your quantitative training and actual science aided you in building a company and a more creative space hmm that's you know really interesting um because and like I say I know I appreciate that I I love the art aspect of the business but actually as you kind of probably have heard I kind of leave it into the finance aspect of it's also quite a bit um and I try to balance the two because I do appreciate that yes there's the financial value but the cultural values also incredibly significant and and priceless impact so um so that's kind of the way I do it and I think it's it's so fascinating because I obviously get invited to kind of a number of talks um within actual society and a number of actual communities and and speaking about this and I think yeah people are so similarly fascinated but I always say I think actually it's actually very creative people I think people who are in mathematics and engineering you know I know this audience is kind of engineering and yeah I think there's actually lots of creative people in that field um and this is why you know it was important for people to change the acronym from stem to stem to include the arts in it because it's really about um kind of fusion fusion using those expressions of creativity and the work that we do so um yeah in terms of kind of the art I do it because I guess I've always been interested in art and love it and I'm very happy to spend lots of time at art fairs and in art galleries I'm very happy to do that but there's an element of the service and its core about also kind of the finance aspect of it and that's where kind of the actual brain is kind of ticking there yeah do you have a creative outlet and artistic creative outlet I do but well actually I've been I've been um flexing my writing a muscle because I have to write a blog article to get um I had to get right blogs to get paid rent on Google right so I saw your blog you're taking these are kind of found her found her hex I love it she's a she's a she's a writer at night as a woman of color so next question so a woman of color what are some challenges you face in your journey and what advice would you give to young women of color in entrepreneurship hmm that's a really great question I think um it's um the story that is they kind of you know throughout um because um yeah it's you know we're kind of in South Africa actually they used to always say kind of you know black woman face double oppression you know the oppression because of the gender and then because of race as well um but I think it's it's been great to have been surrounded by so many incredible women role models who were maybe doing very different things but it's always still very encouraging um getting sponsorship um from both men and women as well you know um I guess this is the thing that one also has to realize is you know when you have power it's about lending that power to people who and including them and I guess that's also the theme around I'm talking about inclusion and I think I've benefited greatly from you know white men and black who you know far more senior positions who gave me a chance um and allowed me to thrive in in those circumstances so that I think has helped a lot um and I think it's something that I'm quite mindful about in terms of lending that power to other people as well so you know um you know when I became indeed for you know big business units one of the top two contributors to all Michelin and Timber Profit it was also around um making sure I lent that power to also underrepresented groups um in whatever way I could and I think all of us had that duty to do that you know when you get into position of power as to find ways of inclusion as much as you can and I think it's about a delicious space I've also you have benefits so greatly from people who just connected me with other people um and connected me with different spaces and great gave me great opportunities and I think it's you know I tried to make sure I take those opportunities um wherever I can because I think you never know when it might lead to something else as well so I think being open to the opportunities that are out there certainly helps a lot I like that you receive and then you give back um I have a I have a question that kind of follows on this um in the class that I coached teach in the spring I'm a SNE 270 to we had a speaker uh VC from Kenya and he introduced us to the concept of a black tax or discount that black and African founders face when they're raising money now does a similar phenomenon exists in the art world maybe as a woman tax black tax as well and if so how does it manifest? Hmm is that a relation to the startups or to the artworks? um in relation to how they're maybe valued or yeah to the art list let's let's let's let's go with the artists artists um it's interesting in South Africa certainly you see it I mean I attended an auction in November last year and it was start to see artists who are contemporaries where you know one is doing um an artwork which is um paint on wood another one is is also doing another one which is paint on wood and the one um the guide price for that artwork was six times the amount of the other artist and the difference between the two is the former was white and the letter was black and in South Africa you have this history of that that people who were contemporaries um often their art was not as highly regarded and maybe some of it does um result you know it's a consequence of these valuation dynamics that we spoke about earlier but I just think yes you know that is something which is quite sad that that you know still occurring and people haven't re-rated so maybe it is an opportunity um around kind of the fact that you know you should see this re-rating and there should be a middle ground and more um valid kind of comparison of these two artists because they are really art contemporaries um in terms of the quality of the work that they're doing and sometimes they kind of are doing very similar work and it's quite stock that you know the evaluations are not the same but that's all changing I think um you know I actually was just reading a report um from artsy where it was talking about these you know they called them the ultra contemporary artists which are artists born after um 1975 and um that artwork has been really growing and it kind of exploding in terms of evaluations as well um and what they've been able to achieve in the secondary market just because there's so many artists in that category who then just don't get gallery representations so the artwork tends to go straight to auction and so that's actually quite encouraging to see um but that's also underscoring why it's so important to try and make sure that there's kind of local collector bases you know in all these places where these artworks just been generated so that that just can support the pricing that occurs and you don't have these kind of big spikes and and then crashes thereafter because crashes do happen in the artwork world as well yeah well okay we are running out of time and I just wanted to get your you know to wrap things up uh what is your favorite or most impactful art collecting story given the work that you've done like what comes to mind that has encouraged you um I think you know I referenced it so much but I think it's because it was it's really such a groundbreaking collection and that is the the Bungi Lomo collection and what it is achieved because remember like this is basically um an art foundation um which has this benefactor who is a lawyer and businessman basically commissioned Bungi Lomo um to acquire artworks and just make his collection more diverse and and institutionalize that collection because it's actually in an art center that's associated with the university of Pretoria but actually allowed the collection to be named in her name because she's the one who chose all the artworks it's just that he provided the money for her to buy all these artworks but it's quite phenomenal in the context of challenging these notions about you know what is art who are the artists who collect who is our value um and um that's one of the things which just inspires me so much and I know there's lots of people who are doing you know similar types of work um around collecting but it's it's just encouraging because I think it's now you know creating such eminence around a collection which is named off for a black woman so you know maybe because I'm also black woman I just find it really um inspiring and and that's been one of the most impactful stories for me and it challenges me in terms of how I think about my collecting journey um what I want to achieve what will the Karabah Murule collection look like in 50 years time so for sure what will the Karabah Murule collection look like in 50 years now with that we finish up and we wrap things up thank you Karabah for such a fascinating discussion and to our audience thank you for tuning into our last and final speaker of the Winter Entrepreneural Thought Leader series even though this was my first our spring series will kick off April 12th where we'll be joined by Deb Lio the CEO of ancestry.com and you can see our spring speaker schedule on our Stanford Econer YouTube channel and as always thank you for tuning into ETL the entrepreneurial thought leader series is a Stanford Econer original production the stories and lessons on Stanford Econer are designed to help you find the courage and clarity to see and seize opportunities to learn more please visit us at econer.stanford.edu
