 You are listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. It is my sincere pleasure today to introduce our very special guest. To some of you, Jeff Hawkins might be a household name. For those who don't know who he is, let me give you a little bit of background. Jeff is the founder of Palm, Palm Computing. In fact, he loves to joke that I'm still carrying around my Palm 5 and my purse. If anyone wants to see a collector's item, I've got it with me. He also is a founder of Hansbring. And that would be enough, right? To found these two really terrific companies. But beyond that, Jeff is also an avid neuroscientist. He has taught himself how the brain works. Can you believe that? And he is basically so talented in this area that he wrote a book called On Intelligence. For how many of you have read the book on intelligence? It is terrific. I love it. As a neuroscientist myself, I would tell you it is really, really wonderful. And in fact, Jeff now started a new company just a few years ago called Numenta. That is building software based on the theories that he proposed in his book On Intelligence. So without further ado, I'm going to invite Jeff up here to tell us his story. Oh, OK, thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, Tina. A couple months ago, Tina asked me if I could come and give this talk. And I said, did I give this talk once before? And she says, no, I thought I did. You gave it twice before. And I figured it took the two times I had nothing new to say. But you're a new group of people. And I haven't slowed down my career too much. So I have some addendum material that you can add on top of things in the past. So it's a pleasure to be here. Before I get into my normal, normal remarks here, there's nothing really formal about it. I'm going to talk about my career and my experiences as an entrepreneur and some of the lessons I've learned. But I have no pretense that those lessons necessarily apply to you. Entrepreneurs are as different as there are many of them. And what worked for me and what's important for me may or may not be important for you. Your miles may vary. So I just want to let you know that because I'll be talking at certain toads and about things and you have to just take what you can. So what I thought I would do today is I want to talk about entrepreneurism and my experiences with it. But I'll do that in the context of my career. And I will go through the whole thing and tell you along the way some of the stories that you might find interesting. And then at the end, I will sort of sum up with some sort of lessons learned and put them in that context. And we'll have some time for Q&A as well. So let me just start being. I graduated from college 30 years ago. This is my 30th anniversary from getting my W.E. to get a Cornell. And unlike all of you guys, when I went to school, I had no idea what I was going to do. I had no aspirations about what I was going to do when I got out of college. I had certainly no desire to be an entrepreneur or design products or be an neuroscientist or anything like that. I really just was going along for the flow. And I became a double E because that seemed like an easy thing to do when I fathered on it. And then I took my first job at Intel because, well, it's a growing company and I could get to work in Oregon. That thought that would be cool. So that was my first job. And three months after graduating from Cornell, a major event happened in my life. It was basically I read a magazine. I read the September 1979 issue of Scientific American, which is all about the brain. And every story in it was about the brain. And the last story was, and by Francis Crack of DNA fam. And Francis wrote a story. He said, he's called thinking about thinking. He said, well, you've probably read this issue of Scientific American and all these things about the cell and the neurosgenesis and business. And he says, well, let me tell you something. We have all this data, but we have absolutely no idea how the brain works. And basically, what he said is there is no theoretical framework in which I understand his ideas. So if you know, it's funny when it's a young kid. If you didn't read that, you wouldn't have noticed that. He would have said, oh, we're cool. We understand how this thing works. He says, no, we don't understand it at all. And at that moment, I said, well, this is something great. I can work on this. I think I can make progress on this problem. And I decided to dedicate my life to understanding how the brain works. I also realized at that time that if you could figure out how the brain would work, you could build machines that work on the same principles of it. So that got me really excited too, because then you could have more applications for and we could turn it to a technology and song. So I said, OK, I'm going to do this. I have my life plan here. I've been very passionate about this. The first thing I did, what do you think? I'm working on Intel. I write it out of the Gordon Moore. I said, Gordon, Intel makes memory and they're making computers. I think we should study brains so we can figure out how they work. Then we can build computers that work like that. He passed me on to a guy named Ted Hoff, who was one of the early founders at Intel. And Ted was one of the guys who had a long history of neural networks. And I met with Ted Hoff. And he said, now I know all about brains in neural networks. He says, you're never going to do this. It's never going to succeed. So don't try. Now, that was a little disappointing. Imagine a 22-year-old kid writing Gordon Moore. And then getting rejected and so on. I'm still working on Intel. So I just tried some other things. So I said, well, I can't do it here. I talked to some other companies. They weren't interested. I said, well, I'm living in Boston at the time. And I said, well, I switched from Oregon to Boston. And I said, let me go to MIT. So I said, MIT has an AI lab. And they're interested in building intelligent machines. Therefore, they're going to be interested in how brains work, because they'll help them build that intelligent technology machines. So I went in the interview there and I applied to the AI lab as a computer science guy. And they said, well, we're not interested in brains. I said, well, brains are just messy computers. And there's nothing to be learned by studying brains. Now, some people are snickering. But trust me, this is the prevailing thought back then. And I fell, oh, they're definitely wrong about this. But didn't matter. I didn't get into MIT. So I'm really getting kind of bomb. So I keep working along in the industry here. And I said, I have to do, and my career was going well. Actually, I joined a startup company called Grid Systems. I was founded, but I was 30th employee or something like that. And Grid invented the laptop computer. So now I'm working on mobile computers in the first laptops. And my career is going very well. I'm doing well. But I said to myself, I got to get back into brains. So I decided to go to graduate school. I said, how am I going to do it? If I can't do it in the computer world, I'll do it on the neuroscience world. You couldn't study theoretical neuroscience. So I got myself into a biophysics program. I became a PhD student in biophysics at Berkeley. And I quit my job in the computer industry completely. I said, I'm getting out of the computer industry. I'm giving up seven years. This is 1986. I was giving up seven years of work in the computer industry. And so I'm just going to become a graduate student. And so I did that. And I started off at Berkeley. I'm commuting an hour every day to get there. And I wrote a paper about what I want to do for my PhD thesis. And I had some of the ideas later appeared in the telepathy. And I wrote this paper. And I submitted to the graduate, chairman of the graduate program in neuroscience at Berkeley. And he had the faculty meet it. And we got together. And they said, this is a really good idea. It was a great problem. You want to work on. It's really good ideas on how to do this, but you can't do it. And I said, what do you mean I can't do? He said, not only can't you do it here at Berkeley. You can't do it anywhere. Because what I wanted to do was a theoretical mathematical approach on understanding how the Neocortex works. That was the specific thing. And they said, there's nobody doing this. And as a graduate student, you just can't do what you want to do. You have to work for a professor. I was naive. I didn't understand this. That you couldn't study whatever you wanted to study. You had to work for somebody to study. And I was really bummed out. You got to imagine how bummed out I was. I had this major soul searching. I said, what am I going to do? So I start spending all my time in the library of Berkeley, just reading science papers just before the internet, of course. So if you want to read papers, you've got to go to the library. And I had a big bill in my photocopy car. And I was reading all these science papers. And I said, look, I've got to do something else here. So I said, what do I do? I put a plan in place that I've been playing out now for over 20 years. The plan was I'm going to go back to work in the computer industry. And I will do four things. One thing I was going to do is I was going to mature. I was going to learn how to make institutional change. I think if I'm up against institutional barriers, I have to make institutional change. How do I influence people? How do I get people to change ideas? And so on. I'm going to work on that. The second I did, I wanted to make a name for myself. I said, well, I have to be, if people respect me, they might listen more to me. The third thing I wanted to do is I wanted to make some money. Because I needed to afford to be able to be a student again. I'm starting to have a family. And I said, in the future, I may have to pay for my own research. I may have to do various things. I don't know what that's going to be. It's going to take some cash. And the last thing I said, well, the neuroscience community would mature. And so that was great. Now, again, I'm not thinking like being an entrepreneur. I'm not thinking this at all. I'm just going to go back into the computer industry. So I went back to my own employer grid. And I came back in sort of an entrepreneurial role. I came back to design a new product, which I proposed to them when I was gone. And I brought them in a little property with me. So I had a special licensing deal. That was the way I was going to make some extra cash. And I went and created what was the first tablet computer we called the grid pad. And I learned to build a manager team of people. And this all went great. It went just on plan. Everything sort of worked out well. I became really well-failing on that one. The computing industry talked a lot of conferences. We introduced this product. It was very exciting for the year-old to young to know those, or most of you, to young those. But there was this huge bubble of pen-based computing back in the 1990s, in the year 1999 and 1991. And so I was in the middle of all that. And then I said, OK, four years, I'm going to go and go back and do my neuroscience thing. Well, then another problem, unexpected thing happened. And I got another, oh, these people hanging out outside. Do they want to come in? No, they don't want to come out. They just want to stand out there looking through the window. OK. That's all right with me. They can hear me, I guess, isn't it? Sounded out. Yeah, it sounds great out there. They just want a particular view, I guess. So something happened. I was working on these tablet computers, and then I got this other second bug. You know, I got the neuroscience thing going. And the second one was, I realized that in the future, that everyone's going to have a personal computer that fits in their pocket. That that would be the primary computing device for everybody. That you would be accessing a pocket-based computer more often to be accessing anything else. And that this was inevitable. It was going to happen, but I could make it happen sooner. We could do a good job at it. And I got really excited about doing this. And so now I have these two passions. I got one through the mobile computing thing. We'd say the future of personal computing was mobile computing. And then I had the neuroscience thing. And I had to decide what to do. So I said to myself, all right, I'll just go do the mobile computing thing for another four years. And I put the neuroscience thing off for a little bit longer. And this is where I ended up starting my first company. Now, I'm what you would call a reluctant entrepreneur. I have started four corporations. One was a non-profit. I'm going to tell you about that, too. So Tina mentioned three. In each time, I was reluctant to do it. Each time, I really didn't want to do it. And I'll tell you, I'm being honest about it. You'll see why. But so what happened was I started talking at industry conferences about the future of personal computing, being mobile computing, and how you can design these small things, and what it's going to be like. And you got to imagine it was pretty hard back then, because at that time, there was no technology to do this. There was no good battery technology. There was no low-powered CPUs. There was no good small displays. There was not even good packaging technology. No one was doing anything with wireless. The internet didn't exist as a consumer phenomenon. Nobody had cell phones. To say that we're going to build these mobile computers that we're going to be doing all these things, we didn't even what they're going to do yet, the people weren't listening to music or watching movies on their computers at that time. It sounded kind of crazy. But I thought, whatever's going to happen is going to happen. So anyway, I was approached by a couple of VCs. And they said, we'd like you to start a company. And you think, wow, wouldn't that be great? I said, a whole lot. I don't want to do that. And the reason was, because I saw a lot of other people start companies. You know what happened? They worked like dogs. They got divorced. They sold their house. This looked like a miserable lifestyle. And I'm not into that kind of lifestyle. I don't work weekends. I don't work long hours. And I'm like, I don't want to do that. So they said, oh, we'll help you. I said, OK, I only do if you really help me. I'm going to do promise. Here's what you're going to do. And blah, blah, blah. I said I'm going to hire someone to run the company. But I don't want to do it right away. They didn't believe me, by the way. They thought that I, they thought my VCs thought that I really did want to run the company. And that I was just kind of going, wait, trying to convince them. I really didn't want to run the company. And but I said, all right, but it's worth it, because it's a cool idea that we're going to build these mobile computing devices. And that was going to be great. That's how Palm got started in January of 1992. And now, like a lot of startup companies, Palm had its problems. It almost went out of business. Its first products were a complete failure. We partnered with Casio and Tandy and some other companies in America online and so on. It was a total mess. And we had this product called the Zoomer, which came out the same time as the Apple Newton. So we were the second fiddle to the worst product ever. And you know, so it's really been a Casio versus Apple. And Apple fails. Casio is not going to do anything. So that's our situation. But you know what? We had $3 million in the bank. We had 27 employees. Our investors, all except for one. Our investors said, this is a failure. We're getting out of this. But we had $3 million left. We couldn't raise any more money. So we said, OK, what are we going to do? And we said, let's keep going on. We're passionate about mobile computing. Let's do it. Let's try to figure it out. So we went back and we interviewed all our customers who bought the Newton and bought the Zoomer and so on. We said, what did you want the signal to do? And they said, well, I wanted to be a paper like my organizer, but synchronized with my assistant and so on. So we listened to these people. And we said, OK, we're up against paper. We're not up against computers. We're going to make an electronic organizer. That's a hand-to-computer. And that was what came to Palm Pilot. We developed the product at $3 million. We couldn't have enough money to bring it to the market. There was no way in the world that anyone would fund us even though we were on the verge of having one of the most successful consumer products of all time. So we actually sold the company for $44 million, which some people thought was like, miraculous. How did you get that amount of money for a failed company? Other people in high school said, oh, my god, you gave the company away. But anyway, we sold it to U.S. robotics. And but the entire team stayed on because we're still passionate about this, this mission of mobile computing. So there we were. The company went through a series of acquisitions. It was now being owned by 3Com. 3Com was mismanaging it. Now, guess it. One thing I should tell you, when I started Palm, it was in my employment contract that after four years I could go do neuroscience. It's there. I have this book. I mean, when you do a founding of a company, they give you these books, the document, all that you'll see if you ever found a company. A book with all the documents in it. Mine says I can work on neuroscience. So four years, we were into it. The Palm was being very successful. I was now working part-time at 3Com slash Palm, doing my neuroscience. And then we were having these sort of management difficulties with the senior managers at 3Com. And one day, my business partner, oh, I just got the mention. I did hire the CEO. Her name was Don DeVinsky. And I hired her six months after we started Palm. And so I've been working with her for many years. Anyway, so one day, Don walks in my office, she's Jeff, we just resigned. What do we just resign? She says we just resigned. She says the two of us? Yes. So now I was really mad at her for resigning for me. But you might not realize why. I took me a while to realize it. Because the reason we resigned or she resigned, and the reason I was mad is because we basically felt that Palm was going to fail under 3Com. It was going to be driven into non-existence. And then we didn't want that to happen. So we were trying to argue that they spend the company out. They argue we will never spend the company out. This is Eric Venom. I will never spend this company out of 3Com. And we said, well, you're going to kill it then. Therefore, we have to leave. And we'll have to start a new company. So we basically resigned to start a new company, which was handspin. Well, guess what? When you start a new company, you can't work part-time anymore. My neuroscience dreams were fading away from me. At the moment, Donna walked in my office and said, you just resigned. And I'm like, what do you mean, no? So I said, oh my god, I've done another four years. So actually, we agreed that I would work full time for two years. And then I'd be able to start working part-time again. And that's what happened. And then, at handspin, we designed the 3O smartphones. And then both Palm and handspin had their successes and their failures. They both went public. Eric Venom did spin out Palm eventually. And so I had two companies go public. And then they went in the hard times. And then they merged together again. And I don't work at Palm anymore. But they're still in business. And now they've got some great new products that are coming out with. Now, what happened was, eventually, I got to do my neuroscience thing. And about seven or eight years ago, I said, OK, I'm really going to go do this now. I said, what am I going to do? And I have a bunch of neuroscience friends. I don't just work in a closets in place. I'm known in the neuroscience community. And I said to neuroscience friends, and they said, Jeff, if you really want to work on neocortical theory, there's only one way you're going to do it. He says, you can't do it at any of these institutions. It's not going to work. You can't give money to people because they won't do what you think you're going to do with them. So you've got to do start an institute that just focuses on neocortical theory. Now, imagine this. A guy with a bachelor's degree in AA, putting up a shingle saying, Jeff's neuroscience institute, come on and come on. It was going to work there, right? I mean, this is a crazy idea. I said, who's going to work at this institute? I said, I'll only do it if you help me. And if you got to be on the board and you're going to help me, you're going to bring people here and you're going to help craft this thing. And they said, all right, we'll do that. And I said, all right. Now, let me tell you, starting a nonprofit is just as much work as starting a for-profit business. You've got all the same issues. You've got money issues, you've got building issues, you've got people issues, you've got missions issues, you've got all the same kind of stuff going on. But we did. We started the Red River Neuroscience Institute, which was a very unusual institute. It was a single task institute focused on neocortical theory. We had 10 people working there. I ran it for three years. 10 people working there. Now, three years, we had 120 visitors from around the world. It got to be a hot place. It got to be the point where neuroscientists around the world were saying, how come I haven't been invited yet to R&I? And we actually had a lot of success there. It was a very unusual way we ran it. But I ran a sort of a combination of corporate and science. So the scientists could do whatever they want. But I put some sort of structure around it where everyone had to go to journal club and everyone had to do this. And we picked topics to study collectively and so on. Anyway, we worked on the neocortical theory. We made a lot of progress on that. And what happened was eventually we had so much progress. I had to decide what to do next. So we started. And what happened was a friend of mine, who was a colleague, Delieb Droid, who was at the time, a graduate student at Stanford. He was hanging out at R&I. And he basically was following this theory and read a really copy of my book. And he basically figured out how to take these theories. These biological theories and turn them into a mathematical formulation and show that we can make it into software. And so Delieb basically, and I've been talking about this for so many years. And he's showing how to do it. And I said, all right, what do you want to do? And he says, I'd like to start a company on this. And I was like, oh, great. Another company. And I said, there's a lot of work starting a company. You sure you want to do that? You said, yeah, I said, now at this point, I couldn't back out. Because I've been talking about this for 25 years. And I said, we're going to do this. And now we're doing it. And I can't say no. And I really did want to do it. But it's not like, oh, wonderful. Let's go start another company. It's like, oh, it's a lot of work. So we started the event four years ago. And that's what we've been doing. And we're having success there. We're still in the development phase. But we have a lot of interest. And it's very cool stuff we're building. And I can talk about it in the Q&A if you want to ask me questions about it later. So those are the four things that I've worked on. Those palm, the four things I started at palm, and then hand spring, then the Red Renewer Science Institute. By the way, that was a successful start too. Because it had the equivalent of an acquisition. I had to do something with the institute after we had sort of success with the theories. And I didn't want to run anymore. I mean, it's really a miserable managing whole bunch of scientists. For me, at least, it's not my thing. And now I did have someone running. It was me running it. At palm, and hand spring, I always had Donna being the CEO and Ed being the BP marketing and so on. So what am I going to do if I'm on an eye? The Red Renewer Science Institute. So we basically, we had a great association with Berkeley. So we moved at the Berkeley. It was acquired by Berkeley in some sense. And so it continues now on the Berkeley campus. You may say, why didn't I do it at Stanford? Didn't we think about that? Because we were right around the corner here. Turns out that it was very difficult to work with Stanford. This is off topic here. But Berkeley and Stanford are very different in the way they handle this kind of thing. At Stanford, the individual PIs, and we have a lot of friends who are scientists here at Stanford. They work independently. It's called Pillars of Excellence. At Berkeley, they're managed as a group. There's a Helen Rolts neuroscience institute which run by someone called Bob Knight. So as an institution, I can have an institutional relationship with Berkeley. But I couldn't have an institutional relationship with Stanford. And I talked to the provost here and so on. It just didn't work out. So it was no way for it to really sort of establish that sort of institution, sort of give and take, which we had with Berkeley. So we moved all the institute to Berkeley and it continued on there. All right, so that's kind of the major phases in my life. And we're now still doing the Neumannth thing. And I actually actually got a fifth thing I'm starting recently, which I really regret having a fifth thing. But it's so exciting. I'll tell you that in a little bit. I thought I would just now sort of turn this into some sort of the lessons that I've learned here. Is that all right, Tina? Am I doing all right? Okay. I even wrote some of them down so I don't forget. But it's the random recall, which is hard. The first thing is, let me just talk about it, it means to me an entrepreneur. It means things, different things to different people. I actually like the definition Tina had in her book, which is, I'm going to paraphrase it here. It's something along the lines of an entrepreneur, someone who finds problems and they look for creative solutions and creative ways of solving that problem. The everyday vernacular of entrepreneur is something different. Every day of an entrepreneur, I'm an entrepreneur, people say, oh, you started a company. Which is not the same thing. And if you say you're like a serial entrepreneur, it sounds like, you know, some sort of criminal or something, you know. You start a multiple company. I don't think there's a badger courage, by the way. If someone calls me a serial entrepreneur, I kind of feel like cringing about it. It's like, what? I couldn't get it right the first time. I have to keep trying over and over again. But I have a good excuse. It's like changing jobs. I have a good excuse to, I went through here, why I started these different things. And, you know, it wouldn't be my brothers to do it that way. But anyway, so, so my definition is a little bit similar to Tina's. Basically, what I did was I said, if you find something you're passionate about. And this is what is all in my life. You find something you're passionate about. I've had these two passions. One is the neuroscience, the one is the model computing thing. And then an entrepreneur is someone who follows that passion, no matter where it goes. No matter where it takes you. In my case, it wasn't necessarily, oh, start a company. It was like, whatever I had to do, if I had to go to graduate school, I had to go to graduate school. If I had to sell my company at Palm, we sold our company for, you know, for $44 million. So that we could finish launching our product. And that was success. It wasn't like we had to go, you know, keep it independent or something like that. You have to make, give up ownership of things. You have to be able to do whatever it takes. And that's, to me, that's what it is. You have a passion and you follow wherever it takes you. In my passion, my neuroscience passion has taken me 30 years. And I'm still at it. And I hope I, you know, we're going to get to the end of it soon here. But, you know, whatever it takes you. And that's to me what entrepreneurism is. And you can, part of it, maybe starting a company. Part of it may be going after your old company. Part of it may be doing something else. But it's not just like starting a business. I know a lot of people who sit around and they say, OK, we're going to start a business. I've seen this over and over again. I said, what do you, what are you passionate about? What are you going to, oh no, we'll figure it out. We got the team. We're going to figure it out. Well, some people succeed at that. But a lot of people don't. Because what happens is when you, when you create a new company, let me tell you, you know, bad things happen. It always does. Always, always something, you know, you'll have crises. And if you're not passionate about what you're doing, you just won't have the stick to theness to get through those bad things. I mean, it sounds fun and hindsight. It's always successful. Let me tell you at the moment you're doing these things, it's miserable. All kinds of crises, there's a curve, all kinds of problems. Everything looks like it's falling apart. This is all successful companies. All go through this. Trust me. And you better really care about what you're doing. You have to be able to passionately get up in front of your employees. And please don't leave me. Here's why we're going to succeed. And we're going to get through this crisis. And blah, blah, blah. So it really takes that kind of passion in my mind. And if you don't really have that, then when the crisis is happening, you're just not going to do it. Another thing is I think there's a little personal pet peeve in mind. It took me a while to understand this myself. There's a belief that being an entrepreneur requires it's superhuman effort. Super long hours. People say, oh, you must work really long hours. And I said, well, no, I really don't work really long hours. I don't like working long hours. I work. I can't go all the time. It's not like I play games and stuff. But I don't like sitting in an office and I don't like traveling. And throughout the years that I all my years that I've worked, I had this rule. I'd be home for breakfast and dinner for my kids every day. And I would try to minimize the amount of travel. Now, not everyone can do that. But I was in a situation I could. And I used to worry about it. And one day Donna Dobinsky sent to me, I said, Donna, really, the engineers are all night long trying to get this release out the door. And I'm going home at 6 o'clock. And he says, you know, Jeff, don't worry about it. He says, you know, everyone makes their own choices. Everyone has their own point in their time in their life. This is what they want to do. You want to do right now. And you can be effective without having to work hard. And part of that lesson is that success is not necessarily just about working hard. It's about making the right choices, the right decisions. I like to say that any company in the world, the local Starbucks, the local vacuum cleaner store, could be the largest company in the world. If every day they make a better decision in their competitor. If one decision has better than their competitor, every single day, look at Nokia, the largest self-manufacturing in the world. Do you know what they made for 80 years? Now how did the rubber boot company become, you know, the largest telecommunications company in the world? Well, one of the largest. Well, I guarantee somebody they were smart and made a better decision every day. They didn't do it by just making rubber boots faster, you know, harder. They made smart decisions. And so anybody, any company, be turned into any size if you just continue to make better decisions. And that's really the key to success. When you're confronted with problems, you have to make a decision about how you're going to solve that problem, which path do you take, and making the right decision is the answer, not necessarily working really, really hard. The third thing, and I've already alluded to this a bit here, is you really need to, in my case, I found it very, very helpful to get support from people. Involve people in your problems. So many entrepreneurs sit down and say, okay, I got this idea, I'm going to keep it secret. Right? I can't tell when people come to me and they say, like, all right, I want your advice Jeff, you're a successful entrepreneur, I want your advice, but I need you to sign an NDA, or I can't tell you what the product is. What are you crazy? I said, you should be telling everybody in the world, you should be telling everybody what you're doing. You're trying to get anybody to listen to, you should be happy about that. My favorite story, and I'll probably get in trouble saying this on tape, but anyway, a good friend of mine is Dean Cayman, brilliant guy, and really amazing guy. I don't know if you know him, he's a incredible inventor, and he was a guy who invented that wheelchair, and this infusion device from Diabetics, and he also did the segue. Well, before the segue came out, Dean called me out, and he said, Jeff, I want to come talk about a new product. So he brought this whole team from this new company, which was unnamed, which turned out to be segue. And they showed up in my office one day, like eight of them. And they said, okay, Jeff, we're going to grill you about how you introduce a consumer product. And I said, okay, what's the product? Can't tell you. I said, well, what category it is in? We can't tell you. I said, can you show me anything about this product? No, we can't tell you anything about the product, but we want to know, key is the success. I'm like, well, they said it's going to be expensive. Oh, great. That's really helpful. So I couldn't really give them any advice. If they just told me, they're here, like it's a two wheel thing like this. I've got to have a whole bunch of ideas. I would have said, you know what, you're going to have trouble here, you're going to trouble here, this is what I do here, is what I do. I have all these other ideas. As soon as I saw, I said, Dean, you should have told me this. But people get wrapped up in secrecy. And now when people write to me, they say, well, I have these great ideas. I'm not going to sign you in here. You're lucky if I look at your business plan. You know, these days, nicely. And I'll give you my advice. But you should, you know, don't be secret about it. You want to involve as many people as possible. Now, there's some exceptions that, of course, if you're getting close to launch, and you have a particular product, you can't say what it is. But in general, in the beginning, you want to end this people. The other thing is you want to get, as many people helping you as possible. I already mentioned the VCs. When I started working with VCs, I said, you guys are on my team. You're going to, I need to be able to call you every day. I want you to answer my call every day. I want you to come down here and we've got problems. And they did that. If so many entrepreneurs think, oh, it's me versus the VCs, I've been going to tell them this, I've been going to tell them that. What you really want to do is you want them to put as much money into your company. You want them as much as possible so that they are worrying more than you. Because you want them to say, no, well, my God, we're going to lose this whole thing. It's going to fail. I can't let that happen. I've got to work on it. If they don't know what's going on, if they don't have enough money, then there's a screw it right off. So you really want to involve them. And again, also involve other people in the team. I've been very lucky to have great people supporting me and working with. So I've worked with Donovan Skett, all my things I've created. She was even on the board at R&I. And she's now a volunteer part-time CEO at Nementa, which is a wonderful thing for her to do. But I've had always spread the pain. One of the things I learned early on, if you're an entrepreneur, you start a company, you're invested. Only have one thing they can do. Do you know what that one thing is? They can fire the CEO. That's the only thing they can do. That's their only point of control. So why do you want to be the CEO? Let someone else be the CEO. Let's see. As soon as I hire a CEO, they can't fire the technical founder guy. They can fire you the CEO. But if you're not, they're not going to fire you. They're going to fire you the CEO. So all kinds of burdens will lift their off your shoulder at that moment. You're like, great, I can like. They're not going to get rid of me. And that's not a joke. That's really true. And so think about it that way. So you want to don't be secret. Get people involved. Get many people. People worry about too much about ownership, too. And I'm like, oh, how many times I've heard of this? I don't want to give up more than, I don't want to give up control of the company. I'm 51%. I'm like, what do you care if you're 51%. 51% of nothing is a lot less than 20% of something. And another thing I've learned is that as much as you think at any point in time, this is the stock option that's really going to make me wealthier or whatever, it's always the next one of the next one of the next company, the next thing that makes you wealthier. It's always more later on. So worry about your passions. worry about being successful with that is all kinds of good things will happen. If you sit around worrying about ownership or control and all this stuff, you're just not going to have a good time, you won't be very successful. And it's this whole idea of just following your passion gives you guidance at any point in time as to what to do next when you're doing those things. OK, I took a little bit less time than I was supposed to take. I'm a cantina like don't get mad at me. And I'm going to answer questions now from students. We've had students, if you have any questions, I'd be glad to do that. And don't be bashful. I'll call on you. Yes. So at one point, in product instructions, there's sometimes another vision for product. And then there's a lot of maybe days here for people who are cognizant. Yeah. In one product recently that I saw from home with the bully area. Yes. And I felt like that was a precursor to the netbook revolution that's sort of going on right now. Yes. So the lay sort of the impression that that was potentially a really good product. So you can be a comment about that? I would repeat the question. I would repeat the question. So the question has to do with the product that was I was recently involved. That the last product I was at recently involved was called the folio, which was announced by Palm, but never shipped by Palm. And the observation was it might have been like a precursor to the netbooks. And so that was it. The folio, for those of you who don't know what it is, it was a silly, it was never launched. But it's like a netbook. It's a small computer of that. It's solid state. It's always on. And it was very simple to use. And it synchronized with cell phones, automatically, and email, and things like this. This is a product I conceived many years ago. And I still, to this day, think it was the best product concept I ever had. And it was too far out there at the time I thought about. When I thought about it, I said, this product will make sense when everybody has a smartphone and people in some future world. But it wasn't there yet. And so he said, I just put it on the shelf for a long, long period of time. And finally, when Palm and Hans being merged back together again, I got them to agree that we're going to do the folio. I said, look, it's a good time for it. It's going to be a great product. Now, there was a couple of things that got in the way of the folio. One was that I was no longer working at Palm full time. I was only there like a day of week. I was doing R&I. And so I was trying to sort of like inspire the team, build this thing without being there day to day. And I didn't know how well that would work. Well, it didn't work as well as it should have. So the product had delays. And I didn't have the right sort of driver person behind it all the time. And I couldn't play that role. The other thing that got in the way the folio is that Palm started having financial problems and difficulties. And then they did this semi-raise a whole bunch of money through elevation partners, those are semi-leverage biotype, I think. And they brought a whole new team of people in, and they had put a different product strategy. That was happening just at the time we were launching the folio. And so we had to choose what, we're going to launch this or not launch it. We may be changing directions, but we don't know yet, so we can't really delay it and so on. So that's why it was announced, but then it was never shipped because the new team came inside that didn't want to do that. Now, in hindsight, you could say, hey, it was just like the netbooks. And maybe it's a good piece of the economics. Probably is. Although I can tell you which one of the netbooks folio got right. But at the time, very, very few people thought this was a good idea. Very, very few people inside have even palm photos a good idea. And when I was very interesting, we announced that this conference called D. And all the interesting pundits there said, this is the stupidest thing in the world. Some of the people call it like Hawkins' folly. But the people who weren't the pundits, there's a whole bunch of people who are just like users or computers, they loved it. They said, that's what I want. I'm so tired of these big, confusing computers that batteries don't last. I'm so hard to use. Oh, yeah, look. They said, after all, it's like simple. That does email and web browsing. And that's all I need. Right email, web browsing, right? Maybe K is a presentation. That's what I want to travel, people travel. And so there was a whole undercurrent of people who were not the technoradi who loved the idea, but the technoradi people were like, well, don't know. This is not. It's not wireless 16D7, whatever. And so it's a little bit. It was very sad for me that we never actually launched that product, actually shipped it. And I think if under different circumstances, that would be a hugely successful product now for them. But it's different circumstances, and we can't worry about it. And it's behind us. And I'm happy to see that the netbooks are sort of coming on. And I think the idea of simple, small, low cost, easy to use computing is a good idea. And I have a Dell laptop. And it's unbelievably complex. I don't know if you guys have problems, even the Macs are like this. Let me tell you. They're just so complex. It's just not a product for the world. And you need simple computing devices. So that's where the mobile stuff is really coming to play. Anyway, it's an interesting question. And the best product idea I ever had that never actually got shipped, unfortunately. Yeah. We heard a lot about the successes that we have achieved to support. But it would tell a little bit about the mistakes we made in the first half of a carrier. I did a long time successes. I'll talk about all my failures. Sure, you want me to talk about my failures, right? Then I mentioned the palm almost went out of business. But yeah, let's see. I've probably designed like a dozen computing products. And I would say two are really successful. And maybe six were reasonably successful on a bunch of duds. I'll tell you my first failure. My first failure product was interesting. I was at grid. We had done the tablet computer, right? Which was a stylist pacing. We were selling it to commercial people and churned to adjusters and things like that. And then Microsoft decided that this was a new area. And they created windows for pen computing. Whenever Microsoft saw a new area, they just would say windows for that area. And that would be it. And it still did that to this day. I don't know what to say. So they were creating all this kind of fun and you know, fear and certainly down and all this kind of noise. And so I had this idea. I said, look, I have a great idea. I'll create a convertible notebook type. It was a laptop. It was like a convertible laptop, which is what we see today. It was the very first one. It was actually very nice design. It was called the grid convertible, actually. It came out in like 1990, 90, 90, 90, 90, maybe something like that. 81. And it had this display. I think a laptop with a display kind of was facing up. And then it would have this like double hinge. It was really cool action. And it had a keyboard. And so you could use the styles with the keyboard. And so it was a regular laptop plus the tablet computer. So we could sell it to our tablet customers. And they wouldn't have to worry about Microsoft and all this kind of stuff. Well, it was a well-executed product. It was beautiful design. And I thought it was a great idea. And it was a failure. And the reason we learned it was a failure had to do with the fact that in the laptop market, people didn't want any compromises. And so they basically, when you pick a laptop, some people say, I want a thin, I want a this, I want this, so this, and we were offering this one product. And it didn't fit for everybody. And it was a little bit thicker. And they just didn't want that combination. So now it's interesting. So years later, when Microsoft and apparently Bill Gates got so excited about doing his tablet computer, I'm saying myself, this isn't ever going to be a big business. And because I knew, and here really, it isn't. Now, they did introduce them. And they've sold a bunch, but they hadn't really taken off. I mean, the tablet, the convertible laptops, have not been a big market. The incredible amount of money and effort put into it, but very few people haven't. Has anyone in the room have here one? A convertible laptop? No. So when they made this launch, or the Microsoft made the launch a whole new convertible stuff a few years ago, I said, this is going to fail. I've been there, I've done that. The, I'll give you other failures. The zoomer I mentioned was the first product of palm was a failure. The first product we did at hand spring was the interesting failure and success. Two failures into success. I'll tell you why. This was the hand spring visor. The visor was a low-end, fun, colorful pdf. And it had this feature called an expansion slot in the back to call the springboard expansion slot. So you could plug in radios and all kinds of cool, we did see plug into the thing. So the visor was a huge success. We sold millions right off the shoe. We had two failures with it. The first failure was we were a pioneer in online retailing. We said, we're going to do this online retailing stuff, right? So we created an online retailing website and we designed all thing. And we got a gazillion orders literally the day first day. I mean, we announced this visor and we were taking in tens of thousands at hour of orders. Now, the system kept up with it, but the system got confused. And it mixed up all the orders. And we started shipping wrong products to people. We'd people who paid us, we didn't ship many products. People who bought one product, they'd get three. And this was a disaster. It was a total disaster. I could do some less kind words on it, but let's leave it that way. And so what do you do? Launching your company, launching your product, everything is falling apart. You got customers who paid you money or getting charged over and over. You haven't done any product. And people go, wrong product. I mean, you know, people, thank you for sending me three. I only wanted one. So what we did was take everyone in the company, including myself, everybody. And we took a list of everybody who ever bought a product, who ordered. And we called up everyone individually. We said, did you get the product you wanted? And they said, no, I got three. I said, you're happy? Yes, keep them. I said, the next person, did you get the product you wanted? No, I'm furious. I haven't gotten any. I run it. I said, I'm going to send it to them all. And we did that for every single customer. And call them everyone. And we got through that. That was a big mistake. And then the other thing was the, when you start a company, I just mentioned earlier, always have like, crap hits the fan. When we started hands-pins, something's going to happen. I know it. Something's going to happen. Some bad's going to happen. And we didn't anticipate that was it. But that was it. We said, all right, something happened. Then the other thing was interesting, fairly about the advisor was this Springboard Expansis slot. Well, actually, we promoted it. We got people to build these things to plug in. It was very cool. We had people like pedometers, various types of radios, and pages, and so on. It was very successful. All these companies built these Springboard expansion modules. However, they didn't sell any. People just didn't want to buy the expansion models. They just bought the visor. And they just, they like the idea. People like the idea of expansions. Oh, I really like the expansions like them. We said, did you buy any expansions like? No. I like the idea. So that was a failure. And we had the some point. They said, back, we're going to abandon that. Even though we promoted it as this big thing. We had to say, up, get up on that. So that was a bit difficult. So there's always this kind of stuff going on all the time. I can give you more failures if you want to hear more failures. But I would say if you're badding 300, you're doing great on a product design stuff. Every third product is a success or something like that. Yeah. I'll take this guy here. We talked a little more about the teamendom projects. Yeah. Can I talk a little more about the menta? Sure. I love to talk about the menta. Not you giving the excuse to talk about the menta. So again, what the menta is based on, we have this theory about how the New York Cortex works. And by the way, the theory is getting a lot of good play in the neuroscience community. So it's not like this stuff's making the stuff up. And I have, you know, it's pretty legit. And it's pretty clear. This is how the New York Cortex basically works. And I won't go into the details of that, but it has to do with the memory system, it's hierarchical, and it uses time. So now, what does the brain do? When you're born, you don't anything about the world. You don't know about Stanford, you don't know about books, you don't know about tables, you don't know about chairs, you don't know about cars, you don't know about computers, you don't know about entrepreneurs, you don't know a language, your brain has a few things in it, but mostly attempting. And you have to build a knowledge base about the world. You have to build an act of effect on a model of the world. So when you, from the day you're born, you, through your senses, start building this model of the world. And the model includes what things are out there, how they interact, and so on. Well, it turns out the way the brain, the New York Cortex builds this model, through vision and hearing and touch, it's all the same. This turns out there's a common algorithm underlying most of the high level senses that, and how they represent in the New York Cortex. So that's why you can learn a language through vision, like sign language, you can learn it through, auditory, you can learn it through written. And this is basically the same algorithm going on. Well, we kind of figured out what this algorithm is, we know how to do it. So what can you do with this? We're writing software to emulate this memory algorithm, this hierarchical memory algorithm, and you can apply it to different, all kinds of problems. Any problem, we have a lot of sensory data and you're trying to build a model, and then you can do inference on the model, meaning you can do pattern recognition. So we have all kinds of customers who are trying all kinds of things, where it's starting to work with the bankers looking for, how do we detect problems or fraud, fraud detection and bank transactions. We're working with two car companies. One is trying to do a better visual sense, or trying to detect, there's a law in Germany, that detect children, independent of people, adults, and so on. They have to have a camera that can actually tell, there's just a child, there's a bicycle, something like that. We can do that. We have another car company that's, that's interested in putting an array of sensors around the car to model traffic around the car. So it built a sensory array of light, or these are radars, and do that kind of thing. We have people doing medical imaging. It's all over the map. But all of them have lots of data. They don't know how to process the data, but they want to do, they want to build a model underlying the data, whether it's a visual model or bank model. And they want to do inference. Here's a new pattern. Can you tell me what's going to happen here? People doing network analysis, power networks, and internet, things like that. So we're trying to turn, we're basically, it probably used to say, the future of mobile computing, the future of personal computing is mobile computing. And that, eventually we say, the future of computing is a hierarchical temple memory. It's a whole new way of thinking about information processing is the way brains do it. And I am convinced that given enough time, it will be as big as a computer. The field of turning-based computers is today. It's a really fun amount of the idea that nature has discovered. And we're just trying to build the very first computers. It's like we're building the eniacs of H-champ, something like that. I mean, it's very cool. Maybe if you're interested, we have internships available. We're just moving to Redwood City. And we also, I don't know if we have any more openings, but we have a workshop in June 20th, but you can come to. One day workshop, it's a cheaper student down in San Jose. And we're introducing a vision kit and all these other things we're doing there. So it's a very cool technology. And our website has a lot of information. Everything is up there. You can look at it all. So that's Numento. Yes? You said you were starting at 10. Oh, yes. Well, I thought, you know, it's not. It's an easy thing. I got a new idea. I've been puzzling them on this idea for years. And I just got to the point I have to do it. And I always, again, I would kind of regret it. Like, oh god, why don't I think of these things? Because it's a lot of work. The, this idea is a combination of my handle computing and neuroscience. It's an off-shoot or something called sensory substitution, which is the idea that you can learn to perceive things to different sort of substitution centers. One guy, scientists, Bakery Rita, came up with a little camera. And he put on a blind person. And then he put a little griddle on his tongue. And it innovated the picture from the camera, innovated the ray on the tongue. And the person who had the camera in the head initially feels this on their tongue. But eventually, they start perceiving in a distance. They start perceiving like it's an image. And so that's the idea of sensory substitution. So I figured a way of doing the ray practical device for blind people. And it has to do with a handheld thing, you hold your hand, you use a 3D camera, and essentially can detect the distances to edges. And it transmit those edges to your underside of your fingers. And so instead of using a white cane, you can just sweep this thing across the floor. And you can very quickly determine that there's an edge out there, or there's a discontinuity. And then by turning your hand sideways, you can tell exactly where it is. And you start to feel at a distance to your hand. And I've got a whole bunch of offsets to it. But the idea is you could create this thing. And I think it would be a, if you go look at what people, blind people do to navigate, it's very poor. They have very poor tools for this. They don't really, they have the cane. They have dogs. That's pretty much it in people. And I think you could create a very rich sensory experience for blind people. And so we're trying to start this. Now question, how do I do it? I've said I'm not going to start a company. That's it, done. So we're trying alternate approaches. I'm working with the design from IDO, Dennis Boyles, a friend of Tina's, and David Kelly was one of the founders of the D-School here. And we're looking at trying to do this in a sort of a nonprofit open source way, an open source hardware in software. So we're going to design this up to a certain point. And then we might do some sort of competitions for people to come up with business plans on how to bring it to market or how to improve it. And so on, we really haven't figured out yet. If you want to work on it great, let me know. We're willing to fund it. And we just want to have it happen. I mean, that's the goal. We want to have it happen. We want to build this thing. We want to get it out there. And it would be just really cool to do it. But I'm not going to start a business. I think I say that now. I'm going to stick to younger looking people first. So that's OK. This one, I'm back here. I'm sorry. Here you go, too. So I'll come back here. I was wondering how you got involved with it in the first phase for the poem. And also, how did that influence the product? I had a funny story. The question was, how did I get involved with IDO for the poem? And then how did that influence the product? Let me tell you a funny story about this. So Ed Colligan, who is now the president of the poem and was the VP of Marketing at Early On At Pong, we were starting to work on the Palm Pilot. The Zoomer was a failure. We were starting to work on the Palm Pilot. And he said, we had $3 million in 27 people. And all those people were softer people, except me. I was the only guy with any hard work background. And so we said, Ed, we have to build a physical piece of hard work. We need an industrial designer. We said, oh, yeah, the guy's an IDO, too expensive. So Ed takes the yellow pages. You know, you guys know what the yellow pages are? He takes the yellow pages. And he opens up the industrial design firms. And he gets parallel to design. They are clawed up. So he calls up this company called parallel to design. There's these two guys, Malcolm Smith and the other guy are in parallel tone. And they're like this kind of like, well, at the time, they were, I don't want to say this in a derogatory sense. Well, it wasn't the high-end shop. Let's put it that way. You know, two guys, Luigi, you know, I will build something for you. And so we started, we originally did design a parallel to design group, really on the cheap. I mean, we paid them in stock. And it was like, we have no money. We were designed this for us. And they did. Now, when we came around to doing the Palm Five, and this is very interesting story. So we had done the Palm Pilot and the Palm Three. And we were being very successful. And Microsoft decided that they were going to kill us. They literally had Steve Bomber got up. He talked to you last week, right? He got up there in front of some sales conferences. You know, these guys, Palm, they put a big circle and I like the target. You know, we're going to kill these guys. We're going to kill these guys. So I started getting these condolence notices. I mean, literally, you know what I'm saying? So I'm sorry, Jeff, you know. What are you going to do? And like, and then Microsoft is creating this thing. What was it called? The Windows CE thing I thought it was called. But it was like, you know, PDAs for, oh, not the great story. They started using the word Palm and we sued them and got them to stop it. Anyway, so we said, what are we going to do? And they started saying it's all about the software. It's all about the software, because that's what they did. That time Microsoft just did software. And we're going to have 25 licensees. And it's all the software and these Palm guys are dead, right? Because all they're doing is hardware. They're just one vendor hardware. And we were having pressure, by the way, from other people to basically give in to Microsoft. And I said, no way. They said, we can compete. I said, what we have to do is we have to do what Microsoft can't do. I said, Microsoft can't build a beautiful product. They don't build products. They build software. And that's not even very beautiful. But they don't build the product. I think at least time when these guys build the product, I said, so we're going to build a beautiful product. And that was the generous of the Palm Five. I said, that's the most important thing. Now, I was interested in saying, what we did at that time is we could afford to spend some money on them. And not that idea was too expensive. But they're a high-class shop. And some of them were going to engage to IDO. And I'd worked with some of the principles earlier at Grid in a company called Matrix Design, which was then folded into IDO. So I knew about them. And I ended up working with Dennis Boyle and a team there doing the Palm Five. And it was a great product. It was beautiful. It was super successful. Now, I'll tell you an interesting story about this. Well, we were designing the Palm Five. Really one of the most successful consumer products of all time. There was a lot of pressure to put new features in the software. Because Microsoft was piling on all these features, which really were important. But they were piling all these features. And I said, look, if we put a lot of new features in the software, then people will not pay attention to the industrial design. They'll have the reviewers will say, Palm introduces four new features. Microsoft features is 45 new features. We lose. So I said, if we have no new software features, they can't write that story. Well, they can write it. Palm introduces a beautiful product. Microsoft products still look awful. Right? And that's what happens. I had to fight this huge battle internally. Because, oh, they're not doing anything. I said, well, trust me on this one. We just got to focus on the beauty design. That's the whole thing. It was elegant to all around. Not just the physical beauty, but the way it worked and so on. And we just focus on that. And that's what we did. And we just blew them out of water. They were 10% marketing. And we went without 5% Microsoft. It was very, very successful strategy. And anyway, as we started working with Ideal, and occasionally we would work with them, depending on the product, because they're really good at certain things. But if you're doing a quick turn of a product and something like that, then you don't really need to use them. But they were great for bringing totally new ideas. That probably, the Palm Pi was the first product ever to have a lithium-ion battery in it. It wasn't removable either. And no one was comfortable doing that, because there's no one I'd done it before. And so everyone said, oh, we can't do this. We can't do this. Why not? We went and visited the battery manufacturers. We talked to them. They were uncomfortable. But it couldn't tell us why it wouldn't work. And then we did some tests. I did some tests at home. I said, I'll take a bet. It's going to work. Meaning that it wouldn't burn up, and it wouldn't die. And it was basically that the battery life would be suffice for the life of the product. And so that was the first time that I was ever done. It was also that probably had no screws in. It was glued shut. And this was to make it look pretty. And there was no reason to open it up. Since you're not going to take the battery out. And at the very last moment, the manufacturing guy's got cold feet. And they said, oh, my god, we can't glue it, because we can't glue it. That's too dangerous. What if they leave it on the dashboard? And it gets hot, and then the glue melts, and it opens up, because it's a thermoplastic glue. And so they were going to reset the launch of the product by about four months to redesign it with screws. And so this is where your passion comes into play. So I go in there. And I said, what do you mean? There are reasons. There are four months. We can't afford four months. And so I said, tell me the problem. And I basically said, I went back to my childhood. And as a child, they worked on boats, and we had shops. I practically lived in a shipyard. And I worked with glue a lot. I used to have 55 gallon drums, and polyurethane foam in my kitchen. And so I'm not joking. So I said, I know glue. There's a glue that'll work here. Let's get to me him on the phone right now. We're going to talk to the one person in the world who knows what glue to use here. I think I have the right clue. And we're going to ship this thing. Well, they did. And it worked fine. It was never a problem with the clue. I'll take one more. I'll come on with it. You'll be patient. All right. But maybe go ahead. I was supporting you. You talked about how you've tried to have other people at the CPU. And if one of your CPUs were in the room white right now, and somebody asked both of you keys to success of your company, keys to entrepreneurial success, what would be the biggest difference between your answer to the question? Working with the CEO, pairing with other business partners, if we had my, basically, I've only worked really one, which is Donna the Binsky, and now Ed Colligan a bit. So two people really, but mostly Donna. What would be, you were asked me, what was the keys to success? How would we answer it differently? Well, I don't think we would answer it differently. I don't think so. I think, I've been very fortunate to have a very complementary relationship with my business partners. And three of us ran Palm for many years. Ed, Donna, myself. And we had complementary skills. So I was the product guy. I was the person who could say the glue's going to work. And design things like that. Ed was the marketing guy. What's the message? How do we present this to people? How do we do testing of the product? And Donna was the business person. Like, let's not defend all the money. Make sure we have some money left over to design the next product. And how do we build the company, and so on. And so we had complementary skills, but was also keys. We knew A, each three, all three of us, enough about the other person's area of domain to be able to comment constructively on it. So I know enough about all the aspects of running a business to talk about the finances, talk about the manufacturing, talk about the legal aspect. And Donna Ed, no, enough about products. It's the challenge me when I say something. But it's like, he and his about T-Shade. I love that. T-Shade people. And when I first read it in your book, I really resonated with me, which is meaning people you have to have a little bit about everything. And then you have to be really deep in something. So what worked for us is we were three T-Shade people. And our vertical line offset from one another. And I don't think we'd come up with different answers. There is no formula for success. I'll leave this in my last comment. There is no formula for success. Basically success is solving one problem after another. That's it. And the problems are always different. If they've been solved before, then you know the answer. But you're presented with a new problem. Online retailing, it's falling apart. We see 100,000 units in the wrong people. What do we do? How do you respond to that? And so now competition for Microsoft, how do we respond to that? So it's always about just tackling these problems one and another. And you just need a well-rounded team who can bounce these ideas off one another and try to come up with a good solution to it. And again, if you can come up with a better solution to the problems, then you're a competitor. And you do that consistently. Your company will never end success. All right, I'm going to end it right there. So thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
