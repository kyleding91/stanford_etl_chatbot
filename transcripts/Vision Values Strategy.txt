 You are listening to the Draper Fisher-Jurvinson entrepreneurial thought-leader seminar, brought to you weekly by Stanford Technology Ventures Program at Stanford University School of Engineering. Today, where our guest is Rick Wallace, Rick is the CEO of KLA-10 Core. I think one of the most interesting and exciting companies in the semiconductor equipment space and perhaps in the valley. A company that has been enormously profitable and successful over the years, maybe not one that is a household name like some of the others. But certainly I think one of the ones that's really part of the backbone of the valley. Rick has been the CEO there since January, so he's new on the job. I'm sure there's some interesting insights now that he's taken over that job. Rick's background is an electrical engineering, so he's an electrical engineer from the University of Michigan and has a master's degree in engineering management from Santa Clara University. What he wised up and came over to Stanford's executive education program, so we're glad to have him as well. Connemies alumni here as well. So let me turn it over to Rick. Thanks for coming, Rick. Thank you, Kathy. Thank you all for this opportunity. I'm going to talk about a couple things regarding KLA-10 Core. I will touch on vision, values, and strategy, and then obviously being a position to take questions. Let me just start with who we are. As Kathy mentioned, KLA-10 Core might not be a household name. The company is 30 years old. We were founded in 1976. It was a venture-backed enterprise at the beginning, and I'll talk a little bit about that. We are based here in the Bay Area in San Jose, and we make equipment for the semiconductor industry. So anyone that manufactures semiconductors will have our equipment in their facilities in order to inspect and measure their product as they're building it. We're focused on those two fields, inspection and measurement, and I'll talk a little bit about why we chose that and why we think about it as we go forward. Do we change our strategy? We're bigger than, right now, we're a little bit over 2 billion, probably about 2 and half billion dollars in sales this year, and we're 70% of our sales are outside of the US. And this becomes a very important factor, especially as the company goes forward. Most of our business is now in Asia. For Silicon Valley, there isn't Silicon in Silicon Valley anymore. The reason this is called Silicon Valley is because the semiconductor industry really grew here. But today, in fact, very few semiconductors are made in the valley. And so for companies like ours, we have to be very globally minded because our customer base has moved primarily to Asia. We have a large market share in the markets that we serve. We're 2X, our closest rival, and our closest rivals are some very formidable competitors. Natachi is one in applied materials as the other. And both of those are people we pay a lot of attention to to maintain that position. But our strategy, and I'll talk about this, is to have performance leadership which leads to large market share. Our market cap is somewhere north of 9 billion dollars. And we have 5,500 employees, about 3,500 of whom are in the Bay Area and the rest are throughout our different facilities around the world. We do sales and service in probably 22 countries. But we also do engineering development in places like Israel where we have a facility. We do some development in Russia. We have development in Taiwan. We have a development center in China. We have activity in Singapore and we have a large development activity going on in India right now. And our basic value proposition is we enable Moore's Law. And Moore's Law is the continuing adding in the capability and doubling the number of transistors on a semiconductor every 18 months and at the same time reducing cost at about a 30 percent per annum. So the reason all these applications, consumer applications are becoming available to you and why iPods make sense and cell phones are getting more capable and cheaper is because semiconductors continue to get more productive. And so our job is to help people find the defects that would otherwise cause these devices to fail. So we say you can't fix what you can't find. And they're getting more and more challenging. We're finding defects on the order of 30, 40 nanometers. So we're well into nanotechnology. And these defects that matter get smaller every year. And so our tools have to get more capable in order to handle them. And you can't control what you can't measure. So in one case we're trying to find flaws. And in the other case we're trying to measure parameters whether it's the thickness of films or the width of lines or the registration as the device is being built over time. So we make inspection and measurement equipment. This is one of the early products we made. I think we sold it for about $150,000. Our customers thought that was really expensive back in the late 70s. I'm not sure what the bill of materials, in other words how many parts were in it, but my guess it was on the order of 1,000. This is our latest of the same technology serving the same kind of application. This tool has 72,000 parts. It has 10 million lines of code and it sells for about $25 million. And they still think it's too expensive. But the challenge is as technology has evolved and people are trying to make smaller and smaller semiconductors, the defect and the challenges associated with finding and fixing those has just gotten more and more challenging. So our technology has to match. Now, only that we have to be ahead of the technology because we have to anticipate what's coming in two to three years. So that's a little bit about who we are. I want to switch topics and I'll come back to more about KLA 10 core. But I want to talk about three areas here. What is the idea of why a vision is important? I did a little market survey before this class and I talked to a number of you about why you're here and what you're looking at doing. And a lot of people, there are going to be a lot of startups coming out of this class. That's what I got from that. And it makes a lot of sense that this is the hub of entrepreneurialism and companies like ours have venture funds where we end up funding startups because some of the great innovations come out of those. But also I'll talk about innovation coming out of companies like ours. But as a company, no matter whether it's smaller or large, you need to know where you're going. You need to have a sense of vision of where you want to go. And it needs to be well understood throughout the whole enterprise. And you'll be amazed in how many companies that doesn't happen and people aren't sure about where the company is going. And it's harder to get alignment if you don't have a common vision. The second one is your sense of values is what guides you. And this becomes more important as companies become bigger. It becomes important if you're thinking about how you want to run a company. But also if you want to join one. My view is if you're not in alignment with the values in the company, eventually you're going to have a problem. And on the other hand, if you are, that will be a good fit and that becomes very important is to share the values with the other people that you're working with. And strategy, of course, there can be very different strategies. But the essence of it is what makes you unique and why will people buy from you? I'll talk about that a little bit on the next slide. I certainly think about these three constituents. And I think everybody starting businesses or entering them needs to recognize there are multiple constituents and they are not the same. Shareholders are certainly different, or investors are different than customers which are different than employees. But they all matter. I used to ask this question in internal meetings. I would say which of these is the most important. And of course, the finance people would say shareholders. And the sales guys would say the customers are. And the HR people would say employees are. And it's a bit of a trick question because you can't ignore any of these constituents, whether you're private or public. And the essence of this is shareholders, they want to know why they should invest in you. Whether you're private or public, why should they put their money in you? And that's about a financial transaction. And what they want to earn in return for that investment, it has to match the risk associated with the investment. So obviously, if you have more risk, people are going to expect higher return potential. And as companies get more stable, and this is measured, as you all know, it's measured against very safe investments like T-bills. But there are needs are different than customers. Customers are going to ask, why should they buy from you? They're going to have choices. And we think a lot about that at KLA-10 Core is why should customers buy our product? How do we meet their needs going forward? And how do we make sure that we secure the market shares that we've enjoyed? In most of the markets, we serve, we're probably somewhere on 70 to 75% market share. And the reason we're there is because we anticipate what customers needs and we develop solutions for them in anticipation of what they're going to need. We also charge, typically, have premiums in pricing. We get anywhere from 20 to 30% higher prices than all our competitors. And you can only do that if you provide unique value. But the other constituent that's very important is employees. And why should people work for you? And clearly in a very small group, then perhaps everybody has a large share of the equity and their different motivations. But as any enterprise gets larger, this becomes more and more important. And especially in fields like ours, which are high technology, the only real long-term advantage you have is your people. Because they're the one that create the new products. And so to ignore your people is to lose your competitive edge. Competitive edge. And a lot of companies have done that. And that's why you see companies that go up and come down as they don't understand that they have to motivate their employees. There is a trade-off that you have to make. And in my job, you can try to pretend that you can optimize all three, but the reality is you are making trade-offs. And the things that you would like to do for your customers or your employees might not be beneficial to shareholders. And so you have to be mindful of that as you manage the company. And clearly you want to take a long-term view, but you do get pressures from shareholders that aren't so long-view. A long-term. I'm going to walk you through a little bit of history on the company. This is a revenue graph from when we started the company. I shouldn't say we. I didn't join until late in here. But when the company was started, it was back here in 76. And this is the revenue. And you can see we're at about 2.2, 2.3 billion for 2006. The other thing you'll notice is the cyclical nature of this. And this reflects the fact that semiconductors is a very cyclical business and equipment is also cyclical. This was the 2000 bubble that some of you might not remember. But I'm finally forgetting. And we finally exceeded the revenues there. But you can see the growth rate has been very steady and solid. And it has been profitable. I think we've had 15 straight years of profitable quarters. So we've managed, even through the cycles, to continue to be profitable. But I want to walk you through some of these decisions. It's not just to tell you about KLA 10 Corbitt, just give you some thoughts for your own. One of the first one on here is the question of focus. When Ken Levy, the KLA, founded the company, he had a business plan. And it had two businesses on it. He was going to do mask inspection and masks are the things that go into lithography tools that image the devices and semiconductors. And they were done manually. And he thought, you know I can automate that. But I also have a plan to do bloody analyzers. Similar kind of technology, both image processing. And the great thing about this thought, Ken, was I can diversify my risk. And I can be in two markets and they're kind of off-cycle each other. And it'll be great because he'd been in the semiconductor industry, equipment industry. He knew that was cyclical. So he want to have a balanced approach. Sounds like it makes sense, right? So it goes to 146 investors before the first one says yes. There's another lesson in that. 146 times people said no to the business plan. But for the first person said yes. And when the first person said yes, what do you think they told them? Pick. You can only do one. And the reason you can only do one is because you need to focus. You need to focus on what you're going to do. He picked mask inspection. He thought he had a great plan for blood analyzers. But the VCs were smart enough to say you need to focus. It's going to be hard enough to do a startup. And so the lesson there, at least for me, and I'll come back to this idea, is you do need to focus on where your energies are. The second one in, number two here, and revenues were still very small back then, was the idea of charging for service. Up until this time in our industry, service had been given away by the people that sold equipment. The rationale was the new sales paid for the service. And he wanted to change the business model because he viewed that service would be a drag on the P&L. And the idea of charging for service would create a new business and a newity inside of the business. Well, he's trying to get an IBM, sell the first machine in IBM. Sales guy goes up to IBM. It's February. It's Burlington, Vermont. And the guy calls back and says, can I get good news and bad news? Good news is they're ready to buy. You finally cracked IBM. Now, IBM at this time is 25% of the market. They make their own equipment. It's a huge accomplishment. He'd never sold anything to IBM before. And the sales guy's going, down side is they were not going to pay for service. It's not going to work. And Ken says, hold up there? And he says, yeah, it's February, Ken. You got a coat? Put it on. Leave. He didn't want to take the business unless he got the service contract because he knew once he gave away the service contract, he would never get another chance to sell it to IBM. He got the service contract. And the rest of the companies then followed. And the rest of the industry then followed. And I'd say arguably change the dynamics in the equipment industry where service became something we charged for and created a huge annuity stream. Today we do $400 million in service a year and it's profitable for the company. And it continues to grow. So the point on this is when you make decisions and you make them early, they can have dramatic impact on where you're going. And you have to have the vision and the sense of what are the things you're willing to trade off? What are the risks you're willing to take? And are you really willing to walk away from business in order to make your model work? The next one was we were in mass inspection. We had a radical inspection. It doesn't look like much. It takes years for it to matter. It's over half of our business today. It takes a long time. You have to be patient. When I bought a machine from the company it was in here and I bought it a wafer inspection I was a customer and I came in and they said, well, what are you going to do with this machine? Wow, it would be good if you know what I was going to do with the machine. They didn't know. They couldn't find an application but there was a lot of willingness to stick it out and perseverance to stay in it. And ultimately it took off and created a lot of the value of the company today. The next one was this risk taking. We had two technologies. We had the next generation that was going to be ten times better than the old product. And then this wild idea in the corner which was going to be a hundred to five hundred times. Fifty people on the next generation, five guys on the one beyond that. And we were at a point where we were about to ship the product, the next generation, they called PITAN to IBM, once again IBM. And big debate as to what we should do. And at the end we had a debate and said, well, there's one group of thought that said, let's ship the product that we have, the next generation. It still work on the future one. So once again, very small group, and this one I happen to be involved in, made the decision not to do the next generation, but to burn the ships and put all the bets on the longshot technology. Because our belief was if we ever ship the next generation product, we would never do the other one. It would be successful enough that it would drag us in, customers would like it, we would be left supporting them, and there wouldn't be any bandwidth left to do the long shot. And the long shot is what ended up driving this revenue up to over a billion dollars. I'm very confident if we hadn't done that, we wouldn't have grown the market. We would have kept kind of doing what we did, but it was a dramatic change in the company, you sometimes have to take a bet. The next one was this idea, number five shows in line versus offline. Short story on this is we used to sell one per fab, and the idea was how could you sell multiple. And everybody knew it was a good idea, and I was running a pretty good size organization at the time, and my boss comes to me and says, I want you to focus on this inline option. And I said, well, I got a team doing that, I think it's great. He goes, no, you don't understand. I think you should focus on it. I said, right, it's part of our responsibility, mine. No, no. You should quit doing everything else you're doing, and only do this. And it didn't feel like a choice at the time. That was my deal. And I was right, and I'd been to the company, my career was going well, but my view was now I had a chance to kind of blow it. If in fact this didn't work, I would have failed. Nobody likes to fail. On the other hand, I had to work on it. There was nothing left to do. I had no other constraints, and they threw one other one at me. They said, don't worry about the budget. So you take away the two constraints people typically have, time and money, and you don't have any excuses left. And for me, and we've done this again and again inside the company, is how do you get people to focus? How do you create an entrepreneurial environment inside of a big company? One of the things you do is you take people that are high potential, high performance, and say, this is all you're going to do. And we're going to incentivize you. I mean, you're going to get your win if this wins, but that's your job. And we're going to take away your excuses. It works for me. We were successful and drove this. And if I look back on my career and how I've been fortunate at my career, it was that was the tipping point for me. It was being assigned to that job, which at the time felt phenomenally risky. But my point is even inside of big companies, there are these opportunities. And what you really want, whatever kind of environment you're in, is to be exposed to the big opportunities. And the ones that look difficult and scary, and to work without a net, to burn the ships, pick your analogy, pick your metaphor. But I think for me, it was the opportunity, just this is what you've got to do is you've got to drive revenue. The next one is number six, ten core. So KLA and Tencore, KLA Tencore used to be KLA and Tencore. I know the name just rolls off your tongue. But they used to be our archentiment. Our archentiment. I was a general manager before we did the merger at KLA. And my message to the team, I want to keep it simple, is make ramp. We're ramping a new product and beat Tencore. And that was kind of it. It was a bumper sticker, make ramp, beat Tencore. And then we merged. The most amazing thing happened to me in that merger is I had maintained very good relationships with the people at Tencore. And my message to all of you is be very careful how you treat your competitors. Because you may well on the same team. And you just don't know how things are going to progress. And it doesn't mean you don't want to win. And doesn't mean you don't want to compete as hard as you can. Just remember, you don't know how things are going to play out. One of the luckiest things I did was to have developed good relationships with the people at Tencore, who then suddenly we all got pushed together. The reason we got together was applied materials, who at this point was not in the market, bought two companies in Israel. And suddenly the bad guys at Tencore looked a lot familiar, then worrying about applied materials entering our space. So you don't necessarily know how it's going to end. And in that case, this was the catalyst for a lot of the growth that we've had. The last point on this is when I became CEO at the beginning of this year, one of the focuses is on a new strategic plan. And there were a lot of questions we had to answer. And I'll talk about some of those in the next couple of slides. One was we had to come up with this vision again. And this looks simple. And it should. And to our employees, it's extended as the world's best inspection and metrology company, differentiated solutions and customer experience. Sounds like motherhood. Pretty obvious. Except there was a raging debate inside the board of directors at the time about whether we should get into process equipment. So we did inspection and measurement, but there's all this other equipment called process equipment. And so the fundamental question we had to ask ourselves is were we an inspection and measurement company or were we a semiconductor equipment company? And it sounds like a subtle difference, but they had huge ramifications. Inspection and measurement meant that we weren't going to go compete head to head with the likes of applied materials. And we were going to go inspection measurement and other segments. If we said semiconductor equipment, then we're probably going to do acquisitions inside semiconductor equipment. And suddenly we're going head to head. And my view was we couldn't be the best in the world if we did semiconductor equipment, but if we stayed in inspection and measurement, we could be the best. And it was more important to be the best than to be the biggest. And from that standpoint, let's do what we do really well. The other key point is differentiated solutions. There was an idea at this time that you could go and lower your costs and our customers are driving costs. And shows should we be a low cost leader? And one of the guys on my staff says, look, if we're doing it in Silicon Valley, it better be daring, dumb, and different. It better be innovative. It's not about low cost. Now you have to drive down cost, but we said we want to do differentiated solutions. We do not want to be a cost leader. We want to have premium pricing with premium performance. And the last one is we knew we had to improve our customer experience. The philosophy of the company early on was it was better to be needed than to be liked. And the idea was you create products that people really needed. Well, over time, that doesn't work. The industry gets more mature. You have to make the experience of working with you to be one that customers are positive about. The next one was this idea of values. And I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this other than to say, you need to have something that guides you, your management team. And for me, the values that we as the management team, we had values on the wall when I took over the CEO job. Everybody inside the management team said they didn't represent us. And so these are not the list of values. These are the list of our values. And they might not be true for other people. And frankly, for us, what matters is what's true for us. Perseverance was one. What we look back in our history is we're in 19 or 20 product lines. Every one of the product lines at one point in time somebody wanted to shut down. Every one. And we just stuck with them. And the reason ultimately we won was because we stuck with them. And so what we learned about ourselves is we don't give up easy. We have to have perseverance. It goes back to when the founder went and heard no 146 times, he went to the 147th. So we keep plugging away. So we want people. The reason values become important because they tell you the kind of people that you want. If people don't share your values, they probably shouldn't be on your team. The drive to be better. The industry we're in, Moore's Law, incrementally have to keep improving. So for us, we want people that deal the urgency. Whatever you done lately, not what did you do in the past, but you got to keep earning your key. The third one is our industry is too complicated. Our products are too complicated. We're too global to not have team players. We used to be okay with people that were just stars. You got to work on a team. You got to either be able to lead a team or be on a team. We went and did an off-site and came up with these values. I came back and a lot of people, a couple of senior guys go. And I said, I think you're great. I think you'll do really well just not here. And the reason is because they couldn't be on a team. One on one off and became a CEO of a smaller company. That's fine. That's great. It was more for me about having the right fit, having the right, the people that shared each other's values. This is an interesting one is the idea of being honest, forthright, and consistent. Saying what's on your mind. We used to have a lot in the company. People would manage the information. You get bigger. They're afraid to tell you like it is. My view of that is management gets what they deserve. If people tell you bad news and you shoot the messenger, they're not going to tell you bad news anymore. But eventually it's going to come out. So my view on a lot of these is they start at the top. You've got to be willing to recognize that if you want people to be honest and forthright with you, you've got to be that way with them. So I came, we had an executive review. We review all the businesses quarterly. And one of the general managers after we rolled these out came in and he had his chart of numbers which was plan, forecast, and then he had the HFC column, which is what he really thought. And the numbers were different. People used to manage the information which you wanted is people to tell you what's really going on. And last, indispensable, and this is one we debated as a team, but in the end for us, we want to make products that our customers can only get from us. We want to be indispensable for our customers. The best, the highest satisfaction point is when people tell me we couldn't have done this without you. UKLA, Tencore, the only way we were able to solve this problem is because of your capability. Those are the products we want to build. We don't want to build the lowest cheapest commodity. We want to build products that are technically differentiated where we're indispensable. The other part on strategy was we said we focus on core semiconductor, but we will extend outside into other fields. And so we're starting to do acquisitions. We're looking at way to extend inspection and measurement beyond what we do today as a growth strategy. But the other thing we said, we're in 19 businesses. We'll only play in ones where we can win. And we were number one in 17 of them. But one we weren't and we said we couldn't win and we were against a touchy. And they had a product that satisfied the market and the market requirements weren't changing and we shut it down. Because we said if we can't add value there, we don't want to play. So part of strategy, the essence of strategy is often what you're not going to do. You can't do everything. You have to make these strategic choices about what you're going to do and what you're not going to do. The last slide I have is on the three constituents. And this is kind of my vision if I flash forward a few years, FY10, how does it feel from each constituents perspective, from shareholders, from our customers and from our employees? My vision is that our KLAC, our sticker on the NASDAQ, the people will think we're a great investment because we've outrun the market. We've outperformed the market. We've done better than their other investments. And they'll think that our business model is good. We have high gross margin, low operating costs. We continue to make money. We have integrity, top and bottom line growth. We'll grow not just revenue but profitability. And companies like ours, they get valued on your profitability. It's not just revenue growth. We've got to grow bottom line faster. Customers that they'll view us as we help them succeed. And we do that by having differentiated, in a great inspection of metrology solutions, not just point by point, great products but also broad portfolio of them and that are support and how we support our customers. And lastly, that our customers, our employees will view that we're a great place to work because they feel affiliated and they're inspired. My experience has been when people leave companies, it's because of their boss. And when they stay, it's because of their friends, all else being equal. And so you want to create an environment where you have responsibility for the people managing that they understand. That's their job is to create an environment of affiliation and inspiration, personal growth. Most of the people we employ, virtually all, are professionals. Most of them four year degrees at least. So they want to grow in their careers. My job, our job, management team is to enable them to grow and enable them to continue to take on more responsibilities, to have the opportunities that I had. And then lastly, the idea of rewards and recognition. Clearly, I think money is a motivator for people I've heard some of you when I talked to you before, hopeful that you make a lot of money in a startup. But in the end, I think for a lot of people, money isn't really a motivator. Money's not a motivator. It'll be a demotivator if you're not treated fairly. In companies like ours, it's much more about fairness. Fairness relative to their contribution relative to others and relative to what's available on the outside. Now startups make more because the risk reward profile is very different. Some startups, for every YouTube, there's a lot that don't make it. You all know that. So the question, if you're in my job, what you want to do is provide an environment where your rewards and recognition are fair. And when people, they're not demotivated by them. But typically, it's pretty down the list in terms of compensation. Other things matter a lot. Personal growth and this idea of feeling part of something that matters and being motivated by that organization, those are really critical. Those are the prepared slides. I would certainly like to take questions that you have at this point. Yes? Sam, can I look at that last slide? So to me, this looks like a view that any company might strive towards. So just a question on, do you have metrics associated with a balanced score, or some sort of dashboard associated with how you measure your success in these three routes? And if one of those were biggest, which one would be? Yeah, I think it's a good point. And there always is this question of how generic you are versus how specific. I think a couple things that make it less generic are, we are talking about differentiation and inspection and measurement. We're talking about comprehensive solutions in terms of portfolio. So that matters to me. And the way that gets measured, I measure differentiation by our gross margin. And so my view is the higher you differentiation, the more you get in gross margin, because that's a measure of how your customers value you, the differential they're willing to pay, and also market share. And of course, for us, it's long-term market share. This one's easy. Long-term, it's just shareholder value. And that becomes the metric. But to your point, that's kind of what everybody has. In our business model, our focus is on, we have higher R&D percentage than most every other company in our industry, but our gross margin is higher. So our gross margin is 57, 58 percent, and the nearest rival is probably 51 percent. So we spend more on R&D. So our business model works. If we get high gross margin, we can afford higher R&D to do innovative, creative products. So from my standpoint, keeping that business model in line, the growth metrics, we want to grow faster than the industry, and right now, the forecast for the industry, let's say it's 10 percent, we want to go faster than that. But more important for us over the next few years is growing the bottom line in the faster. So we do have metrics in each one of these. This is where metrics get really high. You know, it's how do you measure employee satisfaction and really productivity? And so there are metrics that exist, and that is you look at turnover, you look at retention, but that's a harder one to have play metrics on. So you do surveys, and you try to figure out how the people feel about the company. And sorry, the second part was that one of those were the biggest circle which one would have been. You shareholder? No. For me, I think it's employees. I mean, I think that if you don't do that, the other parts won't come. And if you focus on, and it's tough because it's the hardest one to measure, but you're employees, in our case, our product earnovers every two years. We have a new product in every product line. So if your teams aren't creative, then you're not going to satisfy your customers. And my view is the shareholder is the resultant of doing the great work on these two. That's what you end up with. But if you focus too much on that being the metric, certainly over a short term, then I think you have some odd behavior that's long term not healthy. Okay. Yeah. Thanks, Tom. I'll tell you a standard problem. A product line? Imagine product. Is it through acquisition? Or in house? All right. Great question. The question is, how do we expand from one to multiple product lines? Combination of both organic growth. So we had some cases where we take teams. At one point in my career, I got to do that, which I was spun out of an existing division and went to a startup. And same kind of deal where, okay, you think you're so smart? Get us a new new market. And the other one is through acquisition. So along with 10 core, we've done others and we build the portfolio in both ways. And my view is you got to do both if you're a company like ours. Because to get the growth rate you need, you've got to look at it. The problem with acquisitions is most of them destroy shareholder value. They don't create it. So you got to be very disciplined and strict. You can't fall in love with the deal. You got to make sure it fits strategically. And you got to be honest about the valuation. And that's part of falling in love with the deal is not paying too much. So we did a combination of both. But the biggest ones were through organic and then the 10 core merger. That was the other big one. Yeah. So with regard to R&D and also employee company says, as you're going to know, how do you see your strategy? Are you doing any more R&D overseas? Are you acquiring more of these? Yeah. So you're going to work with the market size and you're going to be selling these types of things. Oh, a company size can't stay the same. No, a company has to grow. I mean, that's the public company's got to grow in both profitability and revenue. So you answer your first question. R&D, we're doing more internationally globally. We're also doing more alliances and partnerships. So as our components become more critical, our ability to work with suppliers becomes more critical because they become a key part of our technology. For example, Karls Eises and Optics Company in Germany, they make a very complicated lens for our latest inspection tool. The lens is this big half a million dollars and it's the part that enables us to image the devices. So there we've got it. They're doing R&D and we're working closely with them. We have other suppliers throughout Asia. And we have an R&D center now. I mentioned we have some in China that we're doing a little bit but we're doing a fair amount in India along software and algorithms. But my view is this global lives it's over time. And so one of the challenges for any company is how do you manage global R&D? It used to be the rule was everybody is in the same room and people did studies on how many feet apart you wanted people sitting. That just doesn't work anymore. Now you do around the clock but you're navigating several time zones at the same time. Yes? Do you mention that you take those attention to your competitors? What could a company like Pachiro or live materials do right now today? That is the nightmare I have every night by the way. We track our competitors very closely. We do detail analysis. We have red teams which go and effectively become the competitor and they go through and they figure out with the patent portfolio, with the technology, with the starting point, what's their logical next move? We also mock up competitive tools. So we'll have our labs, we will build the competitor technology and we'll analyze what can it do versus what ours does. I think they are kind of doing what we've expected. We've gotten pretty good at predicting what they're going to do. And the answer is if they were to leapfrog us in technology and there are a few of those out there. My view is market changes in our industry at least at technical discontinuities in one of two places. The customers discontinuity, they go to a new technology and people are ready or in the inspection and measurement technical discontinuity, we're suddenly, in our case we went from UV light to deep UV. And that was a place we could have lost a bunch of market share if we hadn't executed. So it's kind of a generic, to answer your question, generic because it goes product by product, but we absolutely are reviewing those on a constant basis. And the products that I worry the most about are the ones where we have a large share and there's no competitive noise out there. But that's what I really worry about because I know somebody is chasing us. Our business model is too attractive to not get chased by people. So we know they're working on it. I wish they'd give up but they don't appear to be willing to do that. Yes. In the book, the inventor said about Clayton Christians and wrote about the difficulty of human innovation. And he talked to us about your thoughts on that and how would you encourage innovation, especially in life, towards law running out of the business? Yeah. I know the book. We had our own crisis around that a few years ago. In terms of the fear that we were going to get taken out by a lower tech solution that we would ignore, right, the basic, classic problem. What we do is we spin out kind of what I mentioned. We have these small units where they're wholly focused on winning in those markets. And the tyranny of the large, I mean the thing you worry about is companies get too big and nobody feels the heat, nobody owns winning a market. So we intentionally split our organization so that you have smaller units that are focused very heavily on innovating. And sometimes, you know, our view is if we're going to cannibalize something, we should be cannibalizing it. Right? In other words, if there's a new technology approach. So we also do KT ventures where we fund, with venture funds, we'll fund innovative startups that might look like they'll bring something to us in the future. And we'll do acquisitions along the line. So we'll do a combination of organic with small focus groups. We'll do M&A and we'll do investment and venture. But it is an ongoing concern. How are you going to get taken out? Barriers' entry, what analysts will tell me is they'll say, why can't people compete with you? Because a lot of people have come and gone. And the answer is Barriers' entry are very high in our business. So on the one hand, the growth rate is probably somewhat capped. But the barriers is very expensive to bring capital equipment to the market. It's probably $50, $60 million to bring a product to market. And then you've got to have worldwide support systems. And there aren't that many customers. So customers tend to favor buying from large, larger players. Yes? Is product your only definition R is something like quality of service also considered to be the potential? I'd say that not just product, application support is one where we figured out a few years ago that our products using them is very difficult. And we actually came here and started hiring post-docs out of Stanford to do characterization of our tools. And that becomes the secret sauce. I would argue that some, we have 300, 500 applications engineers in the company. Many of them very well educated. And I would say that in some cases, if that same team went on another product, competitors product, they might be able to make that competitor's product, beat our product. So absolutely, it is the combination of the tools and also the applications engineering and understanding the problem we're solving, the intimacy that we have with our customers. My view is you've got to learn simultaneously across all these fabs and keep the learning rate high. And that's what differentiates us. Yeah. It's a technology and technology that engineers can elaborate some on the delicate relationship you have with suppliers and how that fits into your child. Yeah, it is another constituency. It is delicate because we are not big enough in terms of the amount we purchase to be huge customers for some of our suppliers. So we have to bring something else to them. And what we bring is for many of them, we work on the hardest problems that they'll ever see. And the reason is because the problems we're trying to solve are so difficult that if they're able to do that, they will benefit because it would be pathfinding for them and we'll fund R&D as a result. And we have strategic relationships with a lot of them. And the result is they'll get ahead and we will benefit from that relationship. But you do have to manage it over the long term. And it takes a fair amount. I spend more time with suppliers now by far than I did say five years ago where most of my time would have been more with customers. Yes. I think it is a challenge for companies like ours to find how do we fit in that system. And I know that if there's one area that I'm getting pressure, for example, from my wife on, it's how do we become more prominent, a better corporate citizen. And there's some obvious things you have to do. But over time, I do think it's a great question and I'd say we have an answer to that one. For so many years, a lot of starts like ours were more focused on these three. Right. Yeah. I suppose that's true. Is there a single largest consumer of KLA products now or are you getting more smaller? Yeah. I wouldn't say smaller. I would say the semiconductor industry is still 20 companies make up 80% of the sales. And the largest ones are the usual suspects. Intel, Samsung, TSMC, you go down the list. And so they're all very strong and they all influence us. But IBM was bigger, relatively back then than anyone is today. And that's probably healthier for the industry. And they push us in different directions. They absolutely push us a little bit different. The Intel world, there are different needs to satisfy people that make microprocessors than people that make memory and people that do foundries that do manufacturing for others. They have other needs. So if you're in a position like ours and you have high market share, you've got to satisfy all of them. The other thing that's happened in the information age is they all share information all the time. And one of the messages is my team is if you screw up and dress, then they will know about it in Singapore. So you've got to be on your game everywhere. And that's another challenge. And also, by the way, creates a barrier to entry for people because they know that they've got to satisfy multiple customers at the same time. The pricey strategy? Absolutely. There have been attempts by customers to share information. And we try to price fairly. But that's obviously an area that people try to get leverage on the suppliers. And our responsibility is to create more value. So it's an ongoing challenge. Yeah. What can you do for the development of your people? A number of things. One is new opportunities in terms of different responsibilities and taking different roles. We have some mentoring programs that go on in terms of inside and hooking people up with more senior level people where they get exposure and opportunity. But we're still start up like in the sense that the best thing we do for our people is give them new opportunities in terms of job rotation, not a formal rotation program, but throwing them into the mix and giving them different opportunities to take on new challenges. And there is a formal succession program that I sit in every quarter. We go through all the high potential, high performance, employees, and think about what kind of development opportunity they need, what kind of experiences haven't they got that would round them out. We'll do targeted 360s with people. In other words, we'll get feedback if somebody is in a development role of how can we help them get to the next level. And so we do a number of things, but this is another area that I think that is ongoing and more work to be done for us, for sure. Yes? The things that one of your main strategies is virtual and acquisition and different company have different value. And what kind of value you handle, the value of the new company? By example, what did you do when you were in the Northfield headquarters? Yeah, that's a great question. Because how do you, can you really check for, is there alignment between the values? Ten core, it was pretty close in terms of the values. The one exception is KLA was more focused on competitors and ten core is more focused on customers. And it was an interesting difference where we had the kind of bear in the woods, the old story. We thought if we could outrun the other guy, that was what mattered. And they were more customer focused. Our view now is when we look at acquisitions, that's one of the tests. Do they share values? We just acquired a company, a public company for about $450 million last just closed on it a couple weeks ago. And that was one of the screens we went through when we were evaluating them. Did we think that we shared values and did we think that that was going to work? The other thing we do is try to, without overtaking the company, just put some management into the company and some KT people that have experience with our company and get some cross-pollination. Likewise, take people from the company we're acquiring and have them get some experience at KLA. But it is a real challenge. Absolutely, I think you hit a good point. And particularly when we acquire startups and we've done that as well, you acquire them because they've been successful and innovative. The last thing you want to do is load them down with a bunch of process and slow them down. So we've had to be thoughtful about how we do that as well. Yes. Yes. Hi Rick, I have a multi-part question. The first part is that since the mid-90s there's an increase of usage of performance and asset software, the semiconductor industry, like advanced process control systems and so on. What, where do you see that going and what percentage of your budget is currently towards that sort of software? And overall, who are like your main competitors and what are you doing to stay at hand with that sort of software that increases yield and performance productive? What is its role? Because it's improving the overall value of these businesses and their different business units and the products. Right. Good questions. Let me start with the idea that there's performance enhancing software, steroids kind of software. It's really about APC is advanced process control. So taking input, feeding back and closing the loop. We're in that business. We bought a startup that did that business and we ran it for a while and we realized that we shouldn't be in that business. And the reason was that it was really our customers business. And so what we ended up doing was getting out of it and our view is we'll enable it. And so what we'll do is provide data to people so that they can do their APC, but we wouldn't try to provide it. Where we did instead is try to provide more software on our tools themselves. Our customers are funny in the sense that they're willing to write big checks for capital equipment, but they don't like writing checks for software. And so our view is instead of fighting that battle, embed the software into the hardware and even customers would tell us, just put it on the hardware we can pay for it. Otherwise, I got to go through a big justification cycle. So we ended up embedding and distributing more on our products and trying to enable them to do APC as opposed to trying to sell them the complete solution. But we did go down a path of thinking we could sell the whole solution and found out that it was competing with our customers generally not a great strategy, right, to compete with your customers. And so we didn't, in that case, we backed off. But we are absolutely enabling it. And that's our view as we can provide more value if we do that. Thank you. Yes. We just looked at about the local R&D and I think that we got one. Yeah, sure. So today we do R&D in a number of different places, I mentioned that. We have one product line I was talking to somebody, the person managing it. We have an operation in Israel that produces part of the product. Algorithms are done in Russia. Integrations done in the US and software is done in India. For one product line. And the beauty of that, if you're running that product line, you don't have to sleep. You can be up all the time talking to somebody on your team. But the challenge is integrating it. And I think that what we figured out is we have to break it into modules to the degree that we can and have modules complete modules done in specific locations. I would say we haven't cracked this problem yet, but we've gotten better. And the degree with which we can move whole products or whole modules to say some of these developing regions like India is a good example. We took one software product and moved the whole thing to India. That worked well because they had complete responsibility. The distributed R&D is one, what did I say? We haven't cracked. We have some examples where we're doing well, but others were, let's just say we're learning. We continued to evolve and learn that. But it does become imperative for success going forward that the companies like ours get better at that. No question. No question. So far, India software, Rush algorithm, we're looking at Singapore for integration. We're going to move a lot of our, we're expanding in Singapore partly because we can integrate products there. We can do manufacturing, which we can do support for our customers there. And it's a better place to manage India from in some respects than California's. And so you have, it's just closer in geographical terms. So we're doing more than that. But it's really product by product we think about, how do we, each product, what parts do we do where? And that's an ongoing evolving strategy. Five years from now to look different. We'll have more things done elsewhere for sure. Yeah. It almost sounds like you don't even be in California at all. Why are you still, I mean, why not managing India from India instead of putting a thing in the water? Because you're closer, you're still not there. And so like, why not just? Because our most talented, most experienced people are in California. Yeah. And I mean, that's, you're absolutely right. I mean, I have to get on an airplane to see 99% of our customers. I mean, there's nothing left in Silicon Valley in terms of people that build semiconductors. There's headquarters here. But the answer, you're right, but it comes down to, we have these teams, and they're very capable and they're very talented, and you can't just reproduce them. And they don't seem to all want to move to India. I've asked. And plus you have this incredible infrastructure here, right? And you still, we all know it. I mean, this is still, in spite of all the people saying that Silicon Valley was going to be overtaken by other areas, it continues to be phenomenally innovative. And so we benefit from that. And there's also no one location you could go. Because our industry is so split out, you could say, well, we'll go to India. But there aren't any customers in India either, right? So you'd not customer facing. Well, we'll go to Taiwan, except for that's 20% of the market. It's still not all the market. So there's no one place you could go. So California's pretty good. But it is expensive, and so you want to be careful about what you do here. And you want to make sure that as you're balancing your global resources, you don't forget that it's people that created these products in the first place, and they're here, right? And we keep bringing in new ones, and they keep creating new products for us. So we're here for a belong home. But I can't just do their purchasing headquarters to China right now. Yeah. Do you see a more distribution of your company to other parts of the world, for example, purchasing more? Yeah, sure. There are absolutely globalization in some areas is already happening, and we're doing some of that. And you just have to be thoughtful that you've got people here, and you don't want to fully displace them. And so you have to manage it over the long term. But that's what I was saying is there are certain things that you don't need to be here. But the innovation and creativity and the R&D, we have the formula for success has been the teams that we have today, and they're working on the next generation. Some of these other functions can be off-short, and we're doing that just like basically everyone is, right? And that'll continue to happen over time. Yeah. You've been using UP as you mentioned, UP does not. Yes. Any plan or any aid to the tools actually in UP? Actually. Yeah, absolutely. And if you've got an answer for us, we're looking at a sub 200 tool right now that we need. We also do electron beam inspection. We do a fair amount there. So we work a lot with Stanford on that, by the way. We have a lot of the resources that I was just going through a list of my head or the people running our divisions. We have a fair number from here doing that. And we're looking at all wavelengths. We're looking at all materials, and we continue to evolve in terms of illumination technologies and collection and data processing. Yeah, absolutely. Yes. So you've made all the good choices. What do you think has been the worst list of the KLR Android taking the foreign port? Did you know that would work? Great question. And as I think we talked before, you sometimes learn from your failures maybe more than from your successes. We tried to do the CDCAM product for 10 years where we tried to compete with Hattachi. To displace them in a market that they owned with a technology that in reality wasn't better. So the hard part for that for me is we did win some accounts, but ultimately we decided to get out. And what's really tough on that is really tough on the teams that are doing that because they were doing great work. They just happened to be working on a product that didn't have a chance. And also you let down some customers. And so you have to navigate and manage that customer involvement. But what it taught me is one of my jobs is to help us avoid making those kind of decisions because they take huge tolls on the employees and especially the people that are customer phasing that have to go back and explain why we've changed our mind and they liked our product. So I think rigor along those lines. And we've had a fair number of failures inside of due product developments. I think that's a natural thing that when you go after products, the key is just can you fail quickly. And the problem I had with this one is we failed slowly. And I'd like to fail quickly and get on and keep going after new opportunities. Yes. If there are concerns in this globalization of some international incident or some situation where all of a sudden you may have no access to let's say you're team in Russia or something. And will that bring the company down or will you have some kind of backup or redundancy to a power for that? Yes, we have pretty good size division in Israel and the north of Israel and near Haifa. And so we went through that just a couple of months ago and it is a concern but then the cost of having redundancy in the system becomes really high. And so instead what you do is you try to navigate, try to manage it, try to have backup plans. But you never have an instant backup plan because you can't afford that. In that case they assured me that they were 97% of the people were showing up. It's amazing the resiliency. In that case they brought in teachers and did day care at work so that the employees could bring their kids in. But their big message to us is we're still working, we're still going. And so I think that would be a recent example. Obviously the tsunami in India was one we were affected, we're in Chennai. So there are things that happen and there are things that you're concerned about. But you have to be careful about putting in redundancy because it's very expensive. And who could predict we could have a big earthquake right here and we don't have backup for that. So there are things you can do along risk management but there are limits to it. We do have the normal plans of backing up information but we don't have redundant teams. One more question. Yes. How do you see the future of India and China? The future of India and China? It's just up and to the right. You know it's just stunning. I mean every time I go there I'm just amazed at the progress in both countries. So for us what's driving our industry growth now is the fact that the consumer market is the biggest driver for us and the biggest driver of the consumer market is the emerging economies of India and China. And so for us I think that it becomes very critical that we understand those markets and how to compete long-term. And I think that there's a lot of great potential in both of those. And beyond that I think it will help the economies and help a lot of the people in those parts of the world which is those are all great things. Thank you all. Thanks, Walter. Thank you.
