 You are listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. So it is a very special pleasure to introduce Steve Bomber today. As you all know, he is the CEO of Microsoft. The interesting thing is, as many of you probably know, he started out at Harvard University. And down the hall from him in his dorm, who should be there but Bill Gates? So I'd like all of you to look around and look at all your fellow classmates. And imagine which of these folks you're going to be starting the next big thing with. Because what happened is after Steve Grudge, when he went off to Parkter and Gamble, and then two years later came back to Stanford. I don't know if you all know that, but he came to Stanford to the business school. And after the first year, during the time he would go do a summer internship, he was asked by Bill to go up and check out Microsoft up north in Washington. So he checked it out and decided the rest was history. So I want to introduce this fabulous wonderful leader who is going to share some of his insights of at the last, I guess, 29 years of Microsoft. But out for their due, Steve Bomber. Thanks. It's a fun to have a chance to be here. I've been in this theater now exactly three times in my life. Today, I gave some speech about five years ago in here and I got a question from a student who suggested that we go borrow a bunch of money. When we had a bunch of money, I had to really think hard about that for like three years. But the first time I was in here was sort of a major moment. I was at Stanford and the play pipping, my favorite play was performed on this stage. And I remember thinking just how awesome this place was and it's sort of fun for me to have a chance to speak here. Although it's not at all what I expected. I'm here in the Bay Area for one reason and one reason only. I was meeting with a few interns. Nikhil was one of them last summer. He's in the class. And he says to me, come on man, we've come speak to our class. And I said, all right, sure, I'll come speak to the class. And I said, what's it all about? I said, yeah, it'll be like 50 people, something like that. Well, I'll just kind of chit chat. And then I pick up the paper on the way down here that sort of reminds me of what we're doing. I said, what's with this thousand person thing? I thought it was kind of 50 people at an entrepreneurship class. But it is nonetheless a delight to be here. We're not going to get Nikhil back for the summer, but we're working hard. Nikhil Ali, Steve B, by the way, at Microsoft.com for other bright talented people looking for work. We're always hiring, even while the economy's tough, there's always a place in some part of Microsoft for the most talented folks around. So I'm glad to have a chance to be here. I'll try to talk for 25 minutes or less. And then I guess we have a chance to do some questions and answers, at least from, I don't know if the students in the class are, or how they'll tell, but nonetheless, I guess we get to do that. I'm going to start with just a little bit about the economy, not because it's the curious or sort of warmest subject to start with. But at least if you're thinking about entrepreneurship, it's probably the right place to start. You say, my gosh, I am graduating. I am starting a company. I'm moving forward in the worst economy in whatever, 70 plus years. Is that a good thing or not? Well, first let's start with the basics. It is really a bad economy. Business is tough. People really are being laid off. We had a round we did yesterday. It really is a tough, tough, tough environment. There's no question about it. And I like to characterize, at least for folks at Microsoft, that I don't actually think what we're doing. We didn't go down and we're going back up. The economy is kind of resetting over a year, two years, three years at a lower level. And then we will build from a lower base. And that happened because essentially the world borrowed too much money. So the question I got here five years ago, should you go borrow a bunch of money? It's a press-yant question. The world had too much debt. Just as a statistic and you'd say, why are we talking about this in entrepreneurship? You've got to understand a little bit kind of the environment in which you work. But consumer plus business debt was about 300 odd percent of GDP before our recent bubble burst. Before the depression, it was 160 percent of GDP. It means we probably at least have one or two GDP's worth of extra money that's being used to fund business investment, to fund startup companies, to buy PCs and flat panel displays and servers and houses and blah, blah, blah, blah. And now you say, all that extra debt is going to get flushed out of the system and it's not going to be replaced. Because after one of these, there's been four of them in the last 200 years of US history. After one of these bubbles, people don't immediately start borrowing again. Everybody's a little more cautious than they were before. So it's a tough economy and you say, well, geez, I want to do a startup. They're going to be investment out there. Well, geez, I want to sell the customers and they're going to need to buy equipment to do things or geez, I want to appeal to advertisers and there's got to be a consumer demand out there. And there's a lot of kinds of ideas that I'm sure swirling at least in some entrepreneurial heads in this audience. And yet in a sense, you could say there's really not a better time to start a business. If you've got the right idea, you will get some funding. The idea is that work good enough shouldn't have been funded and they won't be funded today. So in a sense, the fact that there's a more critical screen, there's more of a careful thought process. And the fact that customers are pickier with their money today, all of that really is a chance to make people better. One of our folks reminded me Microsoft was started and Apple was started during kind of a recessionary period. General Electric, ironically, was started right after the great de-leveraging of 1873. That was the bubble before the depression. It was just like this one. So in a sense, there is opportunity. And there may be more opportunity in the long run, even if kind of the entrepreneurial opportunities are less frothy than they might have been in the short run. Particularly as a guy whose business is for the last 29 years been software, the number of opportunities to create brilliant, genius, amazing ideas, the number of interesting things that we see people doing. It continues to be stunning. So it's not going to be any shortage of real possibility. And so the question is, will you have the patience and the tenacity and the interest to really start something that's important? I started Microsoft as Tina said almost 30, almost 30 years ago. I thought I'd give you my, somehow I'm not pointing correctly, my quote entrepreneurial story. That's me when I left Stanford. I still part my hair, by the way, on the right, just like I did back then. I did meet Bill Gates at Harvard. And he, our sophomore year in school, we lived down the hall from each other. And his friend from high school, they had started a, I actually a company when they were in high school that did software that processed traffic tapes. I don't know if you noticed, but when you drive down the road, you sometimes see these rubber tubes across the road. Well, it turns out in the old days when you drive over one of those, it would punch holes in a paper tape in a box at the side of the road. And you used to have to ship them back to Maryland and Bill and Paul said, geez, let's buy one of these new Intel microprocessors. At the time, it was something called the Intel 4004, just to show you how old days that was. They started a business processing these tapes for cities in the state of Washington. And then Bill came to Harvard and they still loved microprocessors and Paul Allen wanted to build a company to build computers with microprocessors. And somehow, even then, Bill kind of said, no, I know what we're good at, Paul. We're software guys. Let's not do that. And then finally, when our sophomore year in college, the cover of Popular Electronics Magazine, there was a picture of the first microprocessor-based computer, something called the Altair, and Bill and Paul decided to quote write all the software the machine would ever need. Of course, they didn't, but they wrote some important software for the machine. And the company got started and was kind of pernolonged. We were 30 people when I joined. There were no business people. It was all programmers when I joined the company in 1980. I came in to quote be a business person, whatever that meant. Didn't know much. Frankly, all I'd ever really done is interview for jobs and market brownie mix. I wasn't exactly well credentialed. I'd taken the first year at Stanford Business School so I could read a balance sheet. That was pretty important. We didn't have that much money back then, so there wasn't much to read. But anyway, those lessons were important. And then from there we just kept grinding and grinding. A few bits of inspiration, a lot of perspiration. I just spent an hour with a group of venture capitalists and they said, hey, look, if you're going to tell entrepreneurs, I said, look, I'm going to go talk to some entrepreneurs. What would be your lessons from the early days? They were simple. Higher good people. They actually didn't have very good people when I started. Bill was good. There were like four or five very good people. And I went into Bill's office after I'd been there a month or so and I said, we've got a higher 18 more people on top of the 30 that we had. He said, Steve, are people aren't even very good? Why do you want to hire 18 more? And you're going to bankrupt us. Go back to Stanford or something. But don't stay here unless you're going to do better than that. And so we just really worked hard getting good people, smart people. Tina was joking around, looking around at the people you know. Because people you know, at least in my case, they wound up being super important. The initial programmers at Microsoft or people who grew up with Bill, we brought in people we knew from college. Because those are the people you know when you trust. If you start something. But good people, and then a lot of patients. I think a lot of entrepreneurs think that things happen quickly. This is you know, 90% inspiration, 10% perspiration. It's much more balanced than that. It's a great idea with a lot of hard work. And then you work at it for years, two years, three years, four years, five years, six years, seven years, eight, nine, ten. Some things that actually wind up being really important. Take more than 10 years to get popular. You wouldn't believe it reading the popular press. But it's really true. It's really true. It's true of windows. It's true of the SQL databases from guys like Oracle. The Google guys were at it for a number of years. Before that thing really took off. There's a few exceptions. But most things you got really grind on. And certainly that was kind of the history of Microsoft in the early days. We had some products. We were a tiny company. My parents thought I'd lost my mind to drop out of Stanford Business School to go join some company that made software. I said software for personal computers, Mom, Dad. That's why I'm leaving the hallowed halls of Stanford. And my dad said, what the heck is software? And my mother said, why the heck would a person need a computer? Well, we're talking about 1980. And life was a little different in 1980. But it's those kinds of questions. There's a little bit of spark. There's a little bit of a powerful force. And then there's just a lot of hard work to get from here to there. There we go. If you say today, okay, well, is all the good stuff in the days gone by? This is one of the questions I get a lot from people who are just starting out and say, wow, technology's changed so much. Last five years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years. Are all the great companies created? And the answer is no, not even at all. The truth of the matter is if you look at the technology industry, there's always a few big guys, some medium-sized guys, lots of small guys. And the names are always changing because the industry is so darn dynamic. And there's so much new stuff being invented. The way chips work is changing completely as we speak. You're able to get bigger and bigger displays at cheaper and cheaper prices. I didn't check this one out before I walked up here. Look, it's just a piece of plastic. It doesn't know a thing. I can touch it. I'm not controlling it. It doesn't recognize me and say, hey, Steve, stop beating on me. It doesn't see me. Feel me. Speak to me. I don't know. There's something that sounds a little bit like that. But that's the future. That's where things are going. Today, you learn to speak the computer's language. If you want to write programs, you learn to write programs in the computer's language. If you want to control program, file open, copy, paste. Not get me ready for my trip to Stanford. My secretary is able to process that command. My computer cannot process that command. The kinds of things that are going to be invented over the next several years is just to me outstanding. And particularly for somebody who's got skills in software. You don't even have to be interested in the tech field. Software is going to change so many fields. It'll change energy and environmental science. The impacts of software will be broadly felt. So I'm a bit of a zealot on that as a particular expertise. But the chance for entrepreneurship is really, really high. We live in a world where I think things are really also changing based upon the fact that we're still quite early in the presence of the internet. People could say, well, the internet, we've had that for 15 years. It's so much has been invented. And yet, really, the whole world of technology is being redone as we speak. Technology grew up with the computer. And now it's the computer, the PC, and maybe the smart TV. The computers, phones, and TVs didn't grow up assuming the internet. And frankly, the internet didn't grow up assuming smart PCs, phones, and TVs. And so the whole model of how software gets written to run intelligently in PC, phones, and TVs to talk to the internet cloud, that's all going to get redone. Since I've been at Microsoft, the basic paradigm for how software gets written has changed a few times. The main frames, PCs, client server, internet, and now we're in sort of a new web 2, web 3 kind of generation. Smart phones, smart PCs, smart TVs, talking to a smart internet. And that creates a whole generation of opportunity to disrupt the businesses that are out there to create new businesses that people couldn't dream of before. We talk about the cloud. The cloud is kind of that smart internet presence talking to those smart clients. A lot of people sort of question the fact, will we continue to need smart phones, smart PCs, et cetera? And the answer is yes. Yes, people will actually want to get the best they can get. Because this stuff's just so darn cheap. And as long, Bill Gates, when he started Microsoft, said, the hardware represents a form of free intelligence. We just have to have the software to switch it on. And that opportunity still exists. Your world needs to be brought together, the consumer. You have one identity on the phone. You got another on the internet. You got another at work. You got another at home. You may want them separate, but you may not want to manage the cacophony of things that you deal with today. Just take contacts. How many different places do you have to update when somebody switches home, switches phone number? How many different places do you go touch? Just simple things. So much to do. So much to do to improve the overall experience people have with these things. See, I wish there was a camera in that darn screen. Seems to have a distance factor. Anyways. You know, at Microsoft, we're investing aggressively across the spectrum. Match, voice, natural language input, smartphones, smart PCs, smart TVs. We've introduced a whole new platform for writing smart applications in the internet, a new version of Windows that we call Windows Azure. Our company this year will invest over $9 billion in R&D. Nobody, sort of, you can't process what numbers like that mean. I can't. And I deal with them every day. These we've got about 45,000 people involved creating software. And perhaps most importantly, we will invest the same amount of money this next 12 months that we did the last 12. We were going to increase it because of the economy we won't. But it sure reflects the fact that we've got fundamental optimism about what can be created. You know, Microsoft's sort of a funny place. We've got these big businesses. But in the software business, big businesses need to be constantly recreated. Product like Windows in a sense only as good as its last release or two. It's not just its last release, but it's last release or two. And so we need to have this mix of sort of large, yeah. Thank you. Boom. Anyway. Moving right along. I kind of knew what I was doing when I walked down that road. Anyway, you know, you need to have a mix even in a big company of smaller entrepreneurial projects, bigger entrepreneurial projects. It's not like running a factory. It's not like running a bank. It's not like running a retailer. Not just Microsoft, but nobody. In our business, you've got to be inventing new things because software doesn't wear out. It doesn't break or at least if it breaks, it was broken when you finished it. It doesn't break over time, the way physical goods do. And so the opportunity and need to invent just like any other startup or entrepreneurial activity remains strong. So we're investing. Venture capitalists, there's going to be less venture capital this year than last year. They're still probably, in my opinion, more venture capital than there are really good ideas to absorb the venture capital. So whether you're going to join a startup, whether you want to start a business yourself, whether you want to join a company like ours, you know, I think there's just incredible opportunity. We want to be kind of the partner and friend to people who are starting these businesses. We've made our tools now free for students, for startup companies, qualified startup companies. We've made our software free so we can bootstrap entrepreneurs who want to come with us and help pioneer and really pursue the future. The future for students, the student, for consumers, for businesses, for the full range of, range of things. I hinted at this earlier, but I really want to come back to this notion that the range of innovation, you live in almost a better time. You're coming out of school almost a better time than Bill Gates and I did. Because the power of information technology to give new innovation possibilities, not just in technology itself, but in science, in health, in education, is unbelievable. You're able to model today the physical world with computers in a way that was never possible before. People say we have an energy problem, what's the answer? We need better software, whether you believe in oil and gas to simulate or whether you need better tools to model it, model what can happen with new forms of energy. Software accelerates the process, pharmaceutical research, software accelerates the process, education, education is the one industry that never gets more efficient. This is not a slammer Stanford or other fine educational institutions, but in a sense everybody says, hey, the only way to get more efficient is to actually have smaller class sizes. I mean, sorry, bigger class sizes and yet people resist that. So how do we use information technology to actually improve and measure an advanced education? Healthcare, I think everybody understands that healthcare needs to be reborn and reinvented. And information technology is at the key of what doctors and nurses and other health professionals really do. So I think it's just a phenomenal time to be starting all kinds of companies. And I think leveraging and building on the kind of software that our company and our industry provides is just a great, great opportunity. I just want to end on this notion of good times. These are tough economic times, but these are times that I think are rich in opportunity. In a sense I'm going to make kind of a radical statement. When I was a student here at the business school, most people wanted to become consultants or investment bankers. These were the hot jobs. I love consultants and I love investment bankers. But consultants don't invent and most of the products investment bankers invented are somewhat discredited in the current environment. Entrepreneurs who invent, who create, will really add to the level of innovation, the productivity and the economy will change the world, will create economic value, will drive jobs, and I'll have a heck of a lot of fun doing it. And so I think despite everything else, now's the time. Now's the time for people who care, who want to invent, who have skills and specific scientific and information technology areas. I think now's the time. And certainly I hope for many or most of you who choose that path, you'll do it with us, working with us, partnering with us, building on our tools and technologies. But I certainly wish you all the best if you choose to take that path. And as I said, if you're looking for something from us, stevebeatmicrosoft.com, shoot me a little piece of email. Pleasure talking to you and I'll look forward to questions. Okay. Which chair do you want? Do you have a preference? Sure. No. Why don't I go this way? Okay. So this sounds going to work. Since this is a class, the questions are coming from the students. I'm curious. How many students are in the room? Could you raise your hand if you're a student? So look, it's almost all of them. How many of you are from the school of engineering? It's almost all of them. Great. So what about art? MBAs. Any MBAs? A few of you? Snuck in here. In vacuum bankers? One. I only offended one guy, that two ladies and two people. Great. I just curious. How many undergrounds? Wow. That's almost the whole group. What about graduate students? Almost the all group. I don't know. I think I'm double-cad. So I guess it's a big event. There must still be a code term program here. Exactly. Okay. So first question will be over here. Now where are you? Over here. So there will be a microphone that will be moving around to the questioners. I see. This is a question for you. So far I have worked in only big companies. I've worked in HP Intel, IBM, and Oracle. So when you are hiring senior managers for your team, how do you evaluate the big company experience versus the small company experience? I think they are both helpful. And depending on the job and depending what sort of the portfolio of experiences. If we want to take somebody and say, look, you've got to run a very big project. Let's say a big engineering project or a big engineering project. And somebody's experience is only doing small engineering projects. That's a nail-biter. You got to really think about it. Ooh. On the other hand, if you take somebody who has only run large projects and say, hey, look, you've got to lead a smaller team. That too has a real risk portfolio associated with it. We talk about starters and finishers. We talk about pioneers and settlers. Nobody's really all one or all the other thing. But people are shaped by their personalities. They shape by their experiences. And in fact, we benefit from all of these types of people. But in the right job, when we went outside recently to hire the fellow who's running our search business, we got exactly the right person. Somebody had experienced deeply technical, which was super important, and had run large engineering projects. Because that's absolutely critical. On the other hand, Ray Ozzy, who joined us as our chief software architect, which was Bill's old title, he'd only really, he'd spent a little time at IBM. Very short. He'd been an entrepreneur. He'd done startups. But he has a different kind of role in the company. So you want to blend those things, I think, pretty well, promoting from within, hiring from out, big company, little company. A good company, in my opinion, has got to nurture all kinds of people and all kinds of innovation. Because, you know, the world is not, let me say, monoculture. Great. Next question is over here. Hi, I'm Mark Sarasdhary. I have a question regarding, if you briefly explain what your browser strategy is, given Facebook and search as well. Well, the browser, I would say, has a couple different, let me give a couple different aspects. Let me start with the browser itself. I think browsing will continue to be an area in which we'll expect innovation in two ways. The browser platform, that is the ability of browsers to run more exciting, more capable applications, that will continue to climb. I think people do expect, even if you want to go beyond the standards, that things will only proceed in large measure at the speed of standard support, which is a little harder for things to move. There's, you know, there's now what, 43 million websites, something like that. I mean, there's a huge number of websites on the planet. They can't be all upgraded. They can't all take advantage of new browsers. But the browser platform is going to move. We need to innovate in the browser platform. In the browser UI, there's really a lot of innovation still possible. You know, you look at some of the kinds of things we did with accelerators and slices, and our browser competitors are doing their own thing, and, you know, the way you work with history and integrate search, there's still a lot more innovation on the UI. Some of the things that we'll do, now we have a browser that is absolutely regulated. It's a part of Windows, and therefore it's subject to our consent decree. So whatever we do in the browser, we're going to have a clean interface between our browser and our search service, our browser, and our own social networking software, Facebook, etc. But I think we want to design the browser to allow this notion of a social graph to allow this notion of the search database enhancing the browsing experience to be built in. In our own case, we won't wire it in. Some of our competitors might wire it in so that you're bound to their entire solution that can't be our approach. We have a question back up there. Hey, so earlier you talked about that you thought that there was too much money chasing too few good ideas, or at least too few good companies. In your mind, what's the fatal flaw of preventing those companies from being good? Is it ideas? Is it execution? What do you think the big problem with the companies that you see is incorrectly funded? There are many, there's rarely a really bad idea that gets funded. So let me not say that. That's not that wouldn't be right. On the other hand, there's a higher percentage of companies that don't sort of, let me say make it. I don't mean make it always in terms of an IPO, but have a long term life. And too many companies can actually hang on for almost too long with too much money because there has been so much money funding these ideas. At the same time, you will get not just the second or third implementation of a good idea funded. You've been getting the fourth to fifth and the sixth implementation of a good idea funded. My best way of measuring this is what's happening now is the contraction in money. Is there a perfect amount? Let's say there was four times as much venture capital. Would we have four times as much innovation? I don't think so. You'd have four times as many companies, but you might not have four times as much valuable innovation. On the other hand, if we had a quarter as much venture capital, I think that would be in a sense the world would contract too much. I get asked a lot actually by our CIO customers. They say with the contraction in venture capital, does it mean we're not going to get good solutions to the business problems we face? I don't think the contraction is dramatic enough that we're not going to continue to see most really strong ideas will get funded and reasonably well funded. Another question? Steve Walter here. You've convinced me I'm going to go start a company. Now just make sure you build it on Windows. Go ahead. Sure. Now the brilliant folks here at STVP have warned me. Everything you do, especially in the beginning of a company, will shape the culture of the company forever. Now I've seen you twice before, not personally on the internet. One said, go ahead. One's working as well saying developers, developers, developers, developers. One getting really, really, I'm going to throw in a chair now. These are very unique cultural things which are not necessarily bad, but I want to understand, what extent do you feel that you have shaped Microsoft culture? And what are your biggest satisfactions and regrets on how you have shaped this culture? I'd say I feel like I've shaped Microsoft culture a lot. For better and for worse, and Bill and I together, I mean it's not like a couple of parents I would say, you know, we shape each other because we kind of in a sense grew up together and known each other since we were 18, 19 years old. We grew up together, we shaped each other, we shaped the company, the company shaped us, and then things moved on. And you know, you can always say, hey, you know, I wish we were more this, I wish we were more that. And at the end of the day, the ultimate test is whether you're able to get done what you want to get done or what you think the market demands from you. And we've had our successes and we certainly have had our challenges. The thing that in a sense I find in our culture has been the most dynamic tension is between, you know, I talked about patience and tenacity and, you know, sticking two things. That I think is a real virtue, but it can come at the price of demanding short term accountability. So you have a trade off almost. It's almost like a yin and yang. Patience versus short term results. And you actually don't want to, you want to have both of those in proper balance and we're always kind of struggling. It's like you want passion for technology, but you need passion for customers. And you've got to get kind of the yin and yang. You want to be people who really want to be great individually, but you also need good teamwork. And I think sometimes on the, let me call it the teeter totter of each of those three dimensions. We're teetering where I wish we were tottering a little more. As our products are more complicated and we want to have more interdependency because customers are insisting there's even more premium on teamwork as opposed to just individual stardom. You have to balance the culture. I talked already about tenacity versus short term results. Passion for technology and customer you're always dealing with even from the time you're a tiny stardom. I think at least in our own case it's not that I wish things were different, but I know we have to constantly balance and reinforce and build and reinforce the behaviors we need in whatever business at that point in time. And we have another question. Hi Steve, appreciate you sharing about your early days. So what was the reason you dropped out versus completing your degree and then joining Microsoft or whichever the options and what about your initial funding in your case? How do you manage that when it was difficult? Yeah, it was, it was funny. I was, you know, a first-year student happily minding my own business getting ready to try to pick a summer job. I went to school together and I had gone to school and built a build drop out. We had stayed in touch. I actually went up and visited Bill up in Seattle the summer before I started at Stanford. And I was trying to make a final call on a summer job and Bill called and said, hey, look Steve, how you doing? Gosh, things get complicated here. We need a business person. What about you? And I said, well, Bill, you know, I'm in school. And he said, too bad you don't have a twin. I said, yeah, too bad, goodbye. And then I thought about it overnight. I said, well, gee, Bill's the smartest guy I ever met. And I, you know, I can't say everybody I've ever worked with the earlier in Procter Gamble, I was the smartest guy I ever met. I didn't know much about computers and I didn't know much about software really. I'd written a couple programs in college and high school. But I said, I should at least check this out. And I called them up and I said, look, I'm going to go check out these other summer jobs, but then I'll come visit you. And ultimately what I wound up deciding was it was terribly low risk. I could go if things weren't working out by the end of the summer, he'd fire me. And I'd go back to Stanford Business School. That didn't sound too terrible. If things didn't work out long term, they still have a spot for me. I think if I want to go back and finish my MBA, it's just not that high risk when you get right down to it. I didn't have any bills. I didn't have any family. I didn't, you know, what was the risk? And so I said, I'm dropping out and my friends, many of them thought I was nuts. There's a couple of professors who's still over there who told me I was nuts. And I wound up, after a month, I read with them. I told Bill I'm quitting. Going back to Stanford. And Bill said, no, you're not. You don't get it. And our motto is something he actually said to me to get me to stay. He said, Steve, you don't get it. We're going to put a computer on every desk and every home. You didn't drop out of business school to be the bookkeeper of a 30 person company. Got me to stay. And, you know, in a sense, you could say after that point, I never really looked back. It wasn't what I saw for myself. When I went to Stanford, I would have told you I would have been a consultant, an investment banker, or I would have gone to work for a big company. In fact, that was interviewing for summer job with Ford, where my dad had worked. And so I thought of myself more as a big company guy. And 29 years later, I'm a big company guy. Great, great. You've got a question up on the top here. Hi. So there's some other companies that are getting an increasing share of the search traffic market. And Microsoft is doing a good job in investing in smart people to increase the live search product. Nevertheless, being a student, I noticed that Microsoft closed down their book search and academic search product not long ago. I was wondering in spite of these follow-ups, what is life's strategy in general in improving their search and specifically in the academic sector and do startups and their innovation in terms of being partners or acquisition targets play a role of minimal. Yeah. Well, we're not just a number two or three player. The number one player is a lot bigger than us. And they're a lot bigger actually than Yaku. Google is a very big company in search. And therefore, we are more like a startup than we are like a big guy in the search market. We can't invest in everything the market leader can. We're not going to be able to just out do and outspend somebody who's revenue is many times bigger than ours. So our model, and that's why as painful as it was, we said, hey, look, if we're going to do anything with book scanning or academic, we're going to have to do it in a different way than Google's doing it. And that's a path we're choosing. There's some things you got to do to be competitive. And then there's some things I think we have an opportunity to do precisely because we're not the market leader. Because we're not the market leader, we can experiment with new business models like cash back. Because we're not the market leader. We don't have to stay locked into the current user interface for search over time. You know, the user interface drives click through rate on ads, which drives revenue. And so we have the luxury, the flexibility, like a startup does to try more new things. In fact, there is a certain cost of entry, but we're going to have to be more disruptive in the way the user and business model works. And we know we're going to nonetheless have to be patient and show the right blend of patient and patients and insistence on short term results. Yeah, I think there's a lot of big role for startups. We've done some acquisitions. We bought a company here in the area called PowerSet that does natural language technology. Great addition for us. I think the way we partner with content companies and other websites, we have some unique opportunities because we have less revenue, we have less to lose than the market leader does. It's another way to be different in a way that could be good for partners and for consumers. So we have a number of things, you know, and you'll see it released by release as we move forward. Some of the things we're working on. But we're going to have to be more like a startup than more like the big player, despite the fact our search group is part of a big successful company. Over here, another question? Hi Steve. So earlier in your presentation, you're talking about that it was a great time for innovation. All these ideas were happening. I'm sure you've seen a lot of these ideas happen over years at Microsoft. So I was wondering how have you learned to differentiate and characterize these great ideas when they come? Sometimes well. Sometimes not very well. And I actually think that's probably important for anybody who wants to do a startup, anybody who wants to join a place like Microsoft and work on an established or a new product. I'm sort of like a mini venture capitalist in a weird way because I have to sort of be part of the process of picking which ideas our own people have that we should fund, which new products, which new ideas. And I think that in a sense, you've got to have a clear sense of what your core competence and core strategy is. And then you've got to be willing to take, you've got to be willing to do the things you must do. There's some things we absolutely must invest in. Natural language, speech, and voice are going to be fundamental to the changing UI. Good, you know, and we have to invest. Whether we make mistakes or not, we got to keep after it. We have to change the approach if things aren't working, but we have to keep after it. We'll try some new products that are a disaster. The one everybody likes that teased me about from Times Gone Buy was a product we used to have called Microsoft Bob. Microsoft Bob was kind of like a low-end word processor and spreadsheet, but you know, the screen looked like a house and this dog walked around and talked to you about writing your book reports or something. I mean, it wasn't terrible. It was sort of a, let me say a precursor to what people are trying to do now with, you know, sort of 3D virtual world type user interfaces. It flop miserably, but I'm glad we did it. We didn't lose so much money that I say to myself, boy, that was a real mistake. Because a few of those, it only takes a few of those to become something important to really make the company. So a clear sense of your core competence and direction, intelligence and understanding of not only what your own people are doing, but what's going on in academia and in startups, and then the willing to nist to take some risk. That would be what I'd say. Next question. Hi, boss. I'm Samir Salman. I'm interning at Microsoft this summer, and the virtualization group. Stop by. Sure. I'm also working in collaboration with Azur Group this semester on hosting a project, Cloud Application, basically, on Azur. Even though it's still in the battery, our experience has been great with it. My question is, how much attention and resources are you going to give in the future for Windows Azur, and what are your expectations about how will it grow and will it be as successful as Microsoft Windows XP, for example? Yeah. I'm about to have it. Moving right along. I like to joe, I don't know if anybody ever saw this movie called Three Men in a Baby. It was kind of an 80s movie, but the world is now going to be three screens in a cloud. Phone, PC, TV, cloud. Three screens in a cloud. So when you ask what's the future of, let me call it, computing of the future, because our basic business is providing computing platforms. That's where we grew up. That's our roots. When the lady says, you got to know what you care about. That's what we care about. So phone, PC, TV, cloud. And Windows Azure is at the backbone of the cloud strategy. So it's super important to us. It also represents a good part of the future of our Windows Server Business and our SQL Server Business, which are billions of dollars in aggregate revenue for us. So it's both sort of the future of existing businesses, and it's an opportunity to go create new businesses. So it's very, very important. You don't get the name Windows around Microsoft if you're not important to us. It's an important part of our strategy. It's an important part of our future. And actually, I think I hope it's an important part of the future of many people here who write software, either as Microsoft employees or as our partners going forward. Got a question over here. Hi, Steve. My name's Ed. My question is sort of about risk, but also about experiences. So you talked about before, sort of big companies, small companies. What if someone takes the big risks? They take the big risks. They do a start up. It doesn't turn out very well, but it wasn't because they weren't smart about things. They did their best. How does that power up compared to going to safe route? Have you got any tips on like obviously you took some risks yourself? What would you use to say about that? Yeah, you know, you're talking about like in a career planning type sense. What are you saying? So saying, if I take the risk I go for a start up and I turn down some really good job offers, I've got the moment. Later on, is that going to come and bought me if the start up doesn't go well? Or will the experience from the start up still help me get there in the long run even though it wasn't successful? Good, I mean, valuable experience is valuable experience. There's nothing actually I would say start up experiences neither more valuable, nor less valuable than big company. I mean, people want to say, well, start up experiences more valuable or big company. Hey, if you dug into something, I don't care if it was a small company or large company. The key at least to me isn't where you were. It's did you dig in? Did you work your your butt off? Did you perspire? Did you force your brain to really think and have peripheral vision? When I asked somebody like to tell me about what they did, I don't care where they did it. I want to know, did their brain fan out or were they just looking at a little piece or were they really thinking broadly? Did they think comprehensively? Could they be concrete about what they did and what they accomplished? If things didn't work, can they be honest and direct? Big company or small company? This didn't work. That didn't work. So that would be the kind of thing that is important to me. And I hope to the folks who work for us who are evaluating and looking at people. Certainly, I think in most people's lives, it's usually interesting to have some experience in bigger environments and smaller environments. You learn differently from both of them. As I said earlier, I got my big and little all in the same place, which is unusual. But at the end of the day, what I tell you most is to just dig in and love what you're doing. And I think if you love what you're doing and your work really hard at it and you really embrace it, heart, body and soul, I'm not sure it matters too much. I think the biggest mistake most people make when they pick their first job is they don't worry enough about whether they'll love the work. And they worry more about whether it's good experience. There is a time in your life, generally, when you're getting... You might pick a school because it's good for you. And you might pick a second school because it's good for you. But by the time you're picking jobs, I really think you've got to pick a job because you really think you're going to love doing the work that you're doing. And it's a mistake not to. We have a question in the balcony. Hi Steve. This is Karan. One of the few MBA students in the room. So two quick questions. First on the bit for Yahoo. What was the rational behind it? And where do you see it going forward, especially with Oracle acquiring Sun recently? So there's some consolidation which is happening in the industry. And second. The second question is more to do with your R&D budget and you're saying $9 billion. But what's the vision? So budgets are fine. But Microsoft has not been doing a lot of innovation, breakthrough innovation in the past. So where do you see Microsoft taking the lead over the next two or three years? Thank you. Let me first as to Yahoo. It's a long and sort of saga. But at the end of the, which you know, was not, I'm glad we went down the road. At the end of the day, I think it would have been valuable to get together, but it didn't work. I still think that the there exist opportunities to in a sense almost create a better search product by having more customers and more advertisers to generate more relevant advertising as part of the search offering. That may or may not at some point happen. There may or may not be appropriate discussions. I don't, I don't choose to comment on that today. Your second question. You know, at the end of the day, I first disagree with you. I think we've done a lot of innovative things over the last several years and yet so have others. And I think it's sort of one of the important things to remember. Last five years brought us Xbox live. It's the most interesting interactive entertainment thing to come around in the last five years. I say other guys have also done very innovative stuff, but we've done good innovation. We've done good innovation in the business space. We have a product called SharePoint, which probably not a soul in the room knows about, but for our business, thank you, four souls in the middle, probably work in IT. You know, I'm teasing you in the university. It's gone from nothing to over a billion dollars in five years because it solves fundamental problems and the way information gets managed inside corporations. It's not a consumer sexy product, but there are many cases like that. You take a look at what we did with the user interface of Microsoft Office in the last release. And it's different, but the discoverability, the change in UI and what that means not only to what we do, but the way people are now following that is quite big. Will I give credit to, you know, did Apple do a nice job, for example, with the iPhone? Of course, they did a nice job with the iPhone. So you give credit. Is Facebook an interesting concept? It's a very interesting concept, and we are a partner, we've invested money. And there are many other things that people can also get excited about. We've done our fair share, but of course, I'd love to do more. I would have loved to do a higher percent. We've got people working away again on other future oriented things. So I understand we have time for one more question, and I'm going to take the liberty since I'm sitting here to ask it. Okay. That's true. And flashback 29 years ago. And put yourself in the seat here and pretend you were still in school. What do you wish you had learned when you were in school that would have been really helpful to you during your tenure at Microsoft? Okay. There were some things I did learn that were fantastic. Okay. And there were some things I didn't learn. I wish I had taken more computer science classes. Yes. I mean, I wish I had. Or if I was going to go in another field, I wish I had taken more environmental science classes. Or, you know, at the end of the day, I wound up starting in math and physics at Harvard, finishing in applied math and economics and doing business. But real useful things that let me have a deep appreciation for the science, I wish I had done more. Second thing I would say that was valuable. Thank goodness I did one year at Stanford Business School and learned how to read a balance sheet. And understand the basics of cost accounting, which is not mathematical rocket science. It can be, but it doesn't have to be. But I'll tell you, there are some basic, there's a basic language of business that is super useful to be able to speak. And a little bit of book study really goes a long way. Last thing I'll tell you probably the two most important classes I did take. And both by luck. When I was at the Business School here, I took a course which you can take first or second year in business strategy or something like that, business policy. And there's like a few nuggets that just ring in my head. We studied some case about Kodak and Polaroid. And it talked about what the market leader should do versus the week number two player in terms of how you vary cost and investment expenses and business models. And it took a quote from the darn case all the time to our people in high share businesses and our people in low share businesses. But absolutely the most important class I ever took, which was a random that I signed up for it, was when I was an undergraduate I took a course on managing arts organizations. And it talked about how managing the symphony, the newspaper, the ballet. And managing corporations was the theory because reporters don't always focus in on the profitability of the newspaper and ballerinas don't always care about the profitability. And there's some assumption that business people and people who work in business always do. What I found is in any tech business, engineers and scientists are awfully darn important. And engineers and scientists probably think more like often times like ballerinas and innovators than they know it's the science, the innovation in and of itself independent of the business goals are far more important. So some of those soft kind of think about the way to manage and work with people stuff. I locked into it, but I certainly encourage everybody to get a little bit of a flavor of the people side, the language of business and the science. I think that's the, what we call the triple crowned of preparation. Did we pay you to do an advertisement for the Stanford Technology Ventures program? In fact, on that, no, I actually want to highlight that Tom and Kathy, Tom Biers and Kathy Eisenhardt, who are the other two leaders of the Stanford Technology Ventures program. I want to invite all of you to come to all of our other classes and the on-fraud-thought-of-the-electro series, which is open to everyone. And I now want to invite up the two students, Nikhil Anali, who have a presentation from the students of Bases. So on behalf of Bases, SCVP and the ASSU speakers, BIO, we'd like to thank Steve for coming today and just one more round of applause for an awesome talk. Thanks so much. Thanks so much. Thanks everybody. You have been listening to the entrepreneurial thought-leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find additional podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu.
