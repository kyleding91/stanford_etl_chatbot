 You were listening to the DFJ entrepreneurial thought leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. So we are incredibly proud to welcome Julie Zhu here today to Stanford as the Vice President of Product Design for Facebook. She's been there since 2006, leading and overseeing the design of all of their core features, and really doing a remarkable job to support their effort to just think about it, bring a service to over a billion people around the world. She's also an avid writer and blogger. You can find her on medium at the year of the Looking Glasses or blog. She's also written pieces for the Huffington Post, The New York Times, Fast Company. And also we're incredibly excited because of course she's a Stanford alum. She got her bachelor's here as well as her master's in computer science where she focused on human computer interaction. And personally for us at STVP, we're incredibly thrilled to have her back. She's also an alum of our Mayfield Fellows program. So please help me welcome Julie Zhu. Hi everyone. So I know this is probably a huge cliche since probably every single speaker says this, but it's a huge honor to be here. I was sitting in your seats about 10 years ago, which seems like not that long and yet quite a long time. We just celebrated our, my class, class of06, just celebrated our tenure reunion here like a couple months ago, which was a lot of fun. So it's really, really great to be here. I remember when I was sitting in your seats and I had just come from Texas. That's where I was raised. And I'd done some web design in the past, but I didn't really know anything about Silicon Valley and know anything about this kind of tech hub and what it means to have a career here and startups and all of that prior to coming to Stanford. And I remember sitting in the audience and listening to the stories of people who had kind of come before me. And in particular, Marissa Meyer and Jen Fett's Patrick and they'd stand up here and they would talk about their adventures after leaving Stanford and all of the great things that they got to go and build and work on. And I was just like, wow, this is super, super exciting. And now I'm excited to be here talking to all of you guys and hopefully sharing a couple fun stories along the way. So as you guys heard, I was here. I did my computer science degree, my bachelor's and my master's. And I was also lucky enough to be a part of the Mayfield Fellows program. So how many guys know about the Mayfield Fellows program? Yes. So for those of you who don't know, this is an awesome program that is really about diving into entrepreneurship. And so one part of the program is that between your junior, your senior year, you go and get an internship with a startup somewhere in the valley. And along the way, as we're interning at our respective companies, we're learning about entrepreneurship, we're taking classes, we're doing case studies, and it's fabulous. It's awesome. It's taught by Tina at a lot of fun doing it. So at the time, the startup that I chose was actually Facebook. And this is a little cheating because in 2006, Facebook was already about 100 people. So it was a startup, but on the larger end of a startup. And it was something I was really excited to work on because it was a product that I and all of my classmates at the time used very religiously. So I went there and I remember my first day at Facebook. In fact, I was signed up to be an engineer and work on some of their photos features. And I had a mentor and her name was Ruchi. And on the first day, she said, OK, there's been a change of plans. I'm switching jobs. I'm not going to be an engineer anymore. I'm going to be a PM. I don't really know what that means for you. But let me introduce you to this pod of people over here. This is our design team. Why don't you sit with them? And chat with them. I've got to go run. And so she left me in this pod with this group of designers. And before that, I'm not a designer by trade. I didn't really know anything about design. But I got to talking to these people. And I sat at that pod and low and behold, fast forward 10 years. And now my career is in design. And when I look back on it, it sort of seems really quite random how it happened. But for me, what was so exciting about design was the chance to work at the forefront. And thinking about what are the people who are going through the experience that we're building? What are they feeling? What are they thinking? How are they able to understand the products that we built? And so to me, that was what was super, super fascinating about design. And also, wasn't that crazy because at the time, the designers that we hired were also our front end engineering team. So it was a little bit of both designing and a little bit of coding. This is back in the world where we were still operating with just websites. So you just had to do some CSS and JavaScript and front end PHP. And it wasn't nearly as complicated of an ecosystem as it is today. But we got to building. And one of the first things I worked on was photos and photo products. I also remember one of my first big launches a couple months later, which was newsfeed back in September of 2006. Over the years, I've worked on things like the Facebook platform and ushering in a bunch of applications built on top of Facebook, including a lot of games back in the era of 2008 and 2009. I worked on profile and timeline and I worked on newsfeed. And today, the team that I lead, we work on design for all of the core features of the Facebook application. So when you go on Facebook and you want to catch up with your friends, you want to share, you want to watch videos or join a group. Those are a lot of the things that my team works on. So all that said, that's a little bit of an intro into how I got here. The thing that I think has been the most fascinating for me as I've looked back on all the things that I've worked on is the moment when you're starting a project. And you're thinking about, here's this awesome new idea that I have. And I can imagine how it's going to work and how people are going to use it. And I want to build it right now. And you rally a bunch of other people together with you and you guys are all excited about this idea. That's how everything happens, right? That's how any idea ever sees the light of day. But the question that I found super fascinating is, how do we know at that point in time whether this is an idea that's going to be successful? How do we know after it's all said done and we've worked our nights and weekends and we've gotten it out to the world, will it actually be something that people find valuable and that they'll find easy to use and that they'll find well-crafted? And being at Facebook, we've had our share of features, some of them that have gone on to be great success and some of them that haven't. And a lot of times at the beginning, there's really no way to tell. It feels like you're kind of rolling the dice a little bit. And this is a thing that I wanted to really study and reflect on over all of the different products that we built is what were the patterns for the things that were successful? Are there ways that we can tell as we are building whether this is something that's going to work or not? And what came out of that and a lot of discussions and a lot of post-mortems and a lot of just looking at the things that we built was a framework of just three simple questions at Facebook that we now use to ask ourselves whether the things that we're building feel like that they're on track. And there are three very simple questions because it wasn't going to be a manual that everybody was going to memorize and understand. But there's three questions that we wanted everyone at Facebook, matter what their role was or what they worked on, whether there were engineers or designers or product managers, to keep in mind when they're having a team meeting or whether we're reviewing the product or whether they're actually just talking with a colleague about an idea to just think of these three questions and to ask them and to make sure that we have really, really good answers to these three questions. So that's what I'm going to talk with you guys about today. So the first question is the most basic. And the question is what people problem are we trying to solve? And the key word here is really the word people because of course whenever we build anything we're trying to solve the problem. But what tends to happen is you start to think in the mentality of your team or your company. And you start to say things like the problem we need to solve is that we need to optimize the click-through rate of our page. And you'll hear things like this all the time. If we're going to keep well down in small ways and in large ways. And that's not a people problem. A people problem as we define it is if you go out and you talk to someone on the street and they were to articulate a problem that they were having, that's how they would say it. That is the people problem statement. So there's a couple things that we look at to make sure that this is a valid people problem statement. The first is that it needs to be human and straightforward. So we're not using words like CTR. We're not using words like optimize or integrate. These are not words that people on the street would use. These are not words that people who are outside of the tech community are going to use to talk about their problems. The second thing is we want to make sure that it's solutions agnostic. A lot of times we start problems by saying, I am going to build an app that blank. Or I'm going to design a website that blank. And already in that statement is an inkling of what the solution is. But what if apps not the right way, or what if it's not supposed to be a website? So a good people problem statement gets away from trying to already constrain it into a particular solution. The third thing is that it shouldn't be about Facebook or your company or your team or whatever winning. And I think classic example is if you say, our service is going to be the best at blah, blah, blah. A person on the street doesn't care of your service is the one that is the best at that. They just want to know, hey, for this problem that I have, what is the best solution? So stating any problem as like, we, our team, our company, whatever wants to win is not getting close to the things that people actually want. The fourth thing is that it gets at the Y. So sometimes you might have a problem like people aren't discovering this page. And that is a problem that we need to solve. But it doesn't go one layer deeper. It doesn't get at, well, why, what's actually the root cause of why people aren't discovering this page? Is it to hidden for them? Is it to confusing for them to find? It's got to get to not just what is happening, but what is the reason why it's happening? And finally, a good people problem statement can not just solve functional problems like a confusing flow, but could also get at emotional or social problems. Sometimes people just want to feel like they belong. Sometimes people just want to feel like they're validated. Those are things that also constitute something that when you ask people, they might say. So let's look at some examples. So earlier this year, I had the privilege of attending the Moms 2.0 Summit. And this is a gathering of a lot of influential bloggers and journalists who are mothers and who talk about parenthood and those topics. And so I got a chance to meet a lot of the attendees and be on a panel with some of them. And one of the things that I heard over and over again was basically this. And this is an example to me of a people problem statement. I want to talk about an interest with other people who are also interested, but I don't know where to find them. And this is especially relevant at this conference because a lot of times what would happen is you're a new mom. And you're in your friend group. Nobody else is having babies around the same time as you. But at the same time, there are so many things that goes through your mind. Do you want to know, is this normal? My baby just did this. Should I be worried? What are some resources? You want to have a community of other new moms to be able to talk to. And so a lot of times, women will not know exactly where to find that community. And if they're lucky, friends or other people would say, hey, there's a local group here or there's a neighborhood moms group. But this is something that a lot of people in the audience were talking about as something that was a problem to them. So this is an example of a people problem statement. Here's another example. This one we've heard over and over again ever since we introduced the like button on Facebook. Everybody would ask, why don't you guys have a dislike button? And that would be one of the top most requests that we've had for years and years. But that's not really a people problem statement. That's just a suggestion. If we dig deeper, the reason why people wanted a dislike button is, frankly, because not everything in newsfeed is likable. People write about hard times that they're going through tragedies that are happening in their lives. Recently, we just went through this election, which was very, very charged. And people would read things or say things that made them feel a lot of different emotions, not just happy ones. And so that is basically the people problem statement. Not everything in feed is likable. And I want to be able to easily express other things. And finally, one more example. So sometimes I call these people problem statements. Sometimes are not just problems in the way of like, hey, someone going to bring this up as a hardship in their life that they want to solve. Sometimes it's just more of an opportunity or a thing that if you ask people if they wanted, they would say yes. An example here is the desire to share spontaneously and authentically. A lot of times we're going through a pretty cool experience. And we might capture it at that moment, and then an hour later go and upload it on Facebook. But how cool would it be to actually have that experience live with our friends and our family? So that is an example of another people problem statement. So those are basically the first thing that we always ask. OK, do we have a statement that is really about what problem we're trying to solve for people? That's the first question. So now the second question is, well, how do we know this is a real problem? And by no, I mean, well, what evidence do we have? Is there qualitative evidence that it is? Is there quantitative evidence that we can look at? And I highlight the word real, not because I think that there are like fake problems. But just because I think the question to ask is, is this a problem that is worth solving? All of us have limited time, energy, resources, money, whatever, to be able to devote our being to trying to solve problems. What makes this one the one that we should pick out of the thousands or millions of problems that are out there? And so this question is really about just making sure that the opportunity is something that is worth tackling and that we aren't just solving problems for ourselves individually, but that we actually are very aware of the problems that the audience that we're building for is facing. So for the example of groups, I want to talk about, I want to find other people who are interested in discussing the same things as I am. The way that we tried to validate whether or not this was a big enough use case was, of course, we went. And we talked to a lot of people, but we also looked at some of the data that we had. So when we designed the group's product to start with, we imagined that most of the time you would get invited to the group. So I might start a book club and I'm going to invite some of my friends who, like reading the same book, says me, and that's how we're all going to know about the group. So in our initial formulation of groups, it was really all about being invited by somebody else who was already a part of this group. But one of the things, actually, that some of the engineers on the group's team had hacked over the years was this little unit called groups you should join. And so some of you guys might have seen it. Sometimes you are scrolling through your feed. And this little story will pop up. And based on what your friends have joined and groups in your community and groups that are similar to things that we think you might be interested in, you'll see some recommendations. And you can go and explore them and decide to join them if you want. And we thought that this was just a small feature, but really most of the inviting was going to happen through the normal invite process. But when we took a look at the data, what we found was that actually a third of group memberships were starting to happen via this little groups you should join unit, which meant that there actually was a need and a desire already using the tools that we currently had that people wanted to find things that they weren't explicitly being invited to. That there were examples of all sorts of things that they wanted to be able to participate and see that they just weren't getting connected to any other way. So this was, I think, good evidence for us that if we wanted to devote something, a larger solution to helping people discover groups that was a worthwhile endeavor. We also talked to a lot of people in a lot of different groups. One of the folks who talked to reference this group called the Physician Moms group. This is actually one of the most active groups on Facebook. And I think something like one out of four doctors who are mothers in America are a part of this group. And one of my friends actually happens to be a doctor who just had a baby. And so she was lucky enough to have one of her colleagues add her to this group. But she talked about how meaningful it was to her. And she would spend hours on this group every single week. Because these doctor moms would be sharing tips on how to balance their work and how to really tackle a lot of the issues that come from being that profession. And this is an example of a group that everyone who's a part of it finds a hugely meaningful, but not everyone knows about it. Because how would you know that this thing even existed out in the world unless somebody told you? Another example is I recently attended our 10 year reunion. And at the reunion, I think a lot of people are using groups to coordinate events and meetups. And the biggest barrier is that half of the people that I talked to didn't know that these groups existed, that there was a class of 2006 group, and that there was a reunion group, and that there were groups for different dorms and who are planning their get-togethers. And finally, there are a lot of groups. I'm a designer, and one of the top groups that a lot of designers in the community join is this group called Designers Guild. And a lot of designers share tools and articles that they've read and other resources. And every time I happened to add someone, because I thought about them, that they might enjoy it, they're always like, wow, I didn't know about this. That's the first thing that everyone always says. I didn't know about this. So all of this, when we did our focus groups and our research, I was more evidence that in fact, we should be doing more to help people discover groups. So we ended up doing was actually building a pretty simple discover feature. If you go to your groups tab right next to it, there'll be a tab called Discover. And we did our research on what were the topics that people were most interested in. So you can scroll through. You'll see suggestions based on things that you already are part of. But then you'll also be able to go and browse by category. And this is where you can find parenting groups. If you're a photographer, people to go on photo trips with on the weekends or play sports with or joining a writing group. And these are all groups that are public and that actually want to welcome new members. For the people problem of not everything that I see in new speed is likable. And I want to be able to express other emotions. We wanted to make sure that this was actually a problem that many people faced and that the solution that we had would actually directly address it. So we looked at, we talked to a lot of users. We had them go through their feeds and describe to us for each story what was your reaction, what were they feeling? Just sort of like a free flow. Tell us what's going through their minds as they're going through their feeds. And a lot of time people would say, well, there should be more ways for me to just say something. Because what I like about the like button is that it's so simple. I don't have to go and comment and the keyboard comes up and I have to like, you know, to handily type something. I like the fact that I can just in one gesture kind of scroll through things and then say that I like it. But the only thing that I can do is like. And there's got to be other ways for me to express other emotions. We also looked at, you know, how are people using how are people expressing that they don't like something today? And we looked at the stickers that people were using and leaving us comments as well as the emoji. And what were kind of the most popular ones were, you know, how frequently were people just leaving a simple sticker or a simple emoji? And finally, we looked at also short comments. So we looked at how many comments were just one or two words. And all they expressed was like awesome or like that sucks. Or, you know, a very, very short phrase that we felt we couldn't encapsulate. So with all of that, you know, we decided, we looked at all that data. We looked at what were the most common emotions that people wanted to express. And we designed something that we felt was sort of fulfilled that criteria of being really, really lightweight. So you can still do it with one hand and one gesture. It's not like multiple taps. And we also, you know, taking all of the data that we had gotten from what were the most common things that people, you know, the common reactions that they had, we built the reactions product. And so you just scrub through. And we took the top most what we couldn't want to do to be universal reactions. And that's the options that you see in that tray. And finally, for the people problem of, I want to share spontaneously authentically in the moment. This was interesting to us because, you know, we had the Facebook Live product out for celebrities. And we built it for celebrities and public figures first because when we talked to them, that was something that they told us very directly that they wanted. And it was something that they were used to because, you know, they lived their lives in the spotlight. And they're very used to going on to the red carpet and doing interviews and, you know, being broadcast live. And it was something that they felt they could do to kind of connect with their fans a little bit more. So this is something that we had out that, you know, they, that was only available to public figures. But what the interesting insight for us was, well, is this something that people want? Who are public figures, you know? Is this something that people in the audience, you guys, me, you know, all of us, would this be something that non-public figures would use and find valuable? And that is the question that we set out to try and uncover and prove. And actually, one of the easiest ways for us to do that was to, you know, just build it for ourselves, you know, we already had the code that ran for public figures and we just turned it on and we, you know, see if anybody at the office uses it and what their reactions were. And we saw actually a lot of really creative ways in which people used it. Some people used it to broadcast their team meetings, you know, for people who were, like, working from home a lot of times when our VC programs weren't working super well. The other benefit is that, you know, you record the video and then it's available afterwards. So for people who couldn't tune in live, they still had a chance to watch the contents of the meeting. We also saw people just take it out for a weekend. So, you know, they'd go to brunch on Saturday with their family and then they would go live and then, you know, people would chime in and there would be this conversation and the people who did this were like, yeah, it was awesome. Like I had a great time. And then we also saw people, you know, taking it for, you know, a run. So a team at Facebook was doing this relay race and, you know, they wanted other folks to kind of cheer them on and give them support so they went live and this is also like a super fun thing for them and for all the people who participated. So that was some incline that, you know, hey, this could actually be something that other people wanted. And so what we did was we just, we launched it to a small percentage of our users, you know, as kind of a test to see if there were, there was interest in the market. And that was, you know, the Facebook live product on Android, it launched on Android first. And right away we did see a lot of really, really creative uses. So one woman, you know, who was a tattoo artist was started to broadcast live, you know, as she was in the process of tattooing somebody. We also saw a woman who broadcasted her wedding live because she had family members who couldn't make it and who couldn't travel the long distance. And, you know, it was really, really cool to be able to see how she could engage and interact with those audience members and almost have it feel like, you know, they were a part of that experience. And, you know, I had a lot of fun taking it out. I managed to get reservations to one of the best restaurants in San Francisco, Lazy Bear. And it's a really cool experience because the chef stands up there and he explains every single dish. And he kind of talks about, you know, all of the love and care that went into, you know, how this dish came together. And I just decided to go live and like, a ton of my friends tuned in and everybody's like, I really want to go to this restaurant too. So that was really fun. Okay, so that brings us to the last question. So let's say we built this. We validated that it's something that people want. Or we think, you know, there's enough reason to believe that it's, you know, something that is a real problem and then that's something that is worth solving. So now we build it and we put it out there. But even actually, before the thing is out in the world, in fact, even before maybe we have a full prototype, the question for us to ask is, well, how will we know if we've solved this problem? You know, like, what would be different in the world? What would, you know, if we fast forward and now this thing that we've done is out there? How will we know if we should be happy, if we should be excited, if we think it's, you know, it didn't live up to our expectations. What exactly should our expectations be? And I think this is a really, really important question to ask upfront too often what ends up happening is we have this idea and then we build it and we launch it into the world and then results come in, you know, we're looking at like the dashboards, we're looking at how many people are downloading it and what they're saying and, you know, there's tons of data points that we're trying to, you know, interpret and put together. But it's hard at that point in time to then be very, very objective about, did we solve the problem? Because a lot of, you know, our natural inclination is to, to read into the good things that people are saying and to kind of consider all of that effort to have been worth it, right? And that, that, there's biases that kind of come from when, you know, you're already looking at data and you're trying to interpret whether or not it's good or bad. It's much better before you launch to have figured out, you know, what constitutes success for you. So that you can, you know, go into the launch with that understanding and as results come in, you can map it to your previous, you know, this was my criteria for whether or not we've solved the problem or whether this was successful. And so what we do here is we want to make sure that we set measurable goals and metrics. And measurable is really key. Measureable doesn't always mean like numbers or data, but it does mean, you know, there's a criteria where if I did this thing and I got this result, I know what to make of that result. So for the example of groups, you know, we wanted to help people solve the problem of helping them find, you know, other people to talk about their interests with. We ended up building a group's discover dashboard. What does success look like for us? So before we launch, we determined that, well, if we were successful at actually helping people solve this problem, we would see that more people are then discovering, you know, groups that they're interested in and joining them. But not just joining because, you know, I could make a giant button flash and make it red. And I'm sure more people would click on it and more people would join. Like that doesn't really count, right? What really matters is that they join these groups and these groups are actually meaningful to them, which means that if we, you know, fast forward a couple of months, three months, let's say, and then we look back, these people are still using those groups and they're actively engaging, meaning they're, you know, talking with other people, they're reading the content, they're sharing content, they're liking their commentary. You know, we want to know that people are joining groups that are actually valuable for them and that they're spending time on. So that is actually the more important metric was not just joins, but meaningful joins. For the example of, you know, I want to be able to quickly express my feelings about a story, but not everything is likable. You know, we launched reactions. And prior to launching reactions, we wanted to make sure we measured a couple of things. If we were successful here, then what we should see is that, well, people are using these reactions and not just using them, you know, it's not good enough if like all the people that were previously, you know, using a sticker or an emoji or a short comment then converted to using reactions. Because then it's just sort of a one-four-one trade, right? If reactions was actually more lightweight, we should see more people using that than the previous set of people who were using all of these other tools. So that was really important to us. So I was kind of the first thing that we looked at. The second thing we looked at was, we wanted to make sure that every reaction did get a fair amount of usage across different markets. And this was important to us because, you know, in the beginning, even when we started to design, we had to make sure that we had reactions. We had, you know, considered lots of different options. You know, we'd considered, you know, maybe, maybe it'd be funny if, you know, you were like, you know, like an awesome button or, you know, like, there's a tons of different things that we could have put in order to make it more expressive. And the reason why we distilled it back down to six is because we wanted to make sure that it was simple to use. And if you were going through and choosing from like a grade of 20, suddenly, you know, it doesn't feel that lightweight anymore. Like you're pulling up an interface and you're choosing something and it's going to take more than a couple of taps to get you to what you want. So it's really important that we nailed and got to a really, really small set, but that we picked the right set. So we wanted to make sure that these were universal. And it wasn't like, you know, people in certain countries were using, you know, certain ones more or people in certain demographics were favoring others because it was a more niche thing. We wanted to make sure that these were actually things that expressed, you know, the emotion people wanted to express in all of our different countries and in all demographics. And then finally, we wanted to make sure that the experience was good for the receiver. So if you, you know, posted something and then you got a bunch of reactions, you know, that make you feel bad, that make you feel confused, you know, was it, you know, like, do you not know what was it going on or did you just feel like it was a negative experience that made you want to share less in the future? That was also really important. And that was actually one of the reasons why we never straight up, you know, put a dislike button because dislike in of itself can be very ambiguous. Am I disliking the content that you posted? Am I disliking you as a person? Am I just not agreeing with your point of view? And so, you know, in all of our research and understanding of this like, we knew that it was something that people were going to get confused by and wasn't going to be a great experience. So when we launched reactions, we similarly wanted to make sure that that wasn't the case, that the, you know, emotions that were being expressed felt like they were adding to the poster's understanding of what their friends and audience had to say. And finally, for the example of, I want to spontaneously and authentically share in the moment, what we decided to measure and look at was that, you know, of course, people were broadcasting. But again, it's not just that they broadcast once because that's something that you can, you know, make happen by doing a ton of promotion and by putting it front and center, you know, if you just, you know, if people will try a lot of things once because they don't know what it is or they think it sounds exciting. The true test for us was when they had a live, you know, they went live and they had that experience, did they like it enough to go and do it again? You know, that is the key that tells us we built something that is valuable and that's worthwhile because people will come back and do it again and do it again and, you know, they'll incorporate it and make it a part of their lives. The second thing we looked at is we wanted to make sure that, well, if, you know, maybe, be fine if broadcasters loved it, maybe, you know, everybody wants to go live all the time. But is it really a good product if nobody wants to watch, you know, what people are broadcasting live, right? And then it's sort of one-sided and over time, broadcasters are not going to want to do that because nobody ever watches anything. We wanted to make sure that the content was actually interesting and a way that we could measure that was, is the time spent watching live videos going up proportionally and, you know, when we run surveys and other things, are people saying that this is like a valuable thing that they want to watch. So to recap, one of those kind of the three questions that we always ask in product reviews and, you know, anytime we're talking about products, we want to make sure that we know what people problem we're trying to solve, that it's very clearly defined, that we can picture, you know, the audience or a particular person in mind as we're designing the product and that we're not solving, you know, problems for ourselves or our company or our team, but that we're actually, you know, focused on an audience that, and a problem that matters for them. The second thing is just making sure that we know it's a real problem, you know, through looking at whatever quantitative data we have through doing focus groups and talking to different users, understanding that this is something that is a good use of time for us to work on and to solve. And finally, being very, very rigorous about what does success look like and how will we know if we put something out there and it did what we wanted it to do. And if not, then we go back to the drawing board, we learn what didn't work and we keep iterating. But these three questions have helped keep our teams focused on what matters, which is ultimately the people that we design for. So that's it for this presentation.
