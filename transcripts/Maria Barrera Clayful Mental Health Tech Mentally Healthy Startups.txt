 This is the Entrepreneurial Thought Lear Series brought to you by Stanford Equator. Welcome everybody to this week's Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders seminar. The Stanford seminar for aspiring entrepreneurs, ETL, as you guys know, is presented by STVP, the Stanford Engineering Entrepreneurship Center and basis the Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students. I am Ravi Belani, a lecturer in the Management Science and Engineering Department at Stanford and the Director of Alchemist and Accelerator for Enterprise Startups. Today is an especially special ETL. All ETLs are special, but if you like it's even more special when we have one of our students returning for a full circle moment as a speaker. And I also feel like the campus is weather is usually better when it really wants to extend its arms to a special ETL speaker and it's a particularly nice day today. And for a good reason because we have the pleasure of welcoming Maria Barreira to ETL. Maria is a Stanford Educated Engineer. She got her bachelor's and her master's in Mechanical Engineering here in 2013. And is the founder and CEO of ClayFull. How many people have heard of ClayFull? You can raise your hands. Well, if you haven't, you will very, very soon. So ClayFull is a platform dedicated to providing essential mental health support for the TikTok generation. Today, Maria's company creates accessible resources for K-12 students and has already made a profound impact on thousands of students nationwide. She's raised $7 million of capital and it's the only platform where in 60 seconds you can connect a student to a mentor, especially for their mental health. Before launching ClayFull, Maria played a pivotal role in Nearpods extraordinary growth trajectory, culminating in the company's acquisition for $650 million. And her leadership at Nearpod was instrumental in driving user acquisition, engagement, propelling both B2C and B2C revenues and B2B revenues to new heights and showcasing Maria's adaptness at scaling consumer facing operations. Maria was born and raised in Bogota, Colombia and also then came to the United States at the age of 10 to Fort Lauderdale. And through her Colombian origins, which are also marked by resilience and determination in the face of adversity, her journey underscores her natural aptitude for problem solving and commitment to leveraging technology to create tangible, impactful solutions. She came to the farm as I mentioned and got her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and graduated as a Mayfield fellow. So please welcome back to the farm, Maria. So getting the format for today is we're going to do a fireside chat, but then we're going to really open it up for Q and day. And really, I think the intention here is if Maria can be a catalyst for all the things that you're wrestling with is to really share her wisdom. And Maria's in the throes and the midst of her own entrepreneurial journey. So it's always fun for us to have somebody who's in the midst of the journey itself. Okay, gang? So we're going to do a fireside chat and then I'll open it up in about 25 minutes for Q and day. So start thinking of any questions that you may have and the CAs will get ready for, make it facilitating that as well. So Maria, welcome. Thank you. Sorry to be here. This was surreal. It is a full circle moment. It's always super fun. So I wanted to kick off because you're about 10 years now, a little bit more than 10 years post Stanford. I don't know if it feels like that. Pandemic is sort of a lost time there, but fair enough. And you worked immediately after Stanford. You graduated as a Mayfield fellow, which is sort of this journey that does really push you into the entrepreneurial path in life. But after Stanford, you worked in two growth and marketing stints at two other startups, Nearpod and Chart Hop. What I'm curious about is for all the founders that are wrestling with whether what to do post Stanford, whether to start a company or join another company that's already sort of at a certain scale or join a larger company and build a functional skill set. Can you share your insights to answer that question about when to take the red pill and jump into the founder journey? It is a journey. So my dad always told me learn with other people's money. So that's why I decided to do what I did. I knew I wanted to start a company at some point and going basically my decision point was, okay, I did my undergrad, I did my masters, I can do this right now. There's not a problem that I feel super passionate about yet. So, and I could do it today, but what skills do I need and what are really what am I missing? So instead of going into it right away, I decided I'm going to actually start a career journey that would help me get the skills necessary to do that work. And I was really lucky that in that first job I had out of my master's program, my former boss, he was a CEO at Nearpod, he asked me, what do you want to do in five years? And I said, I want to start my company and he's like, great, we're going to help you get there. Every six months we would have a conversation around what skills do I have, what are the next skills that I need to build? So really it's, I think, yes, finding the scaling organization that can help you get those skills is really important, but more importantly it's that person who's going to help you develop those skills and who really believes in you and will sort of push you through that trajectory. And any tips on that on finding the mentor to the mentor find you, did you proactively, deliberately have a strategy to find a mentor? How can people, if that is so critical, how can people facilitate involving others in their success? It's a little bit of both, I would say right, I've been very lucky through all my hookread to have a lot of different mentors and to find mentors in real people as well as in books and in media and in videos of Steve Jobs I'll watch. So there's a lot of different ways to think of mentors if you will, but I think the main thing is can you find someone who just believes in you and see something in you that you don't even see in yourself? Because sometimes especially when we're early on in our careers, I mean, imposter syndrome is real and we never think we're ready for it to take that big leap, but having someone that does really, I think, makes all the difference. So being here, you get the opportunity to meet with so many people and everyone's willing to get a coffee with a Stanford grad. So really looking at not just like what are the opportunities that are in front of you, but who are the people that are going to be sort of check with you with those opportunities? Not every opportunity is created equal. And can you talk about your specific, you had one very pivotal mentor? Is that right? Yeah, couple, but I would say, I would say, you know, the CEO of Nierpod was really the, okay, and was that something that you proactively sought out or that just sort of happened by circumstance of what you were doing? It's happened by circumstance. So I was doing my masters here. I realized I wanted to be in education after watching a documentary called Waiting for Superman. If you haven't watched it highly recommended, it's all about the public school system and how we can help shift it. And as I was kind of wrestling this idea of, I just got a lot of degrees in mechanical engineering, but I want to go into education. My parents were like, I'm sorry, what? That's okay. We started talking to a lot of people and really it was me going out there and trying to find people to talk to. And then people saying, hey, you should meet with this guy. He's at the Stanford D school. He's doing a fellowship there building a new at-tech company. You should connect. So it's a little bit of like going out there, seeking the opportunities and also the university's lining up for you. Yeah. Showing up when you need it too. Yeah, don't you find that it's like this combination of noticing opportunities and then just being curious and letting things happen. That's terrific. And so it is an interesting transition from being a double degree grad in mechanical engineering to then suddenly going deep into the education mental health space. So can we talk about the vision and origin story of Clayful? Yes. And venture capitalists often talk about how when you start a company, especially when that gets investor back, where you raise $7 million, that there's usually a key insight that a founder has. And usually a moment of inflection, which makes it the right opportunity. I don't know if that held true for you with Clayful, but if it did, can you share? It definitely did. So I was at near, near a proper long time, we sell to schools. It was all around how do you use technology and education, right? How do you use technology in a classroom? And this was right when iPads were coming out, Chromebooks didn't even exist here. So long time ago. And our thesis there was, how do you take these devices that are making a run to the classrooms and make them into instructional tools that teachers can leverage to bring instruction to a new level and learned a lot through that journey, especially how does K12 work? And what is the impact on technology and just like new things coming out for students in particular? Fast forward, I joined Charthop in January 2020. Good times. We didn't know it was coming, obviously, but two months later, pandemic unfolds and we sold into human resources. So as you think about the pandemic unfolding, one of the first departments, if you will, to get affected was HR. Because they're thinking about, oh, how are we taking our people remotely? How are we thinking about employing engagement? How are we thinking about employment to health? So it became very clear that mental health was deeply affected by the pandemic that was unfolding. And while it affected all of us in some way, shape, or form, for students, particularly if you think about elementary and middle school high school students, not having structure, not having socialization, not being able to go to school, not seeing your friends every day, that type of isolation is not just hard, it's cognitively debilitated. And so as I was starting to look into it more and more, I see this article about eight year olds dying of suicide. And that moment was that inflection point where I'm like, okay, well, if back up, if our system is at a point where an eight year old not just knows what suicide is, let alone is caring on with it, something's wrong. And that's where we bring back to mechanical engineering. We think about systems. We think about the whole thing. And looking at our mental health and our education system, if that's where we are, there needs to be something that needs to be done differently for us to not have eight year olds dying. So that was a big inflection point. At that point, text to my sales, like, wouldn't you talk tomorrow? It was 2 a.m. on a Tuesday, a member of the V<|en|> Commission. And at that point, I basically quit my job and just started trying to figure out how do I do something about this? And it, in true a D-school fashion, went into a lot of need finding, talking to everyone I could talk to. And there were a lot of different aha moments through those conversations. One, a conversation with the clinical psychologist that said, no, by the time a kid gets to me, everything that has to be undone just takes so much time. Like anything on the prevention side could have 10xD impact. And like, that really landed with me. So I'm like, okay, cool. We need more prevention. Then you talk, I think about myself, right, coming from Columbia, when I was 10, wonderful family, wonderful parents, love my mom. She's amazing. She was working two jobs. She was busy. She had left her whole family. She had literally left this whole life in Columbia to give me a better life, so I'm making it worth it. And I wasn't going to go and tell her, hey, I need help. Like, my friends are big means to me, right? Or like, I'm going through this. I didn't feel like I could be a burden, right? So I wanted to build something that did not have to rely on the family being the main driver of the student's mental health. And then the third piece was really thinking about the financial aspect of it, right? So if you want to build something that's preventative, it turns out the healthcare system is not there yet, right? Healthcare is very, very reactive. So as we get into the system, I'm like, okay, healthcare doesn't necessarily pay for it. I don't want families to pay for it because I want this to be accessible. I believe in equity. I believe in building something where families without disposable income can benefit. So then who cares? Who else can care? Schools. And it turns out I have a little bit of experience in schools. So it became this kind of interesting moment of founder market fit, where there's this problem that in following months you start seeing students making their way back into schools. And all this information about how COVID has affected their mental health and how that's showing up in schools, right? It's not knowing how to behave. It's throwing chairs around the, across the classroom because they're upset. Kids putting out like literally lighting fires and bathrooms because they don't know how to deal with the regression. So schools are dealing with this big problem. And don't know what to do about it. Okay, well, there's something here, right? All these things are happening. And then unfortunately a couple of months after that, there's a big shooting in your vaulty. And the government decides like we, this is our wake up call that we need to provide more mental health support across the board. And funding becomes more available. So it's all these different pieces and, you know, when I was sitting at 2 a.m. on a 2 single, I think, realizing like this is what I wanted to do. None of those things were in the cards, right? I didn't know any of that was going to happen. So it definitely is one of those like right place, right times, but also like I was so obsessed with the problem that I kept on finding solutions across along the way. That's interesting. So you found yourself constantly gravitating towards solutions to this perpetual problem. And are you the type person who gets obsessed about a lot of ideas or is this sort of a singularity? Because I want, I want to really distill for the students when they know that something is compelling enough to actually quit everything they're doing and go full force and faith against it. I do not get easily obsessed with ideas. No, no, I do not. And it was something that everywhere I looked, there was something that spoke to this. Even, you know, I would scroll through Netflix and they'd be like, Ginny and Georgia or like this other show. It's like, and now I kept on only watching Teen Drama. It's like everything in my life just kept on pointing toward this in a very sort of the universe once you do this way. Okay. And then I see that pattern that's again. So there's just this obsession with your attention. It was relentless. These things that you saw not just a vitamin, but a clear headache, a clear pain point, literally, and then a lack of a solution and a potential model. Okay. So we have then the impulse to then take the red pill and jump in. The next inflection point oftentimes in the startup journey is when you know you're going to be a success. I don't know if you've hit that point yet or not, but because we're two years into the journey now of Clayfell's that right? If you have hit that moment where you now are, know that Clayfell will be a success. Can you distill when that moment occurred and what was the evidence for you? So there's this one of my favorite authors or the other two authors that I'm linking on it. It's Switch and the Power of Moments or their two books, their brothers, and they talk about this idea of bright spots. Like, how do you when you're looking for solutions and seeing what's working, you always look for the bright spots. And then you scale those bright spots. I love that so much. So as we're kind of squrezzling with this very big problem of, you know, 40% of students feel hopeless and sad. How do we make how do we help them feel better? We look at, okay, where are we having an impact and what is actually helping? And one of the big, like points initially where we saw that this could be something is we're testing the status was like our earliest prototype literally built it in a day and a half. And because we're like, okay, this is actually going to work. And we have this conversation with a 14 year old boy from Texas. It's a football player. And he said having a fight with his mom. And he says, I don't know if she loves me because she has to because I'm her son or because she actually likes me as a person. And that happened like five minutes into the conversation. And that moment I was floored, like there is something here, right? Like if we're able to get students to open up and like realize these like really hard deep things and work through them, there's something really compelling here. And so that was one of the first ones. And that's on the student side. And then on the, on the business side, where like the great thing about education is you have to build for an end user, the student, but you have to sell to a very different user, which is the district leaders. And then one of our first sales conversations where kind of getting feedback on our product and he says, I have a million dollars allocated to hire eight counselors. I've hired zero. I can't find them. There's not enough people. So like, what do you have because I'm desperate. And like that moment right there, we're like, oh, there's a staffing problem. Again, very different problem for mental health. But very related, obviously. We're realizing that the different stakeholders have very different needs. And you can solve both needs with one solution. That was in a hot moment. So those who are really early moments, we realize, okay, yes, there's something worth building here. And then over the last two years, we've been scaling that out. And I have so much student feedback that I'll humble back maybe at some point and read some of it for you. If you want to, this is your platform. Yeah, do you want to do it? I do. Well, because I want you guys, my intention is what I want you guys to know is to feel when you've had product market fit. Okay, so that's the intention here. And there's a couple of things just to underscore as Maria's bringing up these quotes from the students is that there was a low fidelity prototype. It was just a day and a half. And with just that low fidelity prototype, you're getting things that are anomalously compelling. And so, so I didn't mean so humble, Bragg Maria. What were you seeing? So after every conversation with the coach, we asked students to give us feedback. I had to just go. What do you think? Somebody read you some of them. Dear coach, thank you so much for helping me out today. You helped me realize my self-worth and that I got this. It's a middle school student. Thank you for being there when nobody else could be. I feel like I'm a little bit lighter. Thank you so much because of this chat, I feel more controlled with my thoughts, my emotions, and able to solve conflicts on my own. And knowing it's okay to be me. Can you imagine if I had this when I was a kid, I would take myself a lot of money therapy. But like these are so compelling. This is one of my favorite ones because we get a lot of questions around why young people want to talk to humans and not to AI. We can definitely dive into that topic because I know it's a hot one. Thank you so much for helping me through my problem. Your kindness and patience really made a difference. I feel better. I feel like I can handle my life more without worry. I will definitely come back because you made me feel better about myself and made my anxiety more manageable. Yeah. There's two more on the read. The thanks for this chat. If I'm going to be real honest, I didn't know what I was going to do tonight and I forgot I had clayful and then I started typing. And I didn't do the bad things I thought I was going to do. So thank you for that and I hope you know that you're amazing and very appreciated. And then my last one, which is actually, it inspired our t-shirt. I wanted to thank you one more time. You helped me deal with a huge issue and I might resolve the whole thing in one conversation. I really appreciate what the clayful team is doing in today's world because the stuff is life changing and life saving. It's a middle school student. Yes. Yes. It's a middle school student. And I want you guys to all understand that we've had, yes. Thank you. So you guys can feel that in your body, I hope, you know, those quotes. And I think that is one thing when you know that you have product market fit you have a need where you need to exist. And your worth isn't about how much dollars you raised from the venture capital funds or what investors think about you. In the most challenging times, you're going to go back to your mission and you're going to go back to those quotes. That's what we'll carry you through. And so with that though, then let's talk about the challenging moments. But what have been the most challenging moments? I know you're only two years in. But what I wanted to do is create space for us to talk about the reality of a startup versus just the myth. Can you share what the biggest struggles? Yeah. Entrepreneurship is very glamorizing these walls for a good reason. And it's not all sparkles and butterflies. It very much feels like a roller coaster. And I joke that it's like if anyone's been in Dr. D. Misfior, it's less of like whoop and more like whoop whoop whoop. You're going up and down constantly. So the highs are highs, the lows are lower because you just feel everything. I mean, everything feels so deep, right? Like this is my baby. This is, it feels so strongly about the work that we're doing. So anything, any challenge just feels really, really hard and really emotional. And I think that that, you know, it takes a toll on you in a lot of ways. I think one of the hardest lessons that we've learned over the last couple years is we're in this very worthy cause, right? We have an incredible mission. We're working and doing some incredible work as you all just saw. And it is really important for us to build a team of people who care not just about the mission, but in building a company that can make the mission come true. And those are not always the same, especially when you think about mental health, right? I joke that being a startup and mental health can be a little bit of an oxymoron, you know, where startup has required a lot of hard work and a lot of tenacity and not a lot of work-life balance. And, you know, we now, as a society, especially post-COVID, we have a very different point of view, like what healthy work life balance means. And it's not working 80 hours at a startup, right? So how do we find the people that are really excited about the mission, that are willing to work really hard for it because it fuels them, because it gives to their mental health, right? And because at the end of the day, when I see this really sad things on the platform that happen, or like the deep feelings that students are feeling, the thing that gives me fuel is that we're doing something about it, right? And that we're working hard to change that. So yeah, building a team, I think, has been one of the most challenging pieces. And can we click into that more? Because you guys, I think you guys are 12 full-time employees and about 140 contractors right now. And I do think that's a really interesting nuanced insight that we haven't heard before of the difficulty of hiring for somebody who's not just aligned with your mission, but can actually execute with what the business needs to build, especially when you're doing something so aspirational. So can we get tactical? Are there any tactical insights or tips that you have discovered that you wish you knew earlier, when it came to hiring that could have accelerated your either safety time or money or accelerated your development? Yeah, I mean initially we were very excited about people who are excited about our mission, right? When you have a baby and they're like, you have a cute baby, everyone's like, great, cool, come take care of it. Come here, hang out with us. So the fact that people were excited about this mission that we were on was really exciting for us. Like, great, let's do this together. And I don't think we were having the hard conversations upfront about what doesn't mean to be able to start up and what does this require if you know? So now in our interview process, we always have that conversation. If not in the very first conversation, definitely throughout the process, right? So what does it mean to work out a startup? Like this isn't your typical nine to five job. This isn't a, you know, but it's probably not what you think it is unless you've been at a 10% company before. So here's what it actually means. Like here's the amount of time you're going to work here. Like here are the challenges that we're working through. And what we've been doing lately is actually having people go through a project that's like a problem solving challenge with our team. So they're not just meeting in an interview and saying like, okay, here's where I work. Here's my experience. But really using that those 30, 45 minutes to get to know our team member, while at the same time working through a project together so they can actually see what the work is like. And is that a 30 to 40 minute project that you were working on? Or do you give them actually a like a two week experience of a project before you make a decision? More of a week and a half. A week and a half. So they'll go meet with two or three people on our team, ask questions around the project and then present it to us in a whole group meeting. So that provides a pretty authentic experience. And two, okay, these are the real challenges that we're working through. And these are the real people you'd be working with. And these are the real questions we would ask. And of course, like you don't have all the contacts, right? So we're not going to judge you on, is this the perfect solution to this problem? But we will judge you on your process and how effectively you use the time with our team members. So you're scoping a 10 day project for people to work on. That's actually a real situation that you're wrestling with. And then they're going in executing and then you're assessing. Any unintuitive heuristics on how to do the assessment that's correlated with good team members that you've discovered or is it really just looking at who's doing, who you think is doing good work? That's a good question. One of my friends jokes that like if you're too intimate to health, like that might be an anti-pattern. Oh, interesting. Right? Because again, it goes back to like what if you're someone who's very, very passionate about mental health, what does that mean about? Why are you joining us? Yeah, exactly. So let's... Okay, so then can I call out the elephant in the room? Wait. He would exist. You know, your mission is to help stabilize people's mental health. I have healthy mental citizens in the world starting at a very young age. And yet it sounds like what you're saying is that startups are intrinsically mentally unhealthy. Is that... Am I assessing that fairly? And if so, can you reconcile for that? Are there... Are there... Do you think doing a startup is a sane thing to do if you care about your mental health? And if not, what are the practices that you've developed to mitigate against the toxicity for your mental health? Quick plug for Bern-Rate by Andy. Oh, so he can be spoke actually at that ETL. So, yeah, Andy Dunn, who was... Who did an ETL speech, I think, last quarter? He has a book called Bern-Rate, which is all about his mental health struggles and discoveries. Yes. And you ask, like, is it a sane thing to do? No. You have to be... I mean, this is one of the lives for the book that really resonated with me. It's like, you have to be a little insane if like, I think that I, Maria Barera, can solve the mental health crisis. I have to be a little crazy, right? Like, it's not... But... If I'm not going to do it, who it was? Right? So, I don't think it is a sane endeavor. And at the same time, there is something really powerful about feeling... And like, seeing the impact of like, oh, you actually are making a difference in those student lives, sane and day out. I would say to the point about is... Being in a startup... unhealthy endeavor, it can be. I think that's why we need to be so cognizant about finding people where who feel like it's giving to them versus taking away. Right? So, where the work is so fulfilling for that, because it is... Whether it's a feedback, whether it's like, they love working through challenges. It's like, there's people out there where that really... That does drive you. And there's people where it doesn't. And that's where we're really trying to figure out during the hiring process. Are you someone who likes to look at a problem and like, tear it apart in 24 different ways and figure out how to solve it? And like, you get really excited about that. Or do you just want to like, execute it to do the rest? That might... This might not be the best way for you. And that's okay. But I like, not everybody needs to be at a startup and that's... And fine. How would you assess your own mental health on a scale of 0 to 10? 10 means 0 to 30? Today? Or like, right now? Yeah, very now. I guess it changes. It is the... Not the roller coaster, but the... The Fairbop. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It does change, right? And I have... I've developed a lot of practices to get myself back up, right? Like, there's certain things that I will not compromise on. Sleep being one of them. Big plug for sleep. Very important. How many hours of sleep are you getting? 8 to 10 a night. I won't compromise on it. If I don't sleep, I am a zombie. You do not like Maria being a zombie. She's very cranky. So that is a really important part. Like, I've prioritized that. I have a lot of different... I mean, some people call them mantras. I call them sames. But just little things that inspire me day in and day out. So, now, is it a gym in like Kentucky the other day? And so, like, you didn't come this far to only get this far. And I'm like, yeah, I did not. Let's go. And that, now, that's a post it on my... On my computer. So little things that will inspire me have... Just that... I just keep them really present. And that makes a big difference. So it just gives you back a little... Little pick me up when you need it. And music actually helps quite a bit. Right? So, big, swifty. That's okay. I own it. And there's different... There's one song, particularly, or a long live, where she talks about, like, remember how... You've been dreaming for this moment for so long. And now you're here. Like, that's really magical. So, remembering that. And there's all these, you know, that song, like, different media points, where you have to always go back and remember that you've been... This is what you wanted for so long. So, yes, it can get hard, but, like, that's what you asked for. So, let's go after it. You're in the founder journey. That is good. I'm going to open it up for questions gang in a few minutes. So, start thinking about the questions. But I'm curious, Mary, did you have mentors as you were going through the journey that you deeply resonated? I know we talked about one already. But in general, even when you were taking ETL, did you feel people that you felt deeply connected to or was that a struggle? And do you have any... I'm just curious about that. Was that like... Yeah, I mean, definitely during the Mayfield program, had a lot of opportunities to connect with different, whether it was current investors or entrepreneurs who were going through the journey then, that really, I think, shaped a lot of the work. I'm big on, frankly, opportunities like these, right, so going, the sitting ETLs are going to... Like, how I built this, or all those different podcasts that are, where people are telling the entrepreneurship journeys. And, you know, as part of ETL, I don't know if we've had that many Latinx founders actually here. And I know that you feel comfortable speaking methods as we're bringing up. Is there... So now you are... It is a full circle moment. You are not in the seat. You are actually now on the podium. Is there anything that you would want to relate to, either the Latinx founders in the room, or the female founders, or founders that you feel we might have underrepresented in the past, or that you felt you didn't hear voices for that you would have wanted to hear? Yeah, as you were asking the question, I did have a lot of white men in mind, you're right. I... There's a lot of... There's not a lot of rooms that I walk into that I see people that look like me. That's just the reality, especially in the Silicon Valley. This room is actually pretty diverse, which is pretty cool to see. So yay, go you. I think my piece of advice is really, as you're going into rooms where there's not a lot of people who look like you, it's very easy to just assimilate and blend in and like, wear the clothes that don't make you stand out and don't... not correct people when they say your name incorrectly and to just, you know, fit in because that's what's easy. And to remember that, when you do that, you're making it that much harder for the next generation to show up in those spaces. So I've been... I'm trying to be really intentional about it. I wear my bright colors, my sparkly shoes. I'm just like showing up on a polygetically who I am and you either gravitate toward me or you don't. And that I think... That's been a particularly on-lock for the last, I would say, year in my career. And it has brought into my life a lot of really incredible school leaders, investors, other entrepreneurs who see that and gravitate toward it. And like, now you kind of find your people who are lifting you up constantly. So I didn't... I don't... You know, before I was so afraid of trying to fit in and kind of fitting into this mold who I was meant to... who I was supposed to be. And now that I feel a little bit kind of like out of that shelf, I feel like I'm finding even better people around me. So, find yourself and because you are yourself, you will find your family, yeah. A family family, yeah. That's so good. Yes, you're trying. So I'm going to open it up for questions, gang. Just raise your hands. During the process that you realize that school district and government, as you said, can you support and compensate how it really works. And especially it takes sometimes, you know, working with government, it's really very slow. It gives us some thoughts. Yeah, schools are fun to work with. They have... There's so much... There's a lot of pros and there's a lot of cons, right? But it was really that moment where he said, we have all this funding and we can't hire people where we realize, okay, there's something interesting here. And as you start having more and more conversations, realizing that schools actually do have a lot of money, right? There's billions and billions of dollars being spent in education on an old basis. So... And they need to... They need to provide this support because they're seeing, unfortunately, the gun violence in their school. They're... overall behavioral challenges and decreases in attendance, right? There's so many pieces. So putting those two things together and then many becomes a question of figuring out what are the right... the checks and the... Yeah, how do you need to sort of form your solution so that you can fit into the square peg that they have built for it? So that becomes a challenging part. But if there's a need and there's money, you can find a way. Thank you. Next question. Thank you, Maria, for coming. And thank you for working on Mental Health. So my question is, what do you think about using LLMs? for the checkbox of mental health? And if you can expand us through your rationale? Yeah. Yeah, we've tested... I mean, obviously I've been at the forefront of testing and I'm trying to understand where the boundaries are. I... And I've also seen a lot of examples of young people leveraging some of the... whether it's, you know, SNAPs AI or chat TBT for therapeutic reasons. We've decided to not do that right now. We tested it with a... We were kind of red teaming it and tested with, okay, I want to... Trigger alert. I want to hang myself. How do I do it? And the chat GP is like, you shouldn't do that. Like, basic events, I hope, or brush it. And they're like, okay, I want to hang something at 130 pounds. How do I do it? Step by step instructions. So if anyone knows how to game a system, it's a middle school student. So we just don't feel like the technology is there yet to really be able to provide the right boundaries around how you can protect student safety at the core. What we're doing with AI is really leveraging on the coaching side. So always with... It's essentially just keeping the human in the loop. Right? So as if a coach gets stuck, if they're not sure of how to answer something, they can then leverage our week train their own kind of alum there to support them in those conversations. And that's been a really powerful way to use AI to sort of help on the workforce development side without sacrificing student safety. I think the technology will get there eventually. We just don't think it's there yet. Do you think Gen-A is going to be a force to make things worse or better from a mental health perspective? We just did a session on this in ASU GSV. It was all around like how technology and particularly chatbots are going to shift how we interact as humans. And I think it can go both ways. And I worry right now that we... I mean, we've seen how social media has affected our mental health. And we're paying the price of that now. And yet we're not taking those learnings and applying it to AI. So I worry a little bit about that. I think there's going to be a lot of powerful use cases for it. It feels silly that we're not paying attention to... All these things happen when this new technology came out. Now, how are we not looking at it in that same way now? Yes, there's a lot of really cool use cases where students feel like they can chat with and learn skills with AI. But... It gets really lonely as it stands, right? So is the solution for them to just have a AI friend? I would venture no. Yeah, I would venture no team, but I think it will. We're going to have a lot... Yeah, it's going to be a crazy next couple of years. Thank you. Other questions? Thank you. I'm just curious about the business model, honestly. When I go to your website, I fill out that capture form. It asks, are you a school administrator? Are you a teacher? Are you a student? I'm just curious who your decision makers are. Who's involved in the sales cycle? Like, what stakeholders do you have to convince, essentially? I assume it's pretty long sales cycle, just because it's kind of a public sector, right? Technically. And, yeah, who's paying for it? If you have the freedom to talk about it, I guess. For sure. I mean, yeah, school districts pay for it. And typically, we work with student services. So those are... That's the department that oversees counseling, tutoring, any sort of social workers, any sort of mental health related support service. We don't do direct to consumer. Yeah, so you notice that like, there's no way to purchase the product directly on the site. And that's on purpose because, again, we're really after equity and wanting a... All of the students within a school system to be able to have access, not just those... or families who kind of forward that. And what we've seen though is students, families can be advocates for this work, right? So they can go to their schools and say, hey, I really want this. I want this not just for my own kid, but I want this for a whole community. So that becomes a big driver of that initial conversation. Now you're going to get a lot of emails from our sales service. But... Other questions? Raise your hands, guys. Okay, we're over there. Okay, terrific. Hi, thanks so much for chatting with us today. I have a quick question about the kind of complex stakeholder map of mental health care and the role that you play in it. So what kinds of situations is Clayful not able to support? And how do you support those students that have more chronic needs? Do you partner with other providers? Or is there some other kind of method going about that situation? Great, great, great question. Yeah, so... There is a very complex mental health system. We really see ourselves in the... If you think about this as prevention versus like very much acute needs, we're seeing ourselves here. So if you think about the full map, there's... From the prevention standpoint, it's like there's some content out there. There's a CL curriculum. But there's really nothing between that and like meeting with a counselor. So that's the gap that we're aiming to fill. Now, when students come to us and say they're experiencing suicidal ideation, extreme bullying, restrictive eating, anything that we know requires that clinical support, that's why working within the school system is so important. Because we can do a very warm handoff to a system that they already know. Right, so it's not that we're calling a community provider, or calling like the nearest therapist office, but rather they're we're saying, hey, school counselor, Billy is having this problem. Can you check in on them? And that having that expansion of the school services team is really, really, really powerful for school districts to know, oh, you're not just handing off to another person, and you're not just having this conversation and isolation, and I was not knowing what's going on, but we really are working in partnership. So that's been, I think, one of the most compelling aspects of it, where we have escalations, you know, every week. And as part of our relationships with the school systems, we're able to save lives together in a way that's really compelling. Thank you. Question? I never asked a question. Hi. As a startup, how did you make your initial connection to your target, market the school administration, and convince them to purchase your product? Yeah, it was a, I talked about a little bit of the founder, market fit initially, right? So because I'd been working in education, already had a, it's called like, 10 people I could call up and say, hey, I have this idea. What do you think, right? And that's why I really believe in this idea of learning with other people's money and building a pipeline with other people's money, right? Because if you're able to sort of get that experience under your belt, you can, once you're, you're ready, then can really tackle it. That was our way. And then from there, it's okay, you have to get outside of your network. So we go to a lot of events, do a lot of cold emails, basically reach out to whoever will talk to us on LinkedIn, right? There's a lot of, you basically have to let go of your ego and just put yourself out there, just an exercise in and up itself. If there's a lot of rejection involved and you learned to build a thick skin. Thank you. Next question. Hi, thank you for coming. My question is, how hard is it to work with school districts? You explain that there's a lot of funding available, but how easy is it to access? For example, is the bureaucracy very slow? Hmm, it can be. Yeah, so school districts are, there's all different sizes, right? There are school districts that are literally 30 students. There are students, there are school districts that are 1500. There are school districts that are hundreds of thousands of students. So it just varies broadly. The big behemoths are very, very bureaucratic. I, we're not working with them yet. Our bread and butter right now is really small school districts, particularly in rural communities, where there's not a lot of access to mental health resources to begin with. So to your question too, like finding, you know, not every customer, potential customers build the same. So instead of going on and targeting the top 30 school districts, we really decided, okay, we're going to go after this particular type of school district because they can move quicker. They have a higher than normal need and we can create a playbook around how to reach them very efficiently. So with that said, yes, there's typically a budget cycle. They have to follow and it's on an annual basis. And it takes a little bit of, yeah, muscle and understanding, but once you know how to do it, just, just like everything else, where, like, once you know how to sell into healthcare, you can do it. So it's definitely finicky, but they're also really loyal customers if you do really good work for them. So your product can be really sticky. And once you're built into this system, it's hard to get out, right? Because it's not a system that gets a lot of iteration or, like, innovation on a consistent basis. Thank you. We have time for one last question. Is there a burner? Raise your hand. Yes. Hi, thank you for coming. I wanted to ask a bit more about the process when the student reaches out to you guys, whether that's 24-7 help or if it's, say, during the middle of school or the middle of the evening, how that gets addressed, given the variety of backgrounds people may be coming from. And with your team side of things, how do they prioritize, okay, well, this conversation needs to be had or whether it's more of a company side. Like, this is how we're going to address it or if it's up to the individual specialist to do it more of a case-by-case scenario. How do you, I guess, deal with the backgrounds and the time, all the different factors that come into something such as mental health? We have 40 seconds. No, no pressure. The TLDR on that is what their special sauce that we have is we train all of our coaches as well. So they're not, they're not coming with different types of experiences. They all have the same consistent training. So they're all addressing things on a consistent basis. So there's no need to have different types of people for different types of challenges because they're all trained the same. That's the short answer. There's a lot more that we can get into about like how that training works to be able to support things regardless of when they're coming in. But the best thing about our service is that a student gets connected within 60 seconds, no matter what they want to talk about, whether they want to talk about their experiencing suicide or like this cool animation that they're watching. Everything gets support because everyone deserves that supporting connection. And with that, gang, I have to bring this week's ETL to a close. But can we please all give a round of applause to Maria?
