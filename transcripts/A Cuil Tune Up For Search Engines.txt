 You were listening to the Entrepreneurial Thought Leader series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures program. You can find podcasts and video clips of these lectures online at edcorner.stanford.edu. So it really, great pleasure to introduce Anna Patterson to you. Anna, think of Anna as somebody who's on the frontier of one of the most interesting phenomena in human history. And that is the explosion of content that's available to us all on the web. If you think about the promise of the web going back to the first time you heard of Google or the internet, the promise was easy access to information. The problem, fast forward 10 or 12 years, is that easy creation of information and easy indexing of information just was, is not the whole story. So Anna has built her career first at a company called Recall that she built and sold to Google, which actually turns out to be a good thing to aspire to do in your career. Then at Google where she was a leadership, held leadership positions in both some of the indexing key indexing functions like Google Base, as well as some of the ranking functions around sort of deciding what web content was going to be first, second, or third in the rankings. Big, big jobs. She's really on the forefront in the frontier of trying to organize the universe of information that's out there and make it accessible to folks. And we're really thrilled to have her here because she's going to talk to us about her new venture, which is called Cool, spelled C-U-I-L, but pronounced Cool. And we can maybe hear a little bit about what the origin of that is. She's going to talk to us about that venture. And we're going to learn what it's like to be one of the few people in the entire planet who sticks their hand up and says, I can do it better than Google. So oh, I should also say where you went to school. Anna earned her PhD in computer science at University of Illinois. And then she became a research scientist here at Stanford. So she's, I guess, coming home in a way today. So let's hear from Anna and thank you for giving her your attention. This is bringing back a nightmare I had many years after finishing school that his announcement about people not signing up to the class. I'd have this nightmare about not showing up to the final. I bet no one else has ever had that nightmare. So I was trying to figure out today what students would want to hear who are going to an entrepreneur's seminar. I figured maybe many of you are interested in starting your own companies or being the first few employees at a company. And so what I've done is tried to think about the startups that I've done or the startups I've been part of. And what were the big lessons learned along the way? And I really encourage people to interrupt me at any time. One of the things I loved about Stanford is that the students didn't mind interrupting. So I wrote the talk to be interactive. So as he said, I got my undergraduate at Washington University in St. Louis. I got my PhD from UIUC, but actually my advisor went on an extended sabbatical. And during that time he sent me out to Stanford to be a visiting student. And then I returned to be a research scientist. Everybody in those days in 1998 seems like yesterday to me, but I looked at the years today putting together this talk and realized, of course, it was 10 years ago. That the calls of computer science in those days were like hollowing out. We had entrepreneurs like Jerry and Dave. And I don't know how to stop this, there we go. And we had a Graham Spencer from Excite. He was pitching his ideas in the halls of computer science. And one of the things about all the companies that came out of Stanford computer science department, of which there are a lot of successes and a lot of failures is that at the time they were pitching as a student, we couldn't tell which was which. So I thought about putting down a slide of all the companies I turned down, which everybody at Stanford will be able to do. And then all the companies you thought about joining and you'd see that actually, you know, my taste wasn't so good. So it's very interesting to be at Stanford because I think one of the great things was the entrepreneurial spirit at Stanford. So I wasn't alone in leaving Stanford to go to startup land. I left first to go to Sphera, then I did my own startup. Then I went to a nonprofit at the Internet Archive and I'm going to talk about each of these experiences. Someone else's startup and then cool. So on my personal journey, these are my four kids. And I thought as a student, I would never have any. And there's no good time, but there they are. So. So first when I joined Sphera, I was the second engineer. And as I said from my taste, it was a very interesting company and doing applications for. For stock brokers, which really wasn't my thing. I did learn though at that small startup that it doesn't really matter if your five people or eight people or 20 people that management is really important. I mean, you hear a lot about self organizing companies and. And that management, I think the trend is that management isn't very important. But I think it's really key when you get into a situation where you see. You know, management work and management not work that you learn that it really can make a difference. I did a startup in 1999, which was ZIFT. And it tried to organize the content of the web, which was very, very, very small back then. Five million pages was considered big. So we had a five million page index in 1999 as a proof of concept. And I learned a lot about timing. You know, that timing is really luck. And it's bad luck to have bad timing and good luck to have good timing. And so I think one of the things when you're doing a startup, one of the things you cannot get by without is execution. So at that time, the team was really good at executing and really bad at kind of sticking to the mission. It was a small company and you can be really set at Drift when you're looking for funding. So we had our core demo and then you're out looking for money and VCs say, oh, you know, actually that thing is, you know, your team seems great, but this other area is really hot. And then while we were, you know, young just out of school. So we said, well, we'll do that other thing, right? I mean, we're good engineers. We'll do that other thing. Then we'd go out to VCs again and they'd say, really good team. This other thing is really hot, right? I mean, it was, I see some nods in the audience. So people, you know, know what I'm talking about. And so we took the advice and we, you know, ran out of money, took angel money, and we just went from one project to another. So we were good at getting the projects done and, you know, the market crashed and we were out of money. So timing was bad and kind of not sticking to your mission and your beliefs and sticking with what you're good at is ultimately going to be bad for your startup. I went to a nonprofit as a volunteer because I actually needed to be a stay-at-home mom for a while. I was having a difficult pregnancy with the second of the four kids. My doctor said I needed to be on bed rest and I said, well, can I program? So it's very similar to being very stationary for anyone who does program here. So as some people do, I got into the project and I really couldn't let go. So I kept programming up a search engine for recall.archive.org. When I launched it, it was 12 billion pages and it was by far the biggest search engine in the world. When I launched it, Yahoo! was at two and Google was at three. And recall had the interesting property of indexing pages over time because the internet archive is a nonprofit that tries to archive all the internet content that's gone on and they take crawls as donations. So their primary donation source is from Alexa and now cool is donating to the archive as well. So everything we crawl will get saved for posterity at the internet archive. So that's why the 12 billion search engine was bigger than the number of pages that were on the web at the time because it took snapshots of the web. The nonprofits also taught me amazing things about management because you're trying to organize people who aren't getting paid. So what you have to do is you have to really inspire the employees and that's really important in a startup as well. Because at a startup, you're often underpaying with respect to the broad market. So you really need to have a team that really believes in your vision and at the internet archive or any nonprofit that you get involved in and volunteer. That's one of the founding organizing principles around it is that the people there believe in the vision. And another lesson that the industry has taught you over and over again is that small teams make a big difference. But you can really, when you sit at any nonprofit, they're giving books out to people who've never had books before and they're doing all these very worthy causes. And so it's worth showing up. So I said I learned a lot on the way down. You can learn a lot on the way up too. So after the internet archive, some companies asked me whether the intellectual property for recall was owned by me since I was a volunteer. So I went off to Google. And I was approximately, I don't know the exact number, 800th engineer. And believe it or not, at 800, it still felt like a very small company because there were some people in ads and some people in other properties. But as far as the core people in search, it still felt like a startup. So I went into the search group to work on spam and ranking to citing what top 10 results are put on the front page. And then I managed a group there. And then with the explosion of the web, Google decided that with other search engines launching, it might be better to index more pages. So I architected and led Terra Google, which is Google's big index. And that project took almost two years. I also had teams in ads and ran Google Base. So I think there, even though it's a big company now thinking about it as a startup, it went through phenomenal growth. And it grew eight times the size in the time I was there. So it was really managed chaos. So you could see a different style of management. And you could also see again, market timing, where they got funded right before the crash. There weren't a lot of people funded right after them. They had enough money to last as excite, fell, and altavista fell. And they had an amazing product. But they also had really good luck in terms of competition from startups and good luck in terms of either bad acquisitions, where the excite and ad home merger was strange, altavista being spun off out of deck. And I learned also a different style of execution, more similar to the internet archive, where it's ground up. And I think one of the amazing things about succeeding at Google is sticking to your mission. So I learned a lot of the same things again, but it was very nice to know that the same lessons that you learned on the way up. But so now I'm doing cool. I have two co-founders, Tom Costello, who got his PhD from the Department of Computer Science at Stanford. I got his PhD from John McCarthy in knowledge. What is a representation? And Russell Powers from the University of Washington. And he was with me at Google. So this time, we actually think we're a little bit, I know it sounds strange, a little bit lucky on timing, because we did get to raise money. And now I hear that it's harder to raise money right now than it was nine months ago. So I hope no one's graduating soon, I want to start a company. So we launched our VZero site this summer. And it's a 125 billion page index. And I think Michael Deering, when he was introducing me, noted the explosion. So luckily it's in engineering, so you won't mind that I plotted on a log scale. But don't plot on a log scale for VCs. Sorry. So the web has grown super exponentially because it still looks like an exponentially even plotted on log scale. And you can see when each of these properties came on the market. So when altivista came on the market, it indexed over 50% of the web. And when Google launched, it indexed about 50% of the web. So as the web has grown, people need to buy a certain amount of hardware in order to index a certain amount of information. And so obviously you can't just invest exponentially in hardware. So search engines really haven't kept up with the exponential growth of the web. So we thought that provided an opportunity for cool because rather than buying more machines, Tom, our co-founder, actually did some mathematics in order to come up with a mathematical model about how to build a search engine differently. So a standard search engine is built as a scatter gather architecture. I don't know how many people know that terminology. But basically, it would be like asking every single one of you the same question and you guys emailing me back the answer. So you scatter the query and you gather up the answer. So he came up with a representation so that you didn't have to scatter the query anywhere that over 95% of queries could just go to one machine. And with that, it means that you can have architecture that's entirely on disk instead of in memory. If I have to ask every single one of you a query and you're all computers, that I'm going to have to use the memory because it's going to take too long in the latency of the network to get the question out to you. Have you compute the answer and get it back to me? So the latency is high, so the computation on each of the machines needs to be low. So he said, well, let's spend the latency instead going to disk and doing lots of computation. So it does lots of computation on the mathematical model in order to figure out the answer. So that's why on 140 machines, we can serve 125 billion pages. And trust me, Yahoo and Google use more. Yeah. I look a lot at a machine. Yeah. Yeah, there are eight gig machines, 12 disks. So one of the resource communication is also not the first for second you can serve. Yeah. It's actually bigger from the point of not real machine, right? So when you have one cluster and it has to go to each machine, then you're really limited to a thousand QPS because per cluster, because you just have to get every query through every machine. Whereas here, since queries go to different machines, then you can have more QPS. So the network isn't working. So I think one of the things about building a search engine that has so many pages is you don't want, you want to break through from a single list into tools that try to help you sort through the information and to tell you about the information. So in our first launch, what we have is we have tabs at the top to try to put different ideas automatically filed in different buckets. And then we have some categories over here where I always forget what the Harry Potter books are. So if you hover over them, it'll tell you what book that was in the series, Deathly Hollows. I don't know, six. So we've learned all this information on the web automatically. And so it can help drive finding out more. And so what we're trying to get towards is the computer thinking about all the information that comes back from the search and synthesizing it and processing it in a way to let you interact with it differently. Interact with it through graphs, interact with it through different methods. So first we extract all the structured information in the back before we even serve information, part of the mathematical model needs to learn about the structure of the web. So we actually go through not just one time indexing it, we go through the web 12 times. And that provides the basis for the serving architecture, but it provides a way of organizing the data. So we're working now on different UIs to try to let people see what's behind the data and analyze it for them. Let's see, lessons from starting this company. Well, we're better at raising money than it's ift when we had a vision that floated around a lot. The strange lesson we learned was that the day we launched nothing else happened in the whole world. We actually talked to very few reporters and then we heard that the day we launched, we got like 300 television spots that day. So in Ireland they'd say an angel passed, which meant everything was dead silent. And the other lesson is that predicting user patterns, I think a lot of startups do this of just try something, see whether users like it. And that's a really good model because it is very hard to predict from focus groups and some in-house user tests, what people are really going to like and what they don't. So that's my half an hour of advice to starting entrepreneurs. Yeah. Why would something as cool as a solution except Google and kind of different users? I think one of the things is that we're trying to show you the meanings of the search. So if you search for Tesla instead of letting one meaning kind of overtake all the others, we really tried to, and the search engine world is called diversity, try to show you, oh, actually there's different meanings for that. And here's kind of a result in each of the meanings rather than saying, oh, all the popular Tesla things mean the cars, which isn't really popular outside of Silicon Valley. Sorry, he knows the founder. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, John, you're late. I'm just teasing. Okay. I have two questions. Yeah. First, you talked about bad timing and good timing. And if you are lucky and you would have good timing, how can you reduce that luck factor? And then my second question is, it looks like the inner mechanism of your product is something that Google would be really interested in like using because you would reduce their hardware cost very significantly. What's your, what are your thoughts about being acquired? Okay, so repeating John's question. First, he asked, second, he asked what my thoughts were on being acquired. And first, oh, yeah, I know. So could you repeat your first question? I hate to do a Sarah Paylon on you guys. How can you reduce the luck factor? Yeah. Well, one thing is, you know, if you have friends that are investors or friends that are entrepreneurs or friends who are going through the funding cycle, I think that you need to listen to them. I think, you know, there wasn't too long ago where I really heard from a lot of my friends into looking rally, oh man, you know, two guys with PowerPoint, it's time to get funding again, you know, because back in 1999, that was kind of a feeling, you know, two guys and idea, PowerPoint, no revenue model could get funding. So it was just, you know, those, when everybody else is raising money, it's usually a sign that the VCs are funding at that time. And then, you know, if you want to talk about, you know, super concrete things, I mean, you can read venture beat, it's open and public and they talk a lot about the deals that are happening. If you don't see deals printed there like every day or every few days, then, you know, it's going to be harder. And they also print stories about, you know, good companies that failed to raise money. So that's a source you can use beyond, you know, your friends in the class. And as far as getting acquired, I mean, we're, you know, we're trying to focus on the product. I think that if you, a lot of companies are built to be acquired and I think what happens there is you leave yourself in a really vulnerable spot because you're growing and you say, hey, I won't hire that expensive whatever, VP of whatever, because, hey man, any day now we're going to get acquired and then your product lines up suffering. So I think you need to really want to do the company because you don't know how long you're going to be at it. And luckily, I've been in search a long time. I know I want to stay in search. So you know, it's fine with me whatever happens with a company, but you have to focus on building the product and making the product better and you have to focus on building a sustainable company. Yeah. How many things you have to speak with and when you present for the venture that's been made a presentation and maybe a small part of that is about the technology? How many, I mean, some venture that's just eight slides is about different topics, but how many slides did you actually present about the architecture and technology? Yeah. How many slides did I present about the architecture and technology? I do believe when you're talking to VCs, I aim for ten slides. So I kind of don't count the title slide in that. I don't count the slide at the end that you say questions, question mark or whatever. But you know, ten slides in the middle, architecture and technology, probably three. You know, some venture guys are just deathly interested in technology and those are probably the ones that get along with me and some, you know, aren't. So you know, they're more interested in the team and on the plans and ideas and, you know, and with a lot of these guys, right, they're quite, I think one of the things that you forget is a lot of these guys are quite wealthy. They have their choice of good ideas that are going to make them money. It really is about the fit from both sides. You have to work with them. They have to work with you. You guys have to click. How many do we meet with? Oh, how many do we meet with? Let's see. A lot of people offer us funding. So for Series A, I think we had five or so offers and maybe two rejections. Some people you just don't get very far down the pike with. So that's probably about it. And then for Series B, we contacted around the same number and then wound up seeing five people. Yeah. I don't know if you're aware, but I think last year we could buy the pattern for why technician on search. So I don't think you're doing anything in that direction or what other plans on that. Or that's how the future is going to be. You speak and then recognize the new tools. You know, when I was a student, I did a search engine when I was a graduate student that was really, this is the thing about the computer science department. I was completely made fun of because I did the search engine where you would hum into it. And it would match the song because I was really into music and I kept going into the music store saying, you know, that song and I think hum a little bit of it and they never know. But then I did a search engine where I indexed the wave files and if you hums at pretty much just the right beat, the tone didn't matter. That's what humans were thrown off by with me. It would come up with some songs and if you preferred more recent songs, then it was pretty good. And I got really, really made fun of for my early interest in search. But as far as using voice for search, I think it's going to be really great for mobile. You can use your location, some keywords. It's very hard across all cultures, all accents and everything to get voice recognition just right. But really naive, and I mean people in the area where they were naive algorithms can get words like restaurant, you know, because you have a fixed vocabulary of keywords you're looking for and then you have the more expanded vocabulary. That's how you can use the keyword you recognize, like restaurant and then Evia to say, okay, restaurant, it narrows it down to these restaurants and they have to be close, etc. So I think it's a good idea. But I hope to see that feature in the old stuff coming out. Yeah. Two questions. One, have you thought about location dates or, you know, inter-experial school and second, you know, at words, obviously, and that revenue model is something that we're really sure about. Yeah, we are going to have ads revenue model. We haven't turned on ads yet because, you know, we think the product, you know, we need more work and we have limited engineering resources. So it's just part of a management decision to slot in ads a little bit later. And about location based search, I think that for every webpage, if you can know a location, I think it's very good and it's something that we have a project on. It's not something that we have in our index right now. Yeah. So in light of current economic conditions, I wonder what changes you have made to your spend, your primalize to revenue break even acquisition, maybe you can change it to your mission to rather not change, but in light of what you're going to do. What we've done is we have, we're so old, we actually tried to make plans and stuff. So right now, we are actually looking out on a nine month time horizon and looking at changing our plans and even changing the time we bring on revenue. And we're looking at, we had a hiring ramp and we're going to slow the hiring ramp that we projected. And as far as slowing the spend on money, on machines, we're going to do that a little bit. But we launched with enough machines to launch. And then you can't run a factory and also do development to make the factory better. So we're really buying the minimum number of machines. We can get away with in order to make the product better, but also keep the index fresh. Yeah. Can you talk about what motivated you about the privacy policy that this was mentioned? And it's really exciting. I'm just ready to do this. Yeah. Well, one of the things that motivated us is the technology. Because what we do when we go through the web in order to come up with the models of the pages and the way the concepts and the ideas on the pages interact, we realized we wanted to get away from some of this day on this. You see on the web. So direct hit, a lot of people don't remember it. But if you clicked on a result, it would promote the result. If people didn't click on it, it would demo the result. So you can imagine if something ever got to the front page, essentially it gets some clicks. It would always stay there. So I think one of the amazing beauties about the web, when I remember the web when it first came out, is that there was always this artful page on whatever Harry Potter. And what the world created was always changing. The main fan was always changing. And so the pages were always changing. So I really wanted to make a conscious effort to uncover those zealots out there about their particular topic that changes over time. And I did a lot of mining at the archive to see these things change over time. So when we made that decision, we realized we didn't actually have to track any individual user habits. So actually came out of the technology decision. We realized that because we'd made one technology and product decision, we could make this other decision on the privacy. You mentioned earlier about the management payoff. Yeah. The already based on Google. Yeah. What do you think that drives Google to think of this unconventional management style, or internal operating style? And do you think it's more of an asset? And whether you're a few moves, sort of saying the style of the user company? Yeah. So he asked whether a more chaotic management style was an asset. I mean, I think when your company is growing really fast and when you need to react to outside events, I think chaotic management style is really great. I mean, I think if you have a mainframe type of business where everybody puts in their orders, ages in advance and asks for certain features, then you have to meet your customer needs and you have to manage your engineers to meet those deadlines for their customers, whatever the banking customers are, whatever they need in that quarter. But when you're trying to, just now, the other question about the market, I think when you're trying to react to the changing dynamic marketplace, I think it's really nice to have more flexibility. Where it's not like, oh, these engineers are totally on plan and no one can leave. So it's a lot more free flowing and not, I have my 20 engineers and don't take any of them. Yeah. Sort of like a same line. A lot of people talk about the culture of the company and how they try to hire people within that culture. Yeah. What was your ideal and your ideal culture in your family? Well, I mean, one of the things about our culture, I guess, so my Tom is from Ireland's, I'm Irish citizen as well. So I would kind of joke around and call it a pub culture. That it's not that we go out of drinking, it's more that, you know, conversation, people have to be able to hold a long conversation and they have to like being together because you're together just so many hours. So our first interview, I think somebody blogged about it last week, but our first interview was taking the person out to lunch because if they can't hang with us for one hour, three people at lunch, then the end hours a day we're going to have to spend with them is just going to be no. So we really try to go for, you know, something that looks good on paper, then they get into lunch and then just, you know, fun to talk to you. I mean, they have to be able to talk about movies and, you know, whatever. I mean, I know it sounds strange, but you always get off topic when you're working and you want somebody that has, you know, somebody who's nice to be around. And then we like people that have had other projects. We find, you know, like a lot of undergrounds who have a small project on the side or have consulted or whatever, we find that the kind of people that have, you know, multiple balls in the air are great and people have been at other startups. They're amazing. Yeah. Can you speak a little bit more about your UI design? Like, what made you come up with a calm layout? Yeah. I think it's interesting that, you know, if you're concentrating on a linear list, then what you're doing is you're really concentrating on pretty much the top hit or the top one or two hits. And so, you know, what we tried to do is, you know, if you study user studies, you know, they say the hotspot of the eye, if you do eye tracking studies, is in a certain realm. And in that realm, on a linear search engine, you're going to see ads and one hit or ads and two hits. And because we're trying to, you know, promote diversity of information shown on the web page, you know, the first hit, you know, might be, you know, Tesla Motors or something, but the next meaning might be the one you wanted. So we actually were trying to show you the most information and we actually played around with, you know, a two column design and, you know, or different ways of interacting. And, you know, I don't think, you know, it's one of the things that you get to do when you're a startup is to say, you know, we'll start here and we'll evolve, you know. And actually, the interesting thing is that because it's more magazine layout, some people think the top middle hit is the first hit. Some people think the top left. But they're not, but on the eye tracking studies, people aren't reading it as linearly. They're kind of going around in a circle. Do you think that will help? You know, if you look at both e-maps, you know, most of their clicks are on the top left corner, whether it be in the number of organic heads or at-awards, do you think that will help your, you know, your revenue model for ads in future since people are coming in everywhere? I think that, you know, the thing that will, you know, hopefully help ads in the future is that because we go through the web 12 times before we even present the information, we kind of have a lot of knowledge about what the topic is about. And then hopefully we'll be able to see, okay, from this ad, what is that page about? And just basically be able to do better matching. Yeah. Another very familiar with Colbert from the first point of view, first view, sorry. What I really like is that you were both on the architecture problem, but also on the user interface and the user experience. Would you say that it's the, you know, technology problem or the user experience that's the core added value of Colbert? Yeah, I think the point about, you know, being able to save current search engines money is true only for the architecture, but if we didn't have the architecture, we wouldn't be able to serve up, you know, as many pages. And like a 1 billion page search engine right now feels like a toy if you've seen them around. And so really we wanted to build a web scale search engine, so we had to solve the first one. But we think the user experience, it's all tied up. So at a lot of places, you know, you have user experience group and you have a ranking group. But here, there's a lot of stuff in the index just to drive user experience. So if you don't own your index, you don't really own your user experience. All you can do is, you know, reorder them or whatever. But all this information that we know and how we can drive interactions among the results is all because we own our own index. Yeah. On the back end of the architecture, it seems like a lot of the stuff we've innovated on is we're going to ask you on the idea of trying to use disks if they're anything. Yeah. And I'm wondering if you've got thoughts on how that changes when SSD is everywhere and we could set up a cluster like that for the architecture of the parts that is cost you the way people can. I don't know about a tenth, but I think when you have, you know, basically random access disks that are, you know, then going to be much cheaper than memory per gig, I think then the architecture that's currently used is going to be good again. I really don't know what those devices, you know, latency are now, but I think in the future, you know, going out 15 years, I think that, you know, where the current architectures will be fine, but that all the information and the data mining and the mathematical models will still hold. As a startup, how important do you think it is to have just the right team and the right startup versus having all sort of the bells and whistles of, you know, knowing the right people and branding and marketing and all of that? I'll pretend Vince isn't here. I really think having the right team and I think having the right team and the right people is important. I think knowing someone is important. I don't think that there's been, you know, so many startups created by people, you know, who weren't insiders. And so I don't think it's important. I think it becomes important to know people actually when your startup isn't going perfectly because then you can leverage the other students and your network of trust to say, yeah, well, we're just going through a hard time, but we know what we're doing and, you know, that kind of thing. So, if you're trying to raise money, you know, in a down-round or, you know, like a lot of startups are doing now, I think the ones that are being successful are the ones who are leveraging their networks. Yeah. I'm a little curious about the four-eyed tax on the land. Yeah. You can build the areas, your ads and, you know, you can talk a little about that and this looks like 88,000 matches for hard-hurted products. Yeah, it was. There are many things going on. Yeah, I think my live page says a lot more than that. This picture was taken a long time ago. I thought I'd have live access. That's fine. No, that's fine. Yeah. So, you know, what we're trying to do is to say of all the things that we know about this posting list, you know, all the results that come back. You know, what are the categories that kind of get triggered for each of these things? So we've pre-computed in the data mining phase a bunch of relationship, you know, author of book seven of series, that kind of stuff. And then we put things into categories and then we just see naturally from the results that come up and then the ranking. So because sometimes, you know, if the results come up for Harry Potter, maybe the most popular category might be hotels because there's maybe so much hotel spam in Harry Potter tale somewhere. But then you use ranking and then try to trigger the categories off of the most popular pages, the most popular million pages. Yeah. So sort of the idea of having a huge index seems a little counterintuitive to me. Yeah. So what extent do you see pages in the long tail of that that like aren't indexed by other certain things appearing on first page? Yeah. And to what extent do you use those for calculating anything in a pre-pass before actually returning queries? So anything that we see beforehand, we've kind of calculated in a pre-pass. It's also really hard to predict what content people will want tomorrow. One of the way query patterns work is, you know, that some little town in Germany is having an October fast and all of a sudden it's popular next week and you know what is not actually popular again for a year. So when you're trying to predict the patterns, you know, basically the best predictor is random. And so if the best predictor is random, then, you know, if you see a webpage, you better index it. So yeah. Here's to how you and the rest of the following team met, posted at Google and specifically did you look for the person that was perfect for the job or do you resort to people you already trusted and you highly appreciated? I resorted to people I trusted, but I wouldn't call it resorted. It's a feature, not a bug. So I met Tom at Stanford in 1994 and I met Google, I met Russell at Google in 2004. He started a week before me. So as such, he knew everything and I didn't, you know, that's how fast the company was moving in those days. Yeah. Yeah. The link off of this question just gives it so hard for you to make use of like results in the long self engineering research. It's cool thinking about opening up its index or creating some type of platform for the developers to add their own like relevant rankings, it's actually a few systems. I know, you know, Google did something like that under Guja to allow people to make, let's say, a rare childhood disease search engine or whatever by people who are really interested in that. I think that's for a startup, you know, where focus and priorities has to come in. And for us, actually, surfacing stuff from the tail that's really, really good is kind of our focus rather than trying to return, you know, the same sites that everyone else sees. So we're trying to kind of pick up these gems from nowhere. Yeah. So I have a question about searching. So I was walking with a friend of mine by the lake here and we saw this like weird animal on the ground and we were like, what is that? And she was like, I'm going to take a picture with my iPhone. Is that possible to insert that picture as your query and get results just based on that picture? No. I think I like is trying to do that for shoes or something like that. I like, you know, so if you see like Jennifer Lopez's shoes in a magazine or whatever, you can try to figure out. Yeah. So when you're in Google, how much earlier were you thinking about an idea for cool and what was the final spark that said maybe you just signed up and thought about it last year? So what happened is as you saw the picture of the four kids, I was coming back from maternity leave with my fourth kid into a company that was 16,000 people and I was coming back to an org of, you know, ranking and their live site and Google base and ads project that was launching and it was really, really overwhelming. And you know, I knew I had to simplify. So there was, you know, two paths to, you know, give up a bunch of groups at Google or, you know, start something small and just at that time Tom was out looking for funding in the search space and he pitched me this, you know, new mathematical representation and because I had built search engines before I was intrigued whether it would work. And so I was, it was pretty sold by the mathematics. Yeah. I'll take the last quote, there's one there. How many children loved with your being? Cool Tom is from Ireland and cool is the declination of call and that's the Irish for wisdom. So maybe last question and I know you're going to be hanging around for follow ups from the students but what advice would you give Jerry Yang about the search business today? I think, you know, when I first saw Microsoft's offer, I felt it was really great timing on Microsoft's part. Jerry had just stood up to a stockholders and said, you're not going to see the share price for three years. And if you see the share price in three years, it's because we're going to be good at executing on this new plan. I think based on their previous history, executing on a new plan wasn't super, super believable by the shareholders. And so I think Microsoft came up with a good offer and a good time. And if I were Jerry, I probably would have taken my management team and said, okay, and I like seriously guys, what about this plan? Is it going to work? And probably would have had an offsite with them for a few days. And then gone home and cried all weekend. I know, forgot you can't say that. So maybe not for Jerry. And then on Monday, I would have taken the offer. So okay. He didn't. Yeah. And in some ways, maybe he even landed in a worse spot, which is he both rejected the offer and somewhat abandoned the original plan for upgrading and overhauling the way they approach search and advertising. Now today, in the last 24 hours, we learned that Google is no longer going to be offering them their services to help out. What do you do now? Yeah, I think he would, gosh, I hope he doesn't see this. No, I think he should get back to basics. And he has some trust to be rebuilt with his engineers. I think when you're talking Microsoft wants to buy you because your engineering force is so great and they are. And then he says, but actually, we're going to outsource it to Google, leaving it kind of vague so that engineers felt they weren't valued. And so now you're going to try to rev up that team to believe in the mission again and to press forward. I think it's going to be very, very hard, but I think that's what he has to do to get things back on track. Makes sense. So, thank you very much. I know the students have a presentation and I thank you from the class. Okay. Thank you.
