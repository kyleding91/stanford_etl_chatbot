 Without further ado, I would like to introduce Jeff. Jeff is one of my favorite people. I am such a huge fan. In fact, I have an autograph copy of his book, which I treasure. Now, Jeff, okay, fine. You all know that he was a founder of Palm One, and a handspring, and a Redwood neuroscience institute, and of Numenta, but you know what, that's not why. I think he's amazing. You know what, around here, founders are a dime a dozen. But what I think is so amazing about Jeff is that he is a perfect model of someone who follows their passions. He is a passionate neuroscientist, and I have to tell you so am I. And I am thrilled to see how he has taken his fascination with neuroscience and used incredible creativity to start a brand new, very, very exciting company and to write a really defining book about how the human brain works called on intelligence. So, I want to tell you, the last time Jeff was here was in October 2002. And it's really funny. It doesn't seem like it was that long ago. And the reason is, we captured the videos here, and we bring those videos back to our lab at FTP, and we put them on a website called the Educators Corner. I'm giving a little plug here. And we use the video clips from these lectures in our courses. And it's something I invite all of you to go look at. So if you end up wanting to hear more from Jeff, or more from any of other speakers, you can easily go to the Educators Corner website and learn more. So without further ado, Dev Hocken. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Wow. Well, that's an ice introduction. Thank you. I hope I can live up to it. I thank you for inviting me here, Tina and Josh, and whoever organized this event like at the basis in Solom. As Tita mentioned, I've been here before. And it was about three years ago. And so it's kind of risky coming back, because I have the two choices. One is, of course, I can't remember what I talked about before, although they have it on video. I can either contradict myself or I could repeat myself. Those are the two options. And neither one's particularly desirable. So I'm going to try to do neither. I'm going to try to talk about some new things and hopefully not repeat myself too much. The other thing I want to say is I'm going to talk about my, I'm going to give you some advice. And as people say, you know, advice is worth what you pay for it. And I'm not getting paid for anything here. So you can do the math. Perhaps you're paying to be here. I don't know. But the point of this is that what worked for me may not work for you. I'm going to tell you about what's worked in my life and what hasn't worked in my life. And you'll have to extract your own lessons from that as you go forward. OK. So the summer in my talk is basically, I'm going to talk a little bit about what entrepreneurship is and isn't. And the basic lesson there is I've used as a tool that should be used sparingly and as a last resort. It's not a job. It's a tool. The second I'm going to do is I'm going to talk about examples from my life when I decided to use the entrepreneurial tool. And times when I decided not to use the entrepreneurial tool. And it's going to give you some insights into how those decisions were made. Finally, I'm going to talk about lessons I've learned. It's just to summarize the previous points in the talk. I'm going to do this in this sort of two tracks. I have these. This is what's new from the last time I was here. I'm going to talk about my industry track and my science track. So as Tina mentioned, I've had sort of these two passions in my life. One is in the mobile computing arena. Many years ago, 25 years ago, I decided that, hey, mobile computing is a pretty important thing. And that was a way we built small computers and inexpensive and so on. We can make them accessible to a larger populous in the world. And that would be a desirable thing to do. Also, 25 years ago, right now I got out of school. I fell in love with brains. And since I'll talk about a little bit, I'll just give you a little preference to it. I saw that human brain seemed like one of the greatest scientific mysteries we had that we could solve in our lifetime. That we had a lot of knowledge about the human brain, but we had no theories about how it worked. I really know good theories. And that just seemed like something we could do accomplishing my lifetime. And we have a lot of really great benefits. I would tell us about who we are. That tells us about how you have conflict in the world, why we have prejudices, why we make decisions, and ultimately to a really amazing technology as we build machines that work in the same principles. So I set that as a goal early in my life to work on that problem and try to solve it. So those are the two tracks in my life. And I tried to balance them both throughout my career, which is about 26 years going now. On the computer side, the mobile computing side, I started two companies, Palm Computing and Hanspring. Those companies are now combined into one company called Palm One, which I am the CTOO. On the science side, I've started two things, two entrepreneur and one is a nonprofit, the Redwood Neuroscience Institute, which is in Memo Park. And the other is a recently formed company, Numenta, which is going to promote some of the technologies and theories that came out of R&I. So let me now just jump into the first part of my talk, which is what is entrepreneurism and what isn't. I always laugh when people come up to me and they say, I want to be an entrepreneur. And I say, I feel like, it's not a thing to be. It's a transitionary thing. It's like one step from being unemployed. It's a tool. It's like being a student. It's good to be a student, but you don't want to be one for your whole life. And by definition, a successful entrepreneur is one who, a person who actually, you design yourself out of that job. It's a temporary thing. If you succeed, you have something you've created, whether it's a business or an institute or a foundation of some sort. And there is no room for an entrepreneur at that point at any time. It's a temporary thing used to start something. Some people say, it's great to be a serial entrepreneur, although that sounds to me like, serial killer or something like that. There's just the serial prefix that doesn't have good connotations. So I think the lesson here is that the entrepreneurism is something, it's a tool, and it's actually I'm going to argue a tool of last resort. It should be the last thing you do in desperation because you couldn't figure out any other way of accomplishing what you want to accomplish. Now what it's good for is it's good for accomplishing or progressing some sort of goal or passion. I'm going to argue that everyone should try to find a passion or goal in their life. Tina mentioned when she introduced me. And then you pursue that. And when you come across obstacles and of course the more difficult and challenging the goal you've set for yourself, the more obstacles you'll run across, entrepreneurism is a tool that you can use to further your goals. Most companies are started with some sort of passion or goal or belief or enthusiasm for something. The companies are formed because, hey, it's a great way to be richer, it's a great way to be independent, generally are not as successful as the ones where people started because they believed in something. They wanted to do something important. It could be something really important like curing the injustices in the world or solving some disease or it could be something small. We want to make the internet faster or we want to, perhaps we want to democratize software or something like that. There's usually some passion and you need that because all business has obstacles and they all business is hard at times, often most of the time. And you need to have that passion to carry through. And so if you look at really successful companies and founders, they'll typically tell you that they really believed in what they were doing and they thought it was a good thing to do. So those things go hand to hand. Now let me give you some examples of this entrepreneur process I've used when I've used it and when I didn't use it. I was just talking to Tom Bires a few minutes ago so he'll relate to this. I'm going to start off with an episode of my past when I decided not to take the entrepreneurial route. This was back in 1987, I guess it was. I was at that time, I left industry in was a full-time graduate student at UC Berkeley in biophysics. I won't go into all that story there. But I was out of industry at that time and I'd fallen in love with the idea of building a mobile computing product that was shaped like a tablet. You know, had a flat screen, there's no keyboard, you had a stylus and you'd be able to interface with it and so on. And I had several options in front of me to produce this product. I really, this I felt was a good way of starting into this mobile computing arena, start with a set of this handheld device that people could use while walking around and so on. And I had a couple options to meet. One was to go back to my old employer. Previously going to Berkeley, I was employed by grid systems and they were interested in having me come back as an employee and I could build, I could take a team and build this product there. This was desirable in some ways because it was fairly, I knew them, there was a group of people there who knew me. The product I wanted to build was first targeted towards vertical markets at enterprise sales and that's what they did so that was a lot of things. There wasn't a lot of financial upside in this because I was an established company and I was coming back in sort of as an employee. Another option I had was to join a startup company, it had just been formed. This startup company was called Go Corporation and it was, some people laughing here because I don't get to know this story, but this is whole sorted history of pen computing and stylus computing and pdi and so on. The Go was a really exciting startup company. They had great venture backers, they had a great stellar team, Bill Campbell who spoke here earlier in the series he was involved with Go and so was Tom Byers who was a side company called Slate. Anyway, I wasn't going to be a founder of that company but I could join, I think it was going to be like the sixth employee or something like that. I had an offer to join them and they were building a very similar product. They were building an operating system and a tablet computer with a stylus interface. That from a fairly sort of financial return point of view looked much more promising than going back to grid. However, I felt that I'd be more successful at grid in following my goal and one of the reasons was is because Go is trying to build a consumer product and trying to replace Microsoft and build a whole new sort of genre. I thought that was too ambitious at that time. I felt that that time the best you could do is go into enterprise products. These things are going to be fairly expensive and fairly narrow in the reach. And if there was a choice between I think I'll be more successful in building the product going the grid route and perhaps more financially successful going the Go route. I chose to go the grid route. I chose not to do the entrepreneurial thing even joining an existing startup. And it was probably a good idea that I did that. Eventually, Grid built a reasonably successful business on the grid pad. It led to a lot of career advancement for me. And for whatever reason eventually Go did go out of business and struggled for many years. Then the next time here's the time I actually decided to use the entrepreneurial process, I was now at grid. It's five years later. And we're doing the grid pad thing. And I decided I want to do a consumer product. I want to do a little thing that's under $500 that people would be able to consume with channels as opposed to the enterprise channels. And I felt at grid I couldn't do this at grid because this was a consumer product and grid was an enterprise sales company, enterprise computing company. Making matters a little bit more complicated. Grid at this time was owned by Tandy Corporation. Tandy it, Tandy owns a radio shack and they own computer city and incredible universe. And they were the third largest PC manufacturer at that time. And so they were very excited about building this consumer product at Tandy. And they were putting a lot of pressure on me and making it hard for me to do something else. But I said to myself, look, a consumer product at an enterprise software company grid didn't make sense. And although Tandy was a large PC manufacturer, they really were a retailer. And a retailer shouldn't be building the products that go into their channel, especially if you're trying to build a broad product. So I tried to convince them that the best thing for me to do was start a new company to do this palm. And they didn't like this. I'll tell you a story. I went to Fort Worth to visit John Roach who was the CEO of Tandy. He's a nice guy. And Tandy, they own these two big towers, downtown Fort Worth, Texas. They dominate the skyline. There's 20 story towers. And John's office is the top floor of one of these towers. And it's very intimidating. You go there, there's a little waiting room on the fourth floor and what sits around shaking all day long. And then John says, you can come visit me now. You get off the elevator at the 19th floor and there's a receptionist. And this is a huge panel of glass. And then you get on this one way escalator. It says you step on the bottom, it takes you up. If you step on the top, it takes you down. And then you go past another receptionist and another receptionist and then says, long hallway. It's just like going to visit the Wizard of Oz. You know, at this point, you're going, you want to turn around. Not me, but this is, you know, I had a little bit of cocky attitude back then. Anyway, go down and visit John. And he's in his office down there. He's got this beautiful view. And he has this Texas draw. And he goes, you don't want to start a company. You know, those Venture Nat Capitalist, they're going to squash you like a nap. And he puts a stone on the table and he goes, you know, and but I said, John, I just don't think it's going to work here. I really, you know, I'd love to stay here. It's easier for me, but I don't think it's going to work because I don't want to write business mix. I needed, I can't be an enterprise computer company and I can't be captive to a retailer. If I could have done it, I would have. So that's the time I started Palm. And Palm was actually very hopeful because I had several Venture Capitalists who are trying to convince me so I was playing them off each other saying, I don't want to start a company. There's a lot of work, you know. And I said, John, I don't really want to do this here. And I meant both of those, actually, I wasn't being facetious or disingenuous. But in the end, I decided the best thing to do was to start Palm. And I said, I'd only do it if I have really great support. My VCs had to really chip in and help me out quite a bit, which worked out pretty well. Another time I, we did the entrepreneurial process was when I formed Hansbring. And this was, we are now at Palm and Palm was owned by three com at this time. So three com is a networking company. And three com's business wasn't doing very well. It was really tanking. But Palm is this little of wholly owned subsidiary or division of three com was doing really, really well. We were growing and very rapidly. And we were sort of shoring up the financials of three com. And they didn't break out our business. And we felt that this was not a good situation. There were several conflicts. One conflict was basically we want to invest in Palm in the growth of this new business. And they wanted to siphon off profits into other parts of three com. And then there were some legal issues like we were suing Microsoft and we won. But then they wanted to back away from it because Microsoft got pissed at three com. We said, look, Palm has to be independent. We went to the CEO of three com. He said, sometime now or in the future, we don't care. Let's figure out how to make it independent because it really doesn't belong here. And we went through a six to nine month process. We brought in investment bankers. We met with the board. We did this whole analysis. In the end, it came down to the CEO's decision. And the CEO said, you know what, I'm not going to do this. I'm never going to do it now. I'm never going to do it in the future. And it just belongs here. We felt that if Palm stayed part of three com, it would die. And that it wasn't worth sticking around watching it die. So we said, okay, we're going to have to leave then and we'll have to start another company which ultimately would compete with Palm. And people said to me, oh, congratulations. This is wonderful. I said, you're kidding. This is a terrible situation. We were totally bombed out. This was a huge setback for us. We did not want to start a new company. A financially, financially it looked like it would be a good idea because we'd end up a lot of equity in the new firm. But from our mission of building mobile computing and promoting and progressing the mobile computing world, this was a huge setback. And we were not happy about it. I was bummed out for weeks. So we decided to do it. But it wasn't like, you be, we're off the start of the company. It was like, oh, damn, I want to start over again. Because it's a lot of work and he sets you back and it takes time to start businesses. If you don't have to, why bother? It's just a slow process. Finally, I'll give you one more example in the hands-up computing world. Handspring, we started handspring, it was now an independent company. Guess what? Three comm decided a year later that they had to spin out Palm anyway. So now Palm is separate and three handspring is separate companies. And we were about to introduce the first, the trio 600, the product that looks like this guy. We were at handspring. And this turned out, the trio 600 turned out to be a very successful product. But it was going to be very expensive to bring it to market. And at that time, handspring didn't really have the cash to do it. We didn't have enough money to bring a very complex product like this to market. So we had two options. Always have two options. Never make a decision with one option. Always have two options. So we have two options. One, we had to raise independent financing for about $40 million. And we are a public trade-accompanied at this time. So this is a pipes financing, which is a private investment in public equity or something like that. But it was $40 million. And for that, we were giving up some portion of the company. The terms weren't great, but they're OK. The other option that was on the table for us was to merge with our old company, Palm, right? The one we have left. Palm and handspring to come together. Now, they had been proposing this for years. We kept turning them down. I said, I don't want to do that. At that time, Palm had all kinds of problems. And the management team was messed up. We said, we don't want to get involved with that. But they had cleaned up a lot of the financial issues. And they had a better management team at this time. But I was still against it. And I'm going to tell you that we were in a board meeting now at handspring. And on our board, a bunch of venture capitalists, including John Doerr, and John Doerr, he really said something very insightful. He said, he said, look, let's stop thinking about our options between a financing option and a merger. He says, think about the merger just as a financing option. I said, how is that, John? He goes, look, in both cases, you're giving up some part of the company and you're getting some assets in return. That's what happens when you sell equity in your company. And that's what's going to happen if we do the merger. It turns out that Palm had a lot of cash, but they didn't have a lot of good products. We had an up and coming product, but we didn't have a lot of cash. And as long as we got representation on the board, and long as we had good representation on the management team, thinking about as a financing option. So now I can compare these two very simply together and say, which was the better financing option? And which would be most likely to lead us to success of the product in the product mission, which was a 300 or 600? And we decided that merging with Palm was the right choice at that time. So that was a sort of not staying independent, becoming part of the old entity, not falling or entrepreneurial instincts, but saying, what's the best thing for the product? So those are my examples of two times I did it, two times I didn't do it on the computing side. Now let's talk about science. Okay. Throughout this whole time, I'm always working part time. Most people don't realize this, but I worked anywhere from one to two to three days a week on my neuroscience interest throughout all these years. And I've gotten to know quite a few neuroscientists. In some time around the beginning of the 2001 or something like this, I was talking to some neuroscientists about how can we make a change in neuroscience? How can we get more people working on the big questions of neuroscientists? How does the brain work from a theory? You think a lot of people would be working on this. It's not true. There's very few people who work on the big theory of brain function. They all work on little pieces. And we'll tell you why in a second. But how do you do that? One thing I could do is I could start a foundation and fund things. I would be pretty easy to do, but it wasn't going to be very effective. Because the foundation, you can get money to people and they'll say, oh yes, we're happy to get your money and we'll do whatever you think. And then they do whatever they want anyway. This is a well-known secret in academia. You know, take their money, give them a name over the door, and then do what you're going to do anyway. It wasn't going to make a difference. And so some of my neuroscience friends said to me, you know what, the only way you're going to make a difference is to form an institute that's focused on this particular problem. And I said, that's stupid. I mean, that's crazy. First of all, it's a lot of work. It's like starting a business. I said, who's going to be the first scientist to come to this institute? You know, you put a single entrepreneur, you want to be a brain scientist? And it's another problem too. Because in science and academia, you're going to get your whole career is basically trying to get on a tenure track. And if you get off of that tenure track, you're whole. So going to work at some little crazy new startup institute is a very, very risky thing to do. So I said to my friends, I said, look, I'll do this. If you tell me, you know, if you're going to help me do this. And so that's what we did. We basically said, okay, we'll start in a institute. And by the way, starting a scientific institute is exactly like starting a company. You have legal issues. You've got IP issues. You've got rent. You've got employee issues, HR problems. All the same stuff. You've got a board, board meetings, and financials, you know, everything's got to be done just like a business. And it's a lot of work and there's a lot of issues associated. So I didn't want to tread down that path lightly. Okay. So let me tell you a story. Let me just tell you a story about this, if you will. I'll come back this later. I'll come back this later. Come back. Okay. My next story is, why did I start New Menta, which is this new business? We just started a month ago. So let me tell you about R&I. R&I is about 10 scientists, some PIs, or like senior scientists, some postdocs, and student. And we're also working on the same problem. We're all trying to work on the theory of New York cortex, how the New York cortex works in the brain. Everyone signed up in some of the scientists they see in the room here today. And everyone that we're sort of working on the same problem. And to some extent, R&I was very, very successful. In my mind, it was extremely successful. By focusing on a particular problem, by bringing outside speakers in, who we would pick, we'd say we want to learn more about this and about this, we'd bring in, we would do intensive stuff. We really made a lot of progress. And the theory that's outlined in my book really came out of the sort of interactions that came out at R&I. So from this point of view, it was very, very successful. And R&I has a reasonably good reputation now in the neuroscience scientific community. I knew that when people started telling me, gee, when am I going to be invited to come to R&I? How come I haven't been invited yet? So and so has been invited. And so it really, it's turned out to be, it's three years old, it's turned out to be pretty well. However, I'm now at this, I'm stuck. I have a theory about New York cortex. I'm pretty certain it's right. And how it works and how we think. And I want to progress to the next step, the next step. And I'm kind of stuck at R&I now because I got a bunch of independent scientists. And although we've got this theory, they're still independent and they do their own thing. And then I'll all work on the same thing. And I really want to progress the theory that I've come up with and make it go forward. So when I decided that the best way of doing this is actually to start a business. And we sat around and talked about this because again, starting a business is a big commitment and time and money and effort and lots of problems. But I decided it was the best way to promote the science because I want to bring a commercial or financial incentive that people will work on it with me. And so that's what we did. And Numenta is building tools to take this theory and build and tell us at machines that these memory systems. If you want to learn a little bit more about it, you can go read the book or you can look at nemento.com. So that was, you know, I was at every point along the way in the neuroscience world, you know, what's the right process? What's the next step? And one point in time I said I'm going to do a nonprofit, the next time I'm doing a nonprofit, but also the furthering the goal. Okay, let me just give you some thoughts about the difference between entrepreneurism and science and entrepreneurism in industry. And I found this interesting so maybe you'll find it interesting too. In industry, entrepreneurism is a fairly well understood thing now. You know, if you went back, you know, 30 years ago or something, it wasn't. But today you have these entrepreneurial forums, they have entrepreneurial classes, it's so on. So if you wanted to start a business using the entrepreneurial process, there's a lot of help. You can find funding. There's VCs who are just designed for funding startups. There's lawyers who are experiencing this. There are employees who've been through the process and know what to expect. No one says what the hell is this about? They say okay, I know what this is about. In science, it's not like that at all. If you want to do something that hasn't been done before, there's like no help. There's no funding. There's no, you know, people don't know what they're doing. They're like what? What is this about, you know, and trying to solve the brain basically is really what you do. It's very radical and crazy and risky. I'll tell you a story here. Most of the neuroscience funding these days comes from the National Institute of Health, NIH. And through a board member, I got a very high level of introduction to NIH. I went out to Washington and I gave a talk to pretty much all the program managers who fund neuroscience or theoretical neuroscience in the federal government. And this is where the vast majority of the money comes from. And I made it very clear that I was there not to ask for money. I said, look, aren't I funding or not myself? But I was there because I wanted to learn about how they fund and what how I can help them and so on. So I got all these program managers in the room. I tell them what I want to do. I said, we want to come up with a theory of near cortex. Now, well, that's fantastic. That's the most important thing. We really, really need that. That's really great. You're going to do this. I say, well, how do you guys view this? Did you fund research like this? Oh, no, we don't fund anything like that. I said, why not? Oh, we can't. And this is their words. I'm not making this up. And I said, well, why not? If you think it's so important, you're just going to say, well, let me tell you how we fund things around here. First of all, it's all done by committee and consensus. So we bring in like 40 scientists from the outside. We bring them together. They serve on these committees. And they review the grants that come in for doing things. And we all have to agree. Everyone has to agree. It's consensus. So if there's anything kind of radical in there, or anything I haven't been done before, someone's going to beat all of it. And all these people all know that their grants are going to be reviewed in the same process. And the people that they're seeing next to are going to be critiquing them in the future. So this is their words. Basically, what happens is it's very, very difficult. And they're really impossible to fund something that hasn't already been done. And this is what goes on. I'm saying, oh, boy, this is hard. So there is no equivalent to the venture capital community. It'd be like going to bankers and saying, I'm starting a brand new business. And would you give me a loan? They'll say, no. But you go to venture capitalists and they figure out how to structure this to make it work. There is no equivalent in science. No one can do that. There's nobody help you set this up. There's no models for this and so on. It's very, very different. I'll tell you another little analogy I made here. In business, let's say you start a company and you're working on some new thing. You typically have just a few competitors. In any business, you really just have a few competitors. So you might just have, let's say, five competitors in whatever you're doing. And if you're a bunch of startup companies or small companies, maybe you all have 100 employees or several 100 employees. But you're surrounded by hundreds of people working on the same thing. You're on the same team. You come together every morning. You distance the competition. You convince yourselves you're going to be successful. Rar, rar, rar. And you've got a few five competitors. You can distance it. All those guys, we're going to kill them whatever. In science, it's just the opposite. The teams are very small. In science, there's typically five people to a team, a true company. It's a principal investigator, a scientist, a couple of postdocs, and a couple of students. So you have these very small teams. And there's hundreds of them. And they're all doing the same thing. So you've got hundreds of competitors with five people each. I find it very depressing. You want to surround yourself with people who at least think the same way or and telling you, oh, yeah, we're going to do it right. Pat, you know, on the back and so on. But in science, there's these little teams. And there's hundreds of them and they're all out competing with each other. And it's really kind of, it's just a very different dynamic. And it's very hard to break through that. And I've been trying to do that for several years now. OK, let me, those are some of my contrasts between science and industry here. Let me end up with my lessons here, the walkaway points. First of all, I think everyone should try to find something they're passionate about in their life. It doesn't have to be a big thing. It doesn't have to be, you know, it doesn't have to be like solve world hunger. It's OK if you want to do that. That's pretty good. But you ought to find something. You know, you pick it. It could be a business thing. You know, we want to build the better chip. We want to make the internet faster. We want to do this. We want to do that. It could be a science thing. It could be a public interest thing. I don't care. Find a passion. You don't have to get it right away. You can be patient about it. You can develop later in your life. But be on the lookout for it. Because that's what makes I think what makes an interesting life. As you find something in your passion about it, you say, OK, I'm going to work on that. And I'm going to work on it for a while. And it gives you some reason to go through all the crap that happens in life, especially if you pick a challenging thing. There'll be a lot of bad things happen. The harder the challenge, the more difficult is you encounter. But pick a passion and then follow it as long as you can. Along the way, lesson number two, use the fastest and surest ways to promote or get to your goal. This is gradually back to entrepreneurship. At any point in time say, what is the surest method of progressing my goal? Not still in that it's going to make me the most money, the most fame, whatever. I believe that rewards come from following your passion and having success at that. And all the other stuff you care about in life will take care of itself if you are true to your beliefs and you pick a good goal to go after. And so sometimes you take a step forward, times you take a step backwards. But if you continue following it, you want to always look for what is the surest way to get there. And that's how sometimes you say, it's not the entrepreneurial process. I should develop this product here at the company I'm at already because it would be quicker when we're sure to get done on time and so on. Remember, entrepreneurialism used it as a last resort. It is not the first tool, it's the last tool. So when you're up against the law and there's nothing else you can do and you say, well, the only thing I can do now is throw it all away and start over, then do it. If you try to do it, at other times you'll have a problem. If you only use it as a last resort, then it's usually a successful tool. And as I said, the more ambitious the goals you have, the more likely you'll have to use the entrepreneurial as a process. And in some cases, maybe multiple times is in my case. And then finally, works smartly. This is just a catch all for a bunch of little things I want to put in here and together. One is, I don't believe you have to work really hard like long hours to do a lot of significant things in your life. It doesn't require that. It requires making the right decisions at the right time, the critical decisions along the way. Should I do this, go this route or this switch, or I raise money or sell the company and sell it. And you make those decisions over and over again. Those are the critical junctures. And if you make those critical decisions right, then pretty much everything else flows along. If you're finding yourself having to work 20 hours a day, then you've got something wrong going on. For most of the time, my kids were young. I had this rule that I always have breakfast and dinner with them. I still have that rule except they're not there now. But because they're teenagers, and they're off doing their things all the time. But that was a rule I had. And I thought, you know, unless you're traveling, and I tried to travel that much, you can actually do that. And it'd be amazing that life continues if you don't at their office every day. Keep your eye on the goal. Don't let it get away from you. Don't forget why you started this thing or what you were trying to accomplish. Because everyone wants you to forget it all the time. There are all these contingencies that come along. And I'm always forcing you to do this and forcing you to do that to see, no, why am I trying to accomplish here? What is the ultimate goal? And it sounds easy, but it's actually pretty hard to do that. But if you really do that, it'll work. And then finally, try to have fun. I say try because it's really not possible to have fun all the time. You know, business, when you do anything challenging, it's always full of, it's day to day crisis. That's what businesses, it's crisis a day. And only at the end of the day, you actually get back and look at it and say, hey, that was pretty good. So you've got to try to have fun as you go through these crises moment to moment. I'll tell you a little story. There was a book written about Palm, called Pile Living Palm. I was written by one of our early employees. And it covers about a tenure period. And it's actually quite good. It's very accurate and it's fairly entertaining to read. And I can't remember things too well. And so this woman, Andrea Brutor, she wrote this book. And when it was done, I got a copy of it. And of course, she interviewed for it, but she interviewed a lot of people for it. And so it covers this formation of the Palm computing and all the things we went through. And I read this book and was like, really exciting for me. It was like, I couldn't remember any of the stuff. So it was like new to me, you know? And I'm like, oh, I'm just going to happen here and what's going to happen here. And it sounded really exciting for me. Actually, I don't know. Wow, look at it. And it really struck me because when you're going through it, it doesn't seem that way. When you're going through it, it says, you know, oh, problem after problem after problem after problem after solve this stuff. But when you look back at the end of the day, you say, hey, this seems like pretty cool. You know? All the problems were documented, but they just didn't seem so annoying in the book. Sorry. So anyway, the point is that you just got to have faith that in the end of the day, it's all going to turn out well. And therefore, don't sweat it too much. And every day when there's a new crisis, try to remind yourself saying, hey, you know what? We'll get through this. Just follow the goal, follow the mission, and you'll get there. OK, so that is the end of my prepared comments. And I'm told we're going to take Q and A here for a while. Is that OK? Did I take enough time? OK. So will I ask any questions? Anyone? Don't be bashful. You're bashful. You're going to applaud if you want. I'll be right. No, go ahead. Oh, we have little microphones. Like you're in a squad car or something. I'm just sitting in a hardware design outsourcing that you said has employed in different states. And so how did some of the decisions to design in house or in house or? And again, giving a product the way to offshore electronic to produce? Yeah. So you all heard the question I assume. So I don't have to repeat it in this venue. I find it pretty interesting this whole outsourcing thing, because there's a little big brew on how about it right now. But it started a long time ago. In the early 80s, all companies had the wrong manufacturing for computers. Grid had its own manufacturing plant right here and now view them in Fremont. And now no one would do that. And so the back then, that was the way we did it. And in some way, one day, the manufacturing came in. He said, you know what? I think we can do this cheaper and better and higher quality if we have someone else manufacturing really good at this stuff, and we're not very good at it. And so that's what we did. And so we outsourcing and manufacturing started happening in the early 80s. And now, of course, people were talking about outsourcing of support centers and software engineering and so on. I guess I'm pretty much of a globalist. I can't see the difference between outsourcing jobs to Georgia and outsourcing jobs to India. Basically, you have to have a fairly non-world view to see that one is better than the other. And if people in India need the jobs and they're poor, I don't see any reason why they shouldn't have it. And maybe I sounds unpatriotic or something like that, but I kind of look at the world globally and I say, gee, those people need this work. And so these people, but who might have decided who in the world should get a job, and shouldn't get a job? So this overall, our overarching philosophy in my part. Now, the decision-winning outsourcing, we don't sit around and go, should we outsource or not? No, it doesn't work like that. You say, hey, at this point in time, what's the best thing I can do? What's going to progress my goal the best? Where am I going to get the support? We sometimes bring things in and sometimes we push things out. We've gone both ways. We now outsource some of our design, but we've brought some of it back in. Some of the hardware engineering is out, some of it's back in. At any point in time, a good example, if a product is a fairly easy product at design, like you've done a bunch of them in race, we're doing a new PDA. It's fairly straightforward. We'll probably find a better solution someplace else in the world that has a pool of engineers that are really good at this. If we're doing something that's really unique and hasn't been done before, it's probably better to have it closer to home in our own labs, because we're going to be sitting there minute to minute figuring out what we've got wrong and trying to experiment and so on. So as a general rule, we tend to have inside or closer to home the things that are most challenging and interesting, not interesting, but challenging new. And as it becomes more of a commodity, then you can find more people and more places to do it and you can reduce your cost and so on. So that's the general philosophy. And I don't think it's going necessarily always going one way or the other way. I think the world is becoming global. And there are people really smart and really motivated all around the world, not just North America, not just Japan, not just wherever your favorite country is Finland. And so let's just don't fight that thing. Just go with it. It's not like some evil plan to, you know, deprive people of someplace of something. It's just what it is. It's the globalized world. And there's very little you can do about it. And I think it's a good thing, actually. I'm not embarrassed by it all. Mr. General, back here. I've never meant to tell you that things you know something about how the racing work. You claim that you've got some great theory. You've got a whole research into that. I've only done something. I certainly know a lot about foreign games or brain, so foreign materials or graphics. So I'm wondering how you view that interest three day to it to help you either in the house or away, and I'll take your point to look at some great secrets about how it works. So I'm not sure I understand the question there. It starts with, it starts with skepticism about it. I know something how the brain works. But then I'm not sure if you were asking how I influenced the how the crossover between my two jobs, is there something like that? Well, the first part is how the brain works. Oh well, that's it. That's a, that is an hour talk at a minimum. But I'll give you a flavor. Vistual, it's not just the brain. It's the neocortex in the thomas. So we're interested in very specific parts of the brain. And neocortex is the big sheet on top. And that is where all high level thought occurs. That's where language and visual perception and some epicenter touch and mathematics and language and planning and so on art. Everything you know, anything you can tell me comes out of your neocortex. There's a lot of other parts of the brain that I'm not studying. Second thing, the neocortex, just to give you a sense, even though it does all these different things, it actually works on a single principle. This is not something I made up. This is a well-known fact. Some people have refused to believe it because it seems hard to believe. But believe it or not, the way you see it's the same mechanism is the way you hear and the way you touch and the way you move and the way you think about mathematics. It's all the same mechanism. And you can, once you've accepted this and then you follow this idea, you understand, what you understand what that mechanism is, you can understand why it does different things and how it does different things. So it's not like solving lots of different problems. It's solving one big problem and it turns out the neocortex is so flexible that it actually turns out to be simpler than you think it might be. It's not designed specifically to do language, specifically to do mathematics, specifically to speak English or design computers or anything else. It's very, very generic and a human being from birth can learn a tremendous amount of different beliefs about the world and you can do a lot of different things. So it's not as hard a problem as you might think it is. It is counterintuitive how it works and just in the 10 second definition of this, it is a cortex, it's a memory system, it's hierarchical, the regions are connected in a hierarchy and this hierarchical memory system builds a model of the world and then through that model it makes predictions about the future. If you really want to, you know, if you want to get the rest, read the book, get it from a library, you can buy it back there. I'm not here to sell books, they want to sell a book. So I'll sign books after I talk to them and I'll once I get it. But, you know, and I understand your skepticism. So be skeptical. You know, that's what, you know, being entrepreneurism is all about. It's, you know, people don't believe they're gonna do something and then you go do it. So from where I'm sitting at this part of the stage from what I've been through, I'm pretty confident about what this is. From your position, you can be very skeptical. I understand that. And you know what, then I would be on a rainbow. How did that affect what you've done and from now on, is there a problem? How to affect what I've done? What do you mean? Do you solve the body that's the answer that I should have? How does it affect it? Well, my brain is me, right? Your brain is you. So my brain's starting a new company. I've not. I mean. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll put it this way. It tells you, it gives you a lot of insight. It's a psychological phenomena. You can explain how we learn, why we make mistakes, why we're prejudiced, how, and so on. It really explains an awful lot. And, but I'm just gonna leave it at that and I'll answer all the questions from other people. This gentleman right here. What do you think is singularity and what's the biggest, most important lesson on the next issue? What about the singularity? What's your opinion about it? What the singularity? I don't know. The physics, the physics, the physics, the energy is singularity. Maybe I don't know the singularity. Explain the, oh, the future doesn't need us. I know that one. Is that something about the singularity? Oh, I think I read about the singularity thing, probably forgot about it, dismissed it. The future doesn't need this. This is by Bill Joy. It was in Wired Magazine. I don't know, five years ago or something like that. And so Bill Joy wrote about, I think three things, something about intelligent machines and reproducing machines and something else. I can't remember. And basically he says, we're gonna destroy the world because we're gonna build these, this is a roughly paraphrase. So, excuse Bill Joy if you ever listen to this. Roughly paraphrase that, hey, we're gonna build these little machines, they're gonna take over the world because they're gonna replicate and they'll be smarter than Austin will be destroyed because we'll be, nothing. And did I get that right? Right, basically. Call us if he's nodding, okay. So, I don't believe any of this is gonna happen. And I'll tell you why. First of all, I do think it would be dangerous to create things that reproduce, okay? If you create little life forms that reproduce, that could be pretty dangerous. Those are like viruses and bugs and bacteria. That's pretty dangerous stuff. But building brains and understanding the brain work and building smart machines has nothing to do with that. It has nothing to do with actually building human-like things. It's building the near cortex, not a human. We're not building things that replicate or feel bad about, being in a little black box on a rack someplace. It's basically saying, understanding how the brain works, taking that knowledge, what can I do with it? And I write about this a lot in the book, about what these things will be like. And it's not threatening at all. When they invented the steam engine, people thought this was miraculous. Here was a machine that had the power of animation, the power of animus, which up to that point was a complete mystery. There was living things and there's dead things. Living things in rocks pretty much. And living things were magical. They had a laundry talent. And now some, here's a machine that moves. And this is like people said, this is the end of life because we've just created living things. Didn't turn out that way, did it? No one sits at the look at their vacuum cleaner and say, oh my god, it's got a motor in it. And the same thing happened with computers. When computers first came along, people said, whoa, thinking machines, they're going to, they're going to, the internet or whatever is going to like, enslave us and so on. It didn't turn out that way. The same thing's going to happen here. It's a technology. I happen to believe this technology, which I call hierarchical temporal memories, is a really, really significant technology. I think it's going to be one of the most important technologies in the next 50 years. And yet, I don't think any threat to it. I'll certainly something could do something bad with it, I suppose, but there's no threat to humanity. So when I read Bill Joyce's piece, I only for real for certain one of his components, when he was talking about brains, and I said he didn't understand it properly. He didn't understand what was going to happen. He was reacting the same way those people reacted to the steam engine many years ago. And I thought a lot about this. I cannot see the threat from building intelligent machines. Again, we're not going to be like it. We're not building, you know, step-ford wives or R2D2 or something like that. It's three feet below. It's not like that, not Android. Just in the back there. So if you have 500 years of responding to a direct response, you can't see on TV. So how do you do that? I miss part of the question. You have five engineers on your team. This is the science team. For any part of the team. Any team. You've got a bunch of people on your team. And how do you differentiate them? So you have a bunch of candidates. Oh, you have a bunch of candidates. How do you hire someone? Very much. Pretty much. Well, I think you should go to the, you know, what's the, it must be a class for that here someplace. Well, there's no magic of that. Like a new meta, all right? We're starting out in a meta. And we put together a hiring plan. By the way, process is very, very important in starting any new business, even at the beginning. I mean, you think it's the last thing you need to do, but you really need an employee manual. You need to think about your compensation structure. You need to think about everything. You need to plan things out. So very early on in a company, before you really hire anybody of significance, you need to put together a financial plan and a hiring plan, which is part of the financial plan. And you think through all these issues, and then you stick with it. And it's, it's really, just today, we were talking about this morning, we're talking about a potential candidate who might be great. But we didn't really have that position right now. It was gonna be later in the year. And so we decided like, even that person may be great. Don't go hire him just cause of that. Hire them when you need them. And so, you know, we stick to a plan, and then you just stand in an interviewing process. You know, you, you scout the world for the best people you can try to convince him this is the best opportunity. And, you know, we have a lot of, you know, when you, if you're doing something exciting, you get a lot of people interested. So it's not too hard to get a pool of people. But, but then you really have to hire to the plan. That's the best I can do. And you want, you want a mixture of people. You want some junior people who are gonna, you know, who haven't been, who brains haven't been destroyed yet by other people's thinking. And then you want some senior people who've been through the process before. So now how to build companies. I'll give you one more little lesson about companies, right? The best entrepreneurs, in my opinion, have, have both positive experience and negative experience. You want them to have lived through a positive time, growth time at a company. Because then they know what growth is like and how to manage growth and how to grow, and what kind of problems you have with growth. You also want them to have lived through bad times. Companies that were suffering or failing. And because you want them to realize they just, usually not a walk in a park. I mean, there's a lot of people who came out of early Apple, after Apple had gone for many years, a really great growth. And they never worked anywhere else. So they thought, all business is easy, you know? Well, you need to just have fun, you know, make some T-shirts, and then it's going to be great. And then they find out that that's not really what it's like. And most businesses, every business, hits the wall some time. And you really, you better be observant to how that comes from. So when I look for people, it's really great to have experience on both sides on the senior people. They're junior people, you just start them out and say you train them as you go. All right, just gentlemen right here. So just think that your technology is really fast-breaking. You mentioned, do you have any idea how long is the day for commercial revenue, the technology, the market, and the market? Yeah. And you can do the first of these, or the cost of your trading. Yeah. So the first thing is that the enterprise narrative is things that people that start, when you start online, you end up when you decide at your case that technology is, why would your people start? Would you envision it's not cool if they bring it back off, or would you never just think it's something that's always going on? Yeah, yeah. So there's two parts of this question. How long is this going to take? And the other one is, it's sort of like, how do you know when it's ready? Oh, when you back off. Oh, when you back off. So my business partner, Don DeVisco, he says, you can present the financial plan. You can present the timeframe, but just don't ask for them at the same time. Right? You can pick one of them. I'm going to tell you how big it's going to be, or I can tell you how long it's going to take, but don't ask for the same thing at once. There's some truth to that. I didn't come here to pitch Numenta. In fact, I wouldn't be here for that at all. We're sort of in quite a part in some sense. But you know, Dean asked that I could mention it, and she'd mentioned it, and there was some news about it recently. So I'm not here pitching anything. In fact, we probably won't really come completely open with what we're doing, and probably this spring and next year. So how long will it take? It's very difficult to tell. I'm an optimist. You have to be in these situations. I certainly wouldn't have started Numenta if I didn't feel that I knew exactly how to get to a success from where I was. Prior to that, I did it as a nonprofit. I did it as an experiment in the laboratory, you know, science. But I pulled the trigger Numenta only when I said, you know what? We proved this work. We built it. I'm positive I can make this work. At least it is positive. I'll ever be. And now's the time. Go forward. How long it will take is very difficult to know. We're going to create a set of tools that allow people to apply this technology to a lot of different problems. We'll apply to a few. But mostly we're trying to build a set of tools. We're going to try to build a set of community of people to work on it. So when we come out with this stuff sometime next year, it'll be partly like here's how it works and here's something we've done with it. There'll also be like here's how you can take it and modify it and make it better and work on it. And I think it's a long endeavor. I view it as sort of like the beginning of the computing era. The computing era began in the 1940s and 1950s. Back and then the people built the first computers were pretty excited about it. But they hadn't invented the disk drive in the operating system and the compiler is in all the stuff that we chips that we take for it today. There was decades of evolution. We're at that point now in this new technology. I think it's going to be a lot faster because we're starting a more advanced technological base. But it's going to take a while. But I would say if we haven't done something really significant in five years I'll be very disappointed. It could be as fast as 18 months. The second question about when do you know when the back off? Most companies go out of business. All companies go out of business because they run out of money. That's pretty much the bottom line. And I've very, very few companies didn't succeed because they went too slowly. The vast majority of companies didn't succeed because they went too fast. There's occasional situations where you have a small market window and you have to hit it and if you don't hit it, someone else beats you to it. But especially when you do something new and really interesting, it's the people who last. POM computing made the POM pilot. We succeeded because we didn't go out of business. Everyone else went out of business because they went too fast. We conserved our cash and we were able to survive to the next round to do the POM pilot. If we'd spent our money a little bit faster, we would have never done that product. We would have been out of business. So most companies fail on the, oh my god, we have to go full speed ahead. Grow, grow, grow. And by the way, venture companies want you to do that to a large extent. It's in their best interest managing portfolio. It's not necessarily your best interest managing a business. So that's a subtle point, but I can get back to if you want. So what we're doing at New Mente, for example, we're just going to go really slow. We're going to go slow. We're going to basically say, okay, we're going to have 12 or 13 employees in our first year. We're not going to grow beyond that until we're absolutely certain that we know exactly what we're going to do with them. And we're really clear that there's going to be an opportunity. And at that rate, we can go indefinitely. We can self-fund it indefinitely. Not that we want to do that. But the trick is just pace yourself. Very few companies go out of business because they're too slow. They almost all got to business because they grow too fast. And then once you've committed in the hiring of these people, you just can't take it back. Okay, question in all the way to the back. Good, gentlemen. I guess it was one of the factors of the workforce. While you were city practice, you know, certain factors that were doing, like, the rents, the community, that was not a lot of people telling us that we're a type of, like, a big, like, fall to the lower east. They didn't work. They worked at the same level. Yes. What, in your last year or four years, you've been essentially falling into it and what people are going to do. What do you guys learn from what those ideas did? Well, remember back in the days of early AI. I mean, I started, my career started in 1979. So I lived through a lot of that. Right? And in fact, you know, my first disappointment in the brain world is when I applied to MIT's AI lab. And they basically turned down my application because they said, we don't interested in studying brains. I said, we all want to build machines. I want to study brains first and then build machines as well. We don't need to do that stuff. You know, if I put a broad brush on AI and neural networks, and it's not really fair to do that, because they're very complicated subjects. If I put a broad brush on it, you would say, I felt back then that they would both fail. AI was going to fail because they felt the brain was a computer. And I said, brain's not a computer. It's obviously not a computer. It works in completely different principles. I didn't know what they were at the time, but it was not a computer. So programming it to do it is not going to work in my mind. And they just ignored biology completely. Neural networks start out as saying, okay, maybe it's not a computer. Let's figure out how neurons work together. Good idea. But then they went to very simple neural network models. They didn't look at the large-scale structure of the brain. They said, what happens when I hook up 50 neurons together in this way? And it's totally unbiological. A real brain has large-scale structure. It's got these columns, interoper cells, and these hierarchical arrangements. And then none of the model took advantage of that. So they started down the right path thing, hey, maybe it's something different than a computer. Let's understand neurons. But in the end, as far as I'm concerned, they almost all, and there's a few exceptions. Almost all of them basically just ignored biology in the end. And so I was pretty critical of those. And you read my book, I was pretty critical of them in the book, too. Basically, this is not the approach. It's going to work. And the only thing approach is going to work. We have to first understand how a brain works. And then we'll go from there. I'll take one more question. And I think this general right around the camera is up to you. I'll see you in a few times, I think. I have something on a brain question. I was curious if your goal is to understand brain through actually property one. So if you could one day, if this is a brain one, if you want to take a bullet, then it's not my problem. That's a seven or eleven. And we are a real learning machine. Is that something that is as if it's achievable? Is it something that makes it that goal? Is something that is a problem? Yeah, yeah. So this is a good topic to end on. So first of all, we're not building brains. We're building the Accord Texas. It's something that works though. So yes, it's absolutely possible to understand how far as I'm going to send this possible to any physical system works. Our ignorance is our ignorance. But in the end, we haven't seen anything. We can't understand it ultimately. And in terms of the brain itself, the very complex organ of many different parts, the new Accord Texas in the thumbs of the parts I'm most interested in, and I'm absolutely certain you can understand that. You can build machines that work on the same principles. They are not going to look like brains. You're not going to look like babies. You're not going to go with 7 or 11 by little baby. You're saying, you know, this is my mechanical baby. This is just an algorithm, and you can be implemented in software. That's what we're doing today. We actually have this working. So I'm telling you that it's solving problems today. We're doing visual perception. And you can build machines that work that way. They may not look at all like a human, right? It might be just a car that understands traffic and how to drive. It knows how cars move and it models its world of traffic. It could be a system that I wrote about in my book about, like, weather. It just looks at weather stations. And it models weather like you and I model visual scenes. It takes a while to explain all this. It can be done in a book, but not in a lecture like this. And so these things, and some of them will be trainable, some will be more. You know, some of them will be like, hey, maybe I want my car not to learn. I want my car to be just way Toyota-built, or GM-built, I don't want it to change. I don't want to start thinking on its own. But maybe there are other systems that clearly want them to learn from experience. And you wouldn't go to 7-11 to buy a brain. It's just like a technology. Like you don't go to 7-11 to buy a microprocessor. It doesn't, on its own, doesn't do much. But you can embed it in other products and do these just things with it. And that's what this is. It's just a technology. And it'll be embedded in other products that give these products a ability to model a world and know how the world works their world. They may not be the same as our world. Model their world and make predictions about their world and interact with that. And so I don't think there's anything unethical about it. It's not, it's just like I said with a steam engine in the computer, it wasn't unethical to build those things. These eye-argents, not. And I don't think it'll be unethical to build these brains. It is not the same as building people or humans or cloning humans or anything like that. They look pretty boring. There's this little computer running on a desk someplace doing something. All right, that's my full lot of time. I'm going to stick around, but if anyone's interested, I'll sign books after this. But also, we'd like to talk for a little while. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So on behalf of Basis and SDP, I'd like to thank Jeff for speaking. Thank you very much. What do I got here? Little trophy. Little trophy. All right. We'll have the book signing out.
