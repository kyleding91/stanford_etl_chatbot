 You are listening to the draper Fisher-Jurvinson entrepreneurial thought-leader seminar, brought to you weekly by Stanford Technology Ventures program at Stanford University School of Engineering. And today's guest for the first of the corner is Janice Roberts, who is managing director of the Mayfield Fund. She has been, how many years have you been there? Six and a half. Six and a half years at Mayfield. And before that, she was involved with starting the investment portfolio for three conventures. She was educated in the UK and has a degree in economics and finance. Without further ado, Janice Roberts. Thank you. So first of all, thanks very much for having me here this afternoon at the relative start of a new year. So I'm excited to have the opportunity to get to know you a little bit. I'll speak for a few minutes, maybe a few more than a few. And then I'd like to have the opportunity to get some questions from you, which I hope I can answer. But it's always good to get your thinking and I can take that back to my partners and beyond and it. It really is good to get to know what you're thinking about. Now one thing I will mention, Tina kindly mentioned on Mayfield Fellows program. And just to give you a sense of how important that is, I have a young son, he's 12 and he's at middle school. And he wasn't doing so well in his P class. He wasn't really paying attention. He's a bit of a cheeky guy. And so I emailed his P teacher and he emailed me back and he called me back. And I thought, well, this is great. This is very responsive from a teacher. Turns out his wife was a Mayfield fellow. And he called me, are you the Mayfield? I'm not a field in any way. Turns out his wife was a Mayfield fellow. She came from Stanford and she's working in technology now. I've got a great job. But it was a great connection. But of course, that's not a reason to be a Mayfield fellow, but it shows that you get around. So anyway, for any Mayfield Fellows here, welcome. And we're pleased to be associated with you. So when I was asked to do this, I thought, what can I talk about? So it is the new year. And so the obvious thing would be to talk about key trends for 2007 and beyond. So I'm going to talk about new trends. But I thought I'd articulate those trends in a slightly different way. So of course, I've used a title here that comes from a TV program. If you haven't seen it with Julia Luey-Dreyfus, and this is the new Christine. But I don't portray myself as one of the old BCs, but I sort of am. And it's really important for us to adapt to what is going on around us. And so for a long time now, the venture capital industry has been Sand Hill Road, a little bit beyond, but very much about here and in the valley. And there have been some fundamental changes in the last couple of years, and there will be more. And I wanted to give you a sense of how we're seeing the world in which we operate, and how we're adapting to some of those changes in order to build the next generation of great companies, which, of course, we hope you may start, you may join, you may participate in. So that's all I wanted to talk about. Of course, I have to talk a little bit about Mayfield, and that's why I'm here primarily. So we are a venture capital firm based a few minutes away in Sand Hill Road, with very strong ties here to the university. What has changed in Mayfield? When I joined Mayfield six and a half years ago, I was a little concerned about coming from an international company to what I consider to be a somewhat parochial industry. And one of the reasons I joined Mayfield was that it was a diverse firm. It had a partner called Delaal and a partner called Farm, and I thought that was very interesting. And in fact, in all my international travels, a partner from Mayfield was the only one I'd ever seen on an international flight. So this encouraged me, and it also encouraged me that the outlook that the firm had. Well, we're not alone today. We're looking at investments from here to Beijing to Bangalore, and in fact, in the last few months, we've made investments in those places. And when I talk about the trends, I'd like to come back to some of the things we're actually doing within Mayfield, but more importantly, what we're trying to do is an industry. We have 12 investing professionals who operate in a bunch of different sectors from communications and networking to software, and increasingly in consumer and internet fields, digital media, and so on. We've been around for a long time, one of the older VCs, we've been around since 1969. And what I'm going to talk to you today is really important because we are adapting. We have to adapt. We have to embrace change, and I'd like to articulate that. Today we have a number of portfolio companies that we hope you know of, and we've certainly been successful in recent months having a number of interesting exits we sold companies to Cisco, to Juniper, to Google. And obviously, that's a very interesting trail for us. We're looking towards getting an IPO or two this year, and of course, everybody's looking for that. They're fewer and far between these days, unfortunately. But we've been investing in a broad spectrum from communications, mobile devices, mobile applications through to consumer and internet. And this is really important for us to understand as we go forward. The trend has been not necessarily away from traditional markets like telecom and enterprise towards consumer, but certainly there's a much stronger balance in terms of looking at more consumer-orientated applications as we go forward. So hopefully, some of these names that you see here, they will become household names. Certainly, one thing I will point out that we're very active still in Adventure Capital World. We made 17 investments last year, of which a handful were in China. And so in the internet space and the gaming space and the online betting space that you perhaps wouldn't do here in travel, really emulating some of the markets that have been big markets here and our local markets in China. We've also made a couple of investments in India as well, one in optical networking, and one in a seed fund, which is starting a whole bunch of new, exciting opportunities there. Just to recap on myself, so you know me a little more, I've mentioned I've been at Mayfield for a few years now, immediately prior to Mayfield, I was at 3Com, and at 3Com I really did a lot of different things. I'd come to 3Com through selling my own networking company to the firm. I ran a bunch of businesses, I also led marketing and business development, I acquired about 32 businesses, including 3 Mayfield companies, and I also acquired Palm. And so Palm reported to me, and after Donner-Dominsky left and form handspring, I ran Palm for a while, and I struck to the IPO before I left and came to Mayfield. So that was a very exciting time and got me back into the wireless world, and so you'll see that it may field a number of my investments have been in that sector, which has been, in fact, very exciting. I come from the UK, I think you can perhaps tell, many people here think I come from Australia or New Zealand, and I do have family there, so I may be picking up a little bit of that accent. But I was born and raised in a very rural part of the UK, in fact, and coming to Silicon Valley is almost as far as you can get from where I was raised. But certainly, the interesting thing now is when I go back home and I still keep a house in the countryside and the Cotswolds area of the UK, I have faster broadband, and Wi-Fi is everywhere. And there are sheep and cows, and a couple of farms around, and I can still pick up a couple of Wi-Fi networks, which I find extraordinary. So I have a couple of children, and they're age 10 and 12, and they're certainly early adopters of technology. You should see their bedrooms, and I look to them often for advice, particularly when it comes to mobile devices and gaming. So let's talk about some of these trends that we see. So you've all heard about the new move towards this global world. And I've seen that you've had a couple of presentations, people like John Doer, who've touched on that. So I won't copy what they've said, but I would just like to iterate to you how this is changing, because we are looking more and more at companies who will have global plays. So a few years ago, we started to think about the world, not just in terms of markets for our companies, but also in terms of leveraging talent for outsourcing. Now we're looking at investing in those countries and building companies. So at Mayfield, we now have Mayfield, China. We've just announced this. We started to invest in China alongside another fund two years ago. And after spending some time in Beijing last year, we decided that we would embrace that fund, and it would become Mayfield, China. So we are now investing in companies that are participating in the Chinese local market, and also in companies such as semiconductors and components that are looking to exploit the global opportunity from China. So this is very exciting for us. In order to be global, you have to be local, so we have a local team in place there. So we're not trying to manage those companies from here, but we are trying to learn what is important there. So we are spending time trying to understand those new opportunities and how we can also support the companies that we've invested in. So once again, you've got a country that is emerging and growing fast and is looking to leverage what's been done in the US, but also adapting those things to its own market. And what is interesting, one of the companies we've invested in in China is a dating site. So there's lots of online dating here, but in China, it's also difficult for Chinese people to have somewhere to meet. So our online dating has an offline component. So we have blinges and places where people can actually meet the people they've met online offline. So you have to adapt some of those businesses for the local markets. And I thought that was particularly interesting. And they're very nice rooms, by the way. It's all about having tea and coffee, and that's about it. But it was fun to see. So we're also looking to India, very carefully. And if you look at the Indian market, there is just a huge middle class there, and there is an abundance of talent. And there may be many of you here who come from India. What is interesting is that we're seeing more entrepreneurs going back to India to build businesses there. And there is a very strong communications infrastructure there that's being built. And the talent that's building that is taking those products and taking them to other markets. So I mentioned we've just invested in an optical networking company. Two of our partners are in India right now, and they're looking to assess how we might address the India market. So we think for us it would be very difficult to spend too much time developing early stage companies like we do here, but we'd like to get involved later and take it from there. But very interesting. And the other thing when you look at these countries is that you're not necessarily investing in technology. You might be investing in a shoe manufacturer, or the next Starbucks, or the next Hertz. And so it's very exciting looking at these types of businesses and how we can build great global companies. So a few years ago VCs were very focused on this area, maybe Seattle, maybe LA, maybe Boston. And now they really are looking to the world. What is fascinating to me is that, and you might think I'm exaggerating, but not by much actually, and you were traveling there recently, if you wanted to get to see a VC, you used to go to Bucks. Now the place to go is the Grand Hyatt and Beijing. And I got off the flight to November from here to Beijing. And I immediately bumped into one of our ex-CEOs. There was another VC on the flight, he was a sleep hatcher, trying to wake him up. But it's just amazing, the energy and the excitement about this market. Of course we have to be careful. It's easier to put money into a country, or into a company, let me tell you, and to get it out. So we're being measured in our approach, but we as the venture capital industry are very, very proactive. And what Mayfield is doing is not unique, and certainly in some cases venture capital firms are further along than us in China. And so we're all trying to evaluate our opportunities, and it's exciting. So another thing that's changed is that we have to get to know the new consumer. It wasn't so long ago that we invested in a technology. And the consumers who use that technology tended to be earlier doctors. They were perhaps other VCs like me, perhaps you. Now we're seeing technology is really going mainstream. And the other big change is that consumers want technology, but they also want to influence it. So we're not packaging up a technology, putting it on the shelf of Best Buy, and waiting for someone to take it and play with it. We really are interacting with consumers in very different ways. The demographic is changing enormously. I'm sure now your parents are taking to technology in a way you wouldn't have imagined a few years ago. You know, in my family we're sharing photographs. With most of my family I text message on a regular basis. My father has a laptop, and he complained to me recently that there wasn't a Wi-Fi network in the local pub. That's a big deal. Trust me, when technology takes on that level of ubiquity and pervasiveness in society. So we're very excited about that. And it really pervades many of the companies that we're looking at. So the interesting thing is that consumers broadly now, not just like you or me, want to be connected always. So we're looking to take more content to the mobile phone. They're interested in having information where and when they want it. So obviously we've seen time shifting in the TV world. And now we're seeing a much more diverse set of programming being developed from New York and Hollywood and beyond. So people are going to have their own Alachart menu of programs. It's going to be very interesting how this changes, how people want programs, the type of programs are going to be developed, how they're going to be taken to TV, to the PC, and to the mobile phone. And these are all places that we're looking to play in. The other interesting thing is that consumers have higher and higher expectations for technology. They're impatient, they're interactive, they care. So an example is search. A few years ago people looked to search on Google and they were delighted because they had a way of finding out information, getting to information that they needed. Now they don't want to get to the site, they want the answer. So people are getting more impatient with search. They want information that is contextually appropriate. They don't want to wait and they don't want to continue to surf. They want the answers. So this is changing the world of search. Google obviously is continuing to develop their offering, but other companies are coming in with the next search. And so all this is very exciting to us as venture capitalist because we're seeing new opportunities. We're seeing people are changing the way they live in their homes. Now obviously when you live here you get a different perspective of technology in homes. People have media rooms and all sorts of wonderful things. But certainly with the pervasiveness of broadband, with voice over IP, with wireless, mobile, Wi-Fi, we're seeing that people are expecting content to be delivered to their home in different ways, real time, their choice, not somebody else's choice. And this is going to lead us to more and more options as we go forward in terms of developing new companies and delivering those services to consumers. The real changes, consumers are embracing technologies and they care. We're also seeing new types of entertainment. So not wanting to over plug our companies, I'm an investor in a casual gaming company called Play First. And this is targeted at women and families and it's doing very well because more and more women are looking to their laptop on the dining table or in the kitchen to play games when and where they want to. It's the great way to occupy their mind to release their stress. They're looking to play those games on mobile phones. And as you know, people are looking to build homes and villages and cities and all sorts of things using the computers and getting their sort of stress release from the virtual worlds around them. So this is again very exciting for us. The consumer is really participating in technology in a way they never have before. And the consumer is the mainstream consumer. It's not just the early adopter. And then of course you take these technologies to other overseas markets and you're seeing that consumer is a leapfrogging. If you go to other countries you see much more advanced use of point of sale technologies than you do here in the US. You see much more advanced mobile use of mobile applications. So in parts of Europe and I'm sure some of you come from there and you've heard this before, people are paying with mobile phones. People are searching with mobile phones. People do this naturally and automatically without really thinking about it. And the age range is getting younger and the age range is getting older. And so again many, many new opportunities for us to address. But we have to understand that consumer. They will not put up with the complicated costly slow technologies that we have delivered to them in the past. So we have to step up. We have to understand their needs and we have to deliver to those needs. So these are really interesting things that we're having to assess as we go forward. The days of developing something and delivering it to the consumer. And it doesn't meet their needs are over. They will reject it. And they won't just reject it silently. They'll reject it over every website possible. And so this is a really important issue for us to understand. That we deliver subpar goods and services, the world knows about it. And I'll come back to that. Getting younger every day, of course, we all try to do this. And we all, particularly at this time of the year, right? I was commenting today to someone. You go out to lunch just after the new year. Everybody's eating salads. Everybody's running in the mornings. And we're all trying to get fit and young and all that. But the real point here is that the people that we interact with. People in some of the newer and faster growing markets are much younger than we'd ever dealt with before. So we sort of joke amongst ourselves. If you want to raise money, drop out, wear jeans, a sweatshirt, wear a hat, come into the way your trainers come in, look cool, bring a skateboard. It's much, you stand in a much bigger chance of getting money. And then we're all coming in and a suit with a briefcase. But the point here is that younger people are really looking to leverage technology in very exciting ways. And obviously we've known about some of the big ones in recent years in terms of building communities, in terms of self-promotion, which is something else we have to understand with my space, with Facebook. The world has completely changed. And so we have to understand not just you, but people much younger than you. We're looking to embrace technology, to use technology, to interact with technology in order for us to invest in the right companies going forward. And these are really attractive markets for us. In the last 10 years you've seen an enormous market emerge with gaming, gaming on all sorts of consoles, TV, mobile phones. And we have participated in this somewhat, but more and more people are building bigger and bigger games. And so this is a very exciting, very substantial, serious market that wasn't there not so long ago. We've all heard about music and mobile applications. But the point is, in many of these new opportunities, the people that influence this are the youth of today. And certainly not people who are 50 plus who are thinking about it, but younger people. And they're starting those businesses, they're leading those businesses, great entrepreneurial spirit and enthusiasm. And if any of you have any ideas in this space we'd love to talk to you, because it's really important that we understand what you're thinking about, and that we really support some of you in building some of these new opportunities. Losing control, nobody likes to lose control. But what's happening here? So the traditional way to bring a product to market was you develop it, you package it, you position it, you have a marketing plan, you launch it in one place and you launch it in another. I remember the early days of my marketing career, we'd have a marketing tour. We wouldn't just go from country to country in the space of a month, we'd go from city to city. You could manage that, you could control it, you could control your message. Everything's changed. Now much of this is good. So today, much of what we look towards in terms of marketing is viral marketing. I mean obviously we look to the web as a means of communication, a means of search. We look at user generated content, we look at blogs, we look at real-time feedback, we look at self-promotion. All these are new trends that affect the way we interact with customers, with consumers, affects the way we take products to market. So obviously time reinforces with their time man of the year, which is all of us. They've recognized how the world has changed, how we're all creating and participating in a way we hadn't done before. And we've invested in a couple of companies that are leveraging this. So we've invested in a company where people are posting sort of helpful hints, how to use certain products and technologies, not waiting for the manufacturer. But often shortcuts, service problems are solved, not by the company that manufactured the product, but by the people who are using the product. And so those useful hints are being posted now onto the web and we're looking at a way to aggregate that, I'm sure others are as well. But it's a very interesting idea that certainly wasn't there a while back. And so there's more and more of this type of thing going on. And certainly, we've seen companies that have had huge viral growth with minimal marketing. It's all word of mouth, it's all web-based. If you see a great idea, you tell six people, ten people about it, and so it goes from there. And this is new, and this is interesting. But there's something we have to think about one, in terms of launching new products, and two, in terms of new opportunities for us, as we develop new companies. But it's a very interesting change. You may well have grown up with it, but for some of us, it's a whole new approach that we have to learn and to understand and to leverage. So business models, they really are quite crazy out there today. So nobody wants to pay for anything. So I talk about the economics of free quite a lot. And most, I would say, of the consumer-orientated deals that we see that come in to our company, the businesses free. We're going to give this to people for free, particularly every web-based business is free. And of course, the solution to making money is advertising, advertising, advertising, advertising. Every business model is advertising. So that's sort of good. In that brands are looking to advertise everywhere they can, particularly with the whole time-shifting scenario of the TV, advertisers are looking to more places to advertise, whether it's, you know, on display boards, obviously online everywhere, on mobile phones, and so on. So it's interesting, but it's hard sometimes to bring together the world of advertising and the online world. Obviously Google has done it very well, but sometimes there's a mismatch in terms of ad inventory and placement. Advertises want to place ads next to the brand. They want to make sure their brand is promoting the appropriate way issues of adjacency and so on. But this whole economics of free is very interesting. I mentioned I'm involved in a game company right now we charge, but we're having to think through. We have to be free. And I think again it comes back to young people. People just don't want to pay. So the question for us as we look into new markets like mobile advertising is how much interruption would a consumer take in order for a service to be free. But certainly for sure, I think net of Skype and Boype and all that in the wireless world we're moving towards free rate plans. You're seeing companies already in Europe, MV&Os starting up that are offering free services. In order to get that free service you'll have to get a banner ad or two or three or four on your phone. But certainly the idea is that that advertising plan will be connected to some course of action so you'll be able to discover what you're looking for. But the net of it is this whole movement to free is a big change in our industry and we have to understand it. So selling a product, deducting the costs, looking at the gross margin doesn't happen as often as it used to. So also we're valuing nothing. What is the value of nothing? Nothing at all. So the key point here is that in many of the business plans we see the initial product is free. So take gaming for an example. So the initial game is free but customers, consumers will pay for digital goods. So if you have a character in a game you might be prepared to train that character and pay for it. You might be prepared to dress that character in a certain way. You might be prepared to pay to upgrade that person's home or whatever or car if you're in a racing game. And so that's just one example but we're seeing more and more opportunities now where people are willing to pay for nothing. So they're trading nothing. And so how we value nothing is very interesting. And so again you look to some of the auction techniques or whatever. But to me it's very fascinating what people will pay for today. So a real service, they want for free, nothing they want to pay for. And so I'm exaggerating to make a point. These are some of the things that we're thinking about as we're going into 2007 and looking at new businesses. And you'll see here I put beyond boxes because the whole old way of packaging things in boxes and charging for those boxes is gone. And in many instance when you look even at the more traditional markets where you're providing functionality in a box might be a service to a home or a service to a company. The days of those boxes are going away. It's about software and that software might be delivered as a service. So things are changing. So how you charge for things, how you provide that service, how you service that service is really changing and we have to understand that and address it. The other interesting thing for me in the valley is how we're going Hollywood. What was interesting to me when I came to California for a small and like most Brits when I thought about California I thought about LA. I mean that's how you perceive California if you don't live here. But of course I come to San Francisco and there's a huge divide between San Francisco and LA. Here in San Francisco in Silicon Valley with technology centric, intellectual, smart, you know, all those things that people in LA are not these media guys, crazy people, granola, you know all that sort of stuff. And you know, there really was a big gap and I don't think people traveled there very much. What is interesting now is that we're up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down all the time. Another way to meet the VC is to get on one or other of the LA or into county flights backwards and forwards because we're really seeing the convergence of technology and entertainment in a way that hasn't been seen ever before. And Apple of course is a great example of that and how that's really changed fundamentally the business. Apple computing to Apple, the big entertainment company. But we're seeing it more and more. So we're all looking at opportunities to bring different types of media and entertainment to consumers on any device, on the TV, on the PC, on the phone. And of course you've recently seen the announcement of the iPhone, which is going to be very interesting in terms of music and games and all those things. And so that's really important for us. And obviously we've all been working through for some time now the issue of how we pay for those downloads and the complexities of that. So we're also looking to influence what is produced in Hollywood so that the programs, the entertainment is more suited for the types of devices that the entertainment is being transmitted on. So there's a lot of dialogue, a lot of coming together and a lot of convergence. So there's some very interesting activity going on now. I think in the next couple of years you'll see TV change totally. I think there'll be a whole new different way of programming with different types of programs delivered in different ways. I think we'll see more and more and more entertainment coming to you on mobile devices. I think you'll see much more interaction with programs already we've seen companies we haven't invested in them where you can participate in sports. So you've already seen with your mobile phone you can participate in American Idol voting and these types of things. But this is really, the company is now where you can actually predict a play in a football game. And I won't go into any more detail than that because I don't understand American football. I do understand soccer. I'm very pleased that David Beckham is coming to LA. But I think net of that we are seeing more and more ways to interact. And actually I have to say in other parts of the world, particularly in my country in the UK, Sky TV has been very pioneering and looking at ways to be more interactive and deliver what the consumer wants. And we're somewhat followers here but we're seeing a lot of activity there. So you'll see more and more and more and more interaction between LA and of course New York and here and more and more convergence of technology and entertainment which is obviously an interesting opportunity for us all. Another trend, thank you Al Gore. And so we are seriously greener and so some firms are looking at clean tech as a whole new sector. As you know, Adventure Capital traditionally we've been in technology, biotech, health care and now clean tech. It may feel so far we've been very focused on technology. In the past we have invested in health care we're not now but we are starting to look at clean tech. Others are far more advanced than us. And so people do really care about their environment these days. They're not, you know, it's not lip service. Certainly we have looked at alternative energy and others are putting many dollars to work in the sector. Also looking at this whole concept of life quality and wellness and so on. And for some time there's been a lot of not for profit and now we're seeing for profit initiatives and some interesting companies being developed. And we'll start to see some IPO's coming out now in this space and that will generate more companies. Certainly one of my friends a few years ago had a technology company, software company and decided to go into the whole solar world. And we all thought, whoa, and he had an IPO last year and he's doing very well nicely. Thank you. And it's just, it's great, it's interesting, it's appropriate. And we will be spending more time considering this. And certainly when we go into other geographies, you know, it really is an important aspect of other governments thinking. And so we have to think about it. And so I'm sure some of you are thinking about opportunities in this space and I would encourage you to do that. And I would encourage you to think about how you can be good, be green and be profitable. But certainly talk to VCs about funding those types of opportunity. Beyond technology, I just want to spend a couple of minutes on this because certainly VCs are known for pursuing technology companies. And we do. And most of our companies certainly here we're looking for some form of technology differentiator. But as we move into China and India, we're looking at non-technology businesses as well. So I mentioned before we're looking at manufacturing. It might be castings for the automotive industry. It might be shoes. It might be the next chain of coffee shops. So we're really looking to develop businesses in those countries and also to recruit the right expertise locally so that we can add some value. But this is a big change for us where we've traditionally been a technology centric group of people. But also here in the US, many of the traditional markets that we have served quite frankly are somewhat saturated. They're somewhat saturated because the technology is mature. Enterprise software might be one area there. But also saturated in that there are lots of dollars out here looking for those opportunities. So those deals become quite competitive, quite highly priced. And of course not too many of them will be successful. So we continue to look at new markets and I've addressed a whole bunch of initiatives. But also in certain geographies we will look beyond tech and that's new. So in terms of how we're seeing investing, I did just want to make this point because many of you are looking at businesses and how you get funded. And so as venture capitalists we look at risk reward. And what is increasingly happening, and I'm talking the Royal Weenew in terms of the venture capital industry, not necessarily Mayfield. We're very interested in deals we can get in early, get a reasonable ownership, add value to the company and get a fair price deal. We're also interested in those deals where obviously relatively more risky because you're early, you don't know how a company is going to be developed, you don't know how the market is going to grow. We're also interested in investing late. So where there is more traction in the company, there are sales, there are customers, higher priced, less risk because you know the product or the solution works. In the middle, difficult. You know it's difficult today to get some of these B deals financed which was traditionally quite a sweet spot for investors because we're concerned particularly when you're looking at a consumer orientated deal. If you don't know what a consumer is going to like and with a consumer product you get it out there until a consumer says yes or no you don't really know how well it's going to go. And it's difficult to tweak a consumer product unlike software for example. So it's risky. So you're going early and get the ownership but in a middle stage deal where you need more money but you haven't yet proved the concept is much harder to invest in today. So if you're involved in companies like that I would encourage you if you can't get sales milestones to get some milestones to prove somehow the concept that you have developed or when you get money in early get enough money to take you to an appropriate milestone because that middle ground is really tough and getting tougher. So some things have changed and some things remain the same. So I thought I'd end by talking about what hasn't changed. We continue to look for big markets, great teams, differentiated technology. Cash is still king. I wanted to put queen but people tell me that's sexist. But certainly cash is the most important thing and if you're an entrepreneur you need to use it wisely because no cash, no company. Increasingly we're learning to live with the rules and regulations that have been imposed upon us so our veins oxy and all those different countries that we're dealing with now. And you know it's still a challenge in certain instances it's actually helped us to adopt best practices. I've just been working on a committee with a group of venture capitalists who've been looking to improve venture capital led boards. So as an entrepreneur if you talk to other entrepreneurs you'll hear some horror stories about boards and how venture capitalists behave or not. And so we're looking to adopt best practices and also to adopt some of the good things that Sybane's oxy has led us to consider. So we are taking it seriously at the same time we obviously don't want to have rules and regulations stop us from being fast and entrepreneurial and passionate. So we're living with it. I still believe today and I can be unbiased. I don't come from here. Silicon Valley has the best ecosystem for entrepreneurs in the world. So one of my other VCs said that Silicon Valley is not a place now it's a state of mind. Well we're looking to take that state of mind and leverage it in China and India and other parts of the US. But in terms of getting a company off the ground in terms of talent ecosystem money lawyers and so on is still the best place here. And we continue to be passionate about building new exciting industry defining companies. Now it's anywhere. And so I'd like to conclude with letting you know that older VCs are actually getting younger by the minute. We are adapting. We're embracing and we're very excited about all these challenges that we see. And all of these opportunities that for new and exciting companies and we're looking to hang out more with people like you. So thank you. Questions. Yep. So I'm moving more and more away from the last nonprofit to more and more full-profit ventures. So curious. So you had any thoughts behind the what are the sort of characteristics of industry that all of a sudden become more effective with full-profit development? Another one of the things that you think might be behind the trend that now more and more entrepreneurs from a full-profit point of view at technology for the most of 15 to 25 years ago. Yeah. So I was asked a question about clean tech and for-profit opportunities as opposed to not for profit. So not for profit will continue. But the big difference now is that people are taking clean tech seriously because they can actually see and feel environmental changes. And I have to say I think Al Gore has done a great job in promoting and getting people to be seriously concerned. At the same time, there are many people and many companies who are looking to develop products that will make our world greener if you like and people are willing to pay for it. So the big change is that people are willing to pay now. And so I think some of the bigger opportunities are for example in alternative energy. Some areas of alternative energy take so much money that it probably wouldn't be an entrepreneurial early stage venture capitalists that funded. But there are some interesting deals that we've in fact invested in one of ourselves. But it's really those opportunities that have markets. And I think the big change now without getting too specific is if you look at clean tech, there are markets now. There are products that people will pay for because consumers are demanding greener products. They will pay for greener products. I think about this every Tuesday night when I do my recycling. When I first came to California I thought it was most stupid waste of time ever. And now I'm you know separating everything that I can. And you know people look at cars. You know these the big shots in Hollywood are driving electric vehicles right. So if you think about it, consumer demand has changed. The behavior has shifted and creating markets. Yes. You talk a lot about the economics of free. Yeah. So the question was about the economics of free and if someone comes to us with a business model that's advertising base, what's the council? Well in many instances actually advertising works. I do think that you have to be careful and you have to think through how you're going to bring advertising. Say for example to your site. So not everybody is thought it through. So often it is the case that people will come to us and they'll talk about the business that looks interesting. And then we say how are you going to make money and they say advertising and they haven't really thought it through. And then they'll quote CPM CPC and so you know so many metrics your head's going to drop off just. But you have to think beyond the metrics. You have to think about how you're really going to attract advertisers to your site. You have to think about what is going to appeal to those advertisers. You have to talk to other companies who are going to really place those ads on your site. So I would say the key thing in terms of council is to think through the model not just come and say, oh this is the this is the site. This is what we're going to do. It's advertising base. We actually love advertising based businesses who wouldn't love Google. But you know you need to think it's true. Yes. Actually, I hear that obviously there's a lot of open India in China. But there's also a lot of opportunities and more developed markets such as Europe or America. And everybody talking about Europe. What kind of trends do you see going on there? It's opportunities. We're not preventing your capital firms based in the United States. I like this question actually. So I just asked about opportunities in Europe and that's where I come from. And I talk more about India and China because it's sort of where we as a VC world are putting significant dollars these days. And it's a relative change in activity. So Europe is not one place of course. I mean there's UK, France, Germany, Spain and so on. There are some common characteristics not a lot but there are some. But certainly in certain areas we are seeing a huge amount of entrepreneurial activity and we do look to Europe and we have one or two investments ourselves. So in the whole mobile space you probably heard this before but the markets ahead in terms of people building applications and using them in Europe. In terms of some of the TV applications that we're seeing Europe is ahead. We certainly seeing pockets of very interesting software engineers in Europe. What I would say has changed Europe a lot in the last couple of years is Skype. And we're also seeing new companies like a Wi-Fi sharing company called Von that comes from Spain. It's getting a lot of airplay right now in that airplay being interesting and that it's looking to build Wi-Fi access points everywhere that you share. And in Europe the sharing piece is actually more in line with cultures than here. So if you're in Germany you're very happy to share your Wi-Fi network with another German person. Or in the UK you'd be pretty happy to share. We're not into sharing as much to share your Wi-Fi network with somebody else. In Spain you'd be very happy to share your Wi-Fi network with someone else in Spain. So they're really leveraging that but coming here to the US as well. So that's interesting. So these high profile companies in particular Skype because of the interesting exit has really helping get that excitement back. So there is a really interesting entrepreneurial community. There is money there but it doesn't quite click like here. So London's not bad. Berlin is getting interesting. Great software community. I would say Madrid is getting better. So there are pockets. But if you talk to anybody in Europe, any entrepreneur or any VC, it's harder to put it all together somehow. And there is less of an orientation to risk. So these are the things we've struggled for a while. But we do look to Europe particularly in those sectors of technology where Europe is ahead. And also you're seeing on the software side in Russia in countries like that. It's some interesting talent coming forward and developing games and things like that that we're looking to leverage as well. One more question. Are the boss here said one more question. Do you mention that often? These are the people who want to meet me to a company and see India trying to put them. The doors of countries are going to end up soon with the moment. Right. Do you think that downstream happens for whatever reason? That extracting capital may be a problem at the moment? Yes. The question was, we talked about as an venture capital industry, we're putting money into China and India. And those countries are on and up at the moment. What happens if there's a down swing? How do you get money out? Of course, when you're investing in another country. And countries that have had interesting histories in the past with governments and so on, you do worry. And I keep saying to my partners, is this easy to put money in? How are we going to get money out? Fundamentally, I'll just give you an anecdote here, having been in Beijing recently and having been visited China a lot over the years. You know, you just sense, if you wander around Beijing now and you, for some may have a comment, you know it's not going to go back anymore. It just has gone to, honestly, I'm just telling you that, you just have this feeling. So that's an anecdote. It just gone so far. It's just amazing. At the same time, to my point that I mentioned before, we're treating it cautiously. So we're treading cautiously. And so we know that it would be ridiculous to go and just totally divert all of our dollars. So we're handling things carefully. We're working closely with the companies in the country and those companies are working closely with the governments. And so it is something where we have to, you know, work cautiously, learn more. And that's just what we have to do. We take risks, considered risks, cautiously risks. But we're seeing some really interesting opportunities, but we're investing wisely, I hope. Ask me again in five years. It's one more, I have to, yeah, won't you? I was still long ago, like, three to five years of life, I'm sure it's going to be in India. Do you intend to work any more investment or industry? We do, actually. So, you know, I was asked about our strategy long term from India. So I can't be specific about it, except to say that we do see an opportunity there right now. We have made two investments and we're really exploring how to participate in India. And so we know that we need to work with people who are there locally. And so if you look at our partnership, we have a De Laal, and a Versaun, and a Kapoor, and a Charter, and a Ramani. We've got them all. So, you know, we're very close and interested to the market, but we need to understand it more. And so I would say that it's very likely that we would have Mayfield India in that time frame, how it would be structured, and how we would target our investments, I don't know yet. Thank you. So thank you very much. Thank you.
