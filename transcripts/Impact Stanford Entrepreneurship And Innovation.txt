 You are listening to the DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Series, brought to you weekly by the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. You can find podcasts and videos of these lectures online at eCorner.stanford.edu. Today we are proud to be hosting some very special guests at ETL. As we discuss the entrepreneurial environment of Stanford and the results of the recent Stanford Innovation Survey, which sought to assess the university's economic impact based on entrepreneurial activity by alumni, faculty, and staff. And of course, we want to acknowledge and thank Sequoia Capital for generously funding the Stanford Innovation Survey. To tee up this discussion, I would now like to welcome up the authors of the Stanford Innovation Project, Stanford Innovation Report, MS&E Assistant Professor Chuck Easley, and Professor Emeritus from the Graduate School of Business, Bill Miller, to share some of the central findings and historical context of the results from the survey. Gentlemen? Well, Heidi, thank you very much for the introduction and getting us all started here. I just want to say one thing. Here at Stanford, we're talking about teaching young entrepreneurs to be young people to be entrepreneurs. You know, you can be an old entrepreneur. It's okay. I'm an old entrepreneur. And if you miss that chance when you're young, you still have a chance when you're old, so don't forget that. But I want to put some context into this report. We talk about a lot about entrepreneurship, and that's very big, and you'll see here some results from Chuck that they're very impressive. But Stanford is about a lot more than just entrepreneurship. I just want to put that context. We have a lot of interest in the arts and the humanities and so forth, and our students explore this. In the first two years of the undergraduate, most of you are undergraduates, no, you don't have to declare your major until you decide what you want to do. We think entrepreneurship is a career choice among many career choices, and some students will want to be poets, they'll want to be biologists, they'll want to be lawyers, and some will want to be entrepreneurs. And so for those who want to be entrepreneurs, we have a lot of ways that we can help them. So it is a career choice, and we help them on that career. Because we have workshops, we have courses like this, we have mentors who will help them develop their skills, learn the skills of entrepreneurship, and get mentored on what is that they can do to become better entrepreneurs. So we've had a large number of them across the university, not just out of engineering, not just out of school of business. We have social entrepreneurs, and as Chuck I think may report that we've had a lot of non-profits started by Stanford graduates, almost as many as for-profits started by Stanford graduate. So we have a very broad sense of education. And that was always very important to me because my father was a farmer, but my mother was a classics professor. So I had to learn a lot of classics, and I felt that breadth was very important to me when I began to think about things like starting companies. I started a little bit later in life than many of you, but that breadth of knowledge was very important. So getting that breadth, we think, is critical. So now we're going to hear from Chuck. And he's going to talk about more of the details of the report. Okay, thank you Bill. So this all started for me a few years ago when I first arrived at Stanford back in the summer of 2009. And like all of you, you start seeing the examples and hearing these stories about successful entrepreneurs and alumni and faculty going on to start companies out of their research and their technology. And so I began to wonder what's the overall impact of all of this? If we were to sum together the aggregate of all of this entrepreneurial activity that Stanford is producing through students, through alumni who have passed through Stanford and been exposed to the entrepreneurial environment or been exposed to some new technology through faculty, what would the aggregate results of that be? And so I set out to do a survey of all Stanford alumni, faculty, and staff. And so this was a large undertaking. Obviously, we sent the survey out to 143,000 Stanford alumni. So this covers across the schools, across graduation years. So we got responses from alumni going back from the 1930s up through graduates from 2010. And so we got back out of these 143,000. And we got back 27,000 responses. So this is both from entrepreneurs and from non-entreiners. And so if you use that data, which took a lot of time to crunch the numbers and add all of this up, you wind up with 39,900 still surviving companies have been created over the decades by Stanford alumni and faculty, which have created 5.4 million new jobs and annual worldwide revenues of $2.7 trillion. So Stanford on the whole is having a large impact on the economy, both locally and globally. And Stanford is on the whole importing founders into the state of California. So just under 35% of the newly admitted students at Stanford are from California, but 45% of the alumni founders wind up founding their companies in California. So I just want to highlight two other quick results. And then there's a lot more in the report, which you can download from the website. But two other interesting results just to kind of peak your interest. One is as students, you may be looking out at the various programs and business playing competitions and courses. And wondering, should I get involved in these? Should I work on my startup on the side? What should I do? And so we asked people who responded to the survey, these are graduates going back in time, which aspects of Stanford did you interact with and were important in founding your venture? And so we gave them various options for taking an entrepreneurship course, participating in a business playing competition and so on. And so as you might expect, those who were innovators who produced some sort of patent new business process, new product, and those who were entrepreneurs were slightly more likely to take these entrepreneurship courses. So the surprising result came when we looked at those who founded a company within three years of graduating and who had managed to raise venture capital in their firms. So 25% of the innovators and entrepreneurs in the aggregate had participated in an entrepreneurship course of some type. But 60% of those quick founders who had been able to raise venture capital within three years had taken an entrepreneurship course. And similar results for the programs and business playing competitions, STVPs, Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, and the D-School. The other interesting result comes around, we asked the founders if they had changed their business model. So we asked them, is the business that you're running now very similar to the business model, the vision that you had in the beginning? And we gave them several categories. Did the target customers change? Did the revenue model change? Did the sales channels change? And so we found that 60% of the founders indicated that they had changed the business model from the beginning. And in particular, only 13% said they had the same target customers as they thought they would in the beginning. So the classic thing looked to your left, looked to your right. If you look to your left, then probably if you're all founders, the person to your left is going to wind up changing their target customer from what they think it would be. And if there are 200 people in the room, then perhaps only 26 of you are going to wind up choosing the right initial target customer in the beginning. So we also looked at the performance implications of this. And I'll tell you just briefly a couple of interesting results. So when you look on the whole, those who had changed their business model have slightly lower performance than those who stayed with their initial vision. The differences aren't large, but median revenues of 150,000 compared to 200,000. But when you look in particular at the software and internet firms, those who had changed their business model in some way wind up having higher revenues than those who did not. So about 500,000 median revenues compared to 200,000. So I think that this shows that one, it's perhaps more about the insights into the correct business model that you get than about a particular number of times or whether you've changed the business model or not. And the second thing is that there may be some industry differences, where particularly for software and internet firms, where uncertainty is higher, then there may be a bit more benefit from these changes. So those are the quick findings that I wanted to leave you with. These are some of the early results. There's a lot more in the report that's available for download and a lot more that will be looking at as the research group continues with this going forward. So I'll go ahead and turn it back over to Heidi. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I encourage you all to look at the report. It's absolutely fascinating. I mean, really, really amazing stuff there. So I think what we're going to try to do now is put a personal face on the idea of Stanford and entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial alumni. And if I can ask our alumni guests to come up and join me here. And I think what we're going to do is we're going to try to take a while to run through some questions that I get to ask first because I'm up here and you're not. And then you guys can chime in with some questions before we run out of time at 530. So what I thought we'd first do is I'd like each of you to introduce yourselves. My name is Kit Rogers and I am a graduate class of 1996 in product design. Anybody study product design? Oh my gosh. I'll see. Yes. Okay. So I studied product design and came here being pre-med. Actually, I think who here at least came being pre-med at least. All right, a few. So did that was a walk on the football team had never played football before. That was kind of an interesting experience. And because of that entrepreneurial experience, which resulted in a lot of bruises and late nights, Tom Biers recruited me into what became the Mayfield Fellows Program. And I ended up being in the first year of the Mayfield Fellows Program. I studied engineering management for my graduate degree, which was part of the industrial engineering department. And now a veteran of four startup companies after graduating from that. Fantastic. Well, I also came here looking to be pre-med studied human biology for two years. And then dropped out to start a biotechnology company, STEMSELT, Theronostics. In the process, I've also founded an industry-specific vertical within StartX, called StartX, Med to support other medical innovators coming out of Stanford. It's a bit more present than me. I came to think I was going to be a computer science, and it turns out I was a computer science. So I'm also not super creative. I didn't pivot. I was class of 04 undergrad, 05 co-term. I also did walk on to the crew team having never rode in my life before. That was interesting. And fewer bruises and more sore muscles maybe. But it worked out pretty well. I joined the Maple Fellows program in Oakport. Tom and Tina got me to. One of the better things I think I did at Stanford. And then actually stayed with my Maple Internship full-time after school for a while at Fortify. Went to Microsoft for a couple of years and then started a company with another Stanford CS grad and Maple Fellow Clara that we now run that company. And with the generous help of Reloft's bank account. Thank you. I'm a Reloft Booter. I'm originally from South Africa. It came to Stanford in 1998 to go to the business school and was attracted to come to Silicon Valley because of the promise of entrepreneurship. Living very far away from here, it seemed an incredible place of innovation and sort of a willingness to experiment and take on the world. Before graduating in 2000, actually didn't drop out, but I joined a little company at the time called PayPal. Which was down the street at the University Avenue. Actually in the same office that Google had on University Ave. And I worked for them part-time for once a semester before I joined full-time and I eventually became the CFO to take the company public in 2002. And after that I joined Sequoia Capital where I've been since the beginning of 2003. Invested in a couple of companies that include YouTube, Square, Evernote, a couple of companies like that. When I checked earlier today, half the companies that I'm involved with have standard founders. And I've spent a lot of time coming back to Stanford University and certainly have lived firsthand a lot of observations from the report in terms of this positive feedback cycle and loop between industry, faculty and students. And I certainly attended this class just over 10 years ago myself. Thank you. And I do want to state for the record that I also was a Stanford undergrad class of 80. I got my degree in creative writing. And then I went out into the workforce and I discovered that creative writing degrees were not super highly valued. But, but, tandem computers was just getting off the ground and they needed someone to write their company newspaper. And I only bring this up because I want all of you who are getting English degrees or writing degrees to understand that it really does have value when you get out there in the real world and have to communicate. And when people say to me, you know, what's been one of your most valuable skills from Stanford, I gotta tell you, writing and communicating has been tremendously valuable to me. So I did come back and get an MBA and started a company right out of business school with my brother who was a computer science guy, although from Cal. But that's okay. Somebody has to hire them. No. I shouldn't say that. I know. I know. I get in trouble. So moving right along. You know, Chuck mentioned that approximately 25% of the technical innovators said that they took an entrepreneurship course at Stanford. So I'm just wondering if any of you did you did you take entrepreneurial courses at Stanford? How do you think that influenced you in your entrepreneurial endeavors after that? And I'm just going to throw them open in any one of you want to say something, any one of you want to tag on, go knock yourself out. I just took this class. This one is that company's one class, certainly after I focused and I didn't make the thought of it. But it made for the was was three classes really and that was huge. That was probably one of the more formative experiences for me, both at Stanford and as a founder. We go back to that today. I was telling somebody earlier, I think John has walked in that probably half of my best friends in college are from the Nathan program in addition to my co founder. Five four or five people with the company and I mostly like to support. Any classes? Sure, Mayfield fellow also before it was called Mayfield Fellows and you know very close with my classmates there as well. So that actually very much did expose me to the world of entrepreneurship before that. I'm not sure I could have spelt it. Still have trouble with it honestly. And it was a really great experience before that I would have become a doctor and that would have been two but I'm kind of open a whole new world up to me and after that just have been four startups in a row as I mentioned. So for me that was the one class. Not sure there were a lot of other classes back in the mid 90s about entrepreneurship. Maybe they were one or two but it's not like it is now. So for example, the first campus reputation today is huge as an epicenter of entrepreneurship. And the study also indicated that 55% of the respondents who became entrepreneurs in the last decade chose Stanford in part because of its entrepreneurial environment. For each of you why Stanford did that have anything to do with why you chose to come here. As I mentioned earlier it was a huge deciding factor and I didn't really understand what it meant to be here. I'd never been in the United States before I arrived in August of 98 to come here but it was a huge variable on my decision making. It's actually interesting one of the things that the report shows that the percentage of people who choose Stanford for entrepreneurship is increasing over time. And that to me is sort of very interesting that you get the self reinforcing effect of the faculty that's here is entrepreneurly minded or interested in collaboration with industry. The students who come self select and are selected for those attributes and then this whole environment whether it's the classes, the people you get to meet in guest lectures, your fellow students all just creates this infectious environment. And of course that's mirrored in the amount of concentration of venture capital also being invested in this area. So it's a very virtuous cycle. Anyone else about Stanford and other choices why you did or didn't come? Yes. It's completely chose Stanford because of its entrepreneurial environment. I think when I applied to Stanford I didn't really know what entrepreneurship meant. But I think it's embodied like it was mentioned earlier in all the students in all the faculty members and to me it kind of means this sense of being open minded and this almost infectious personality type of people that just aren't afraid to take risks. So definitely do me to Stanford. In my particular case it had nothing to do with it actually. I just kind of stumbled in here. The reason I came here three generations of my family went to Cal. And so I was contrary in any way and division one sports and great academics was something I was interested in. So I came and I think the entrepreneurial environment maybe wasn't as well articulated back then as it is now. But you just kind of get swept up in it and you kind of stumble from a pre-med class to product design to starting companies. And it was just the environment that enabled that to happen. It was not a conscious decision in my case. I think there's an important variable which I haven't been able to find in the report yet which I think explains why a lot of other people here too and explains the success of Stanford which is the weather. So the funny thing was I chose Stanford over MIT. And I was computer science and I wanted to do that and it was the two options. I kind of over generalist probably but thought of MIT as a research institution and Stanford as a business institution. Because it was the dot com bubble when I was making my decision. And there's all these guys and gals of Stanford that are in the front page of every magazine and paper launching these giant companies that are worth billions of dollars in a night. And they're being really successful in building this really cool technology. That was kind of the cutting edge. And MIT was always in the paper for media lab and crazy stuff that wasn't going to see light a day for a while but was going to be very fundamental. I went and visited both the funny thing was MIT had much better weather during the admin week. Great Dan Boston and terrible and rainy here the whole. But I came anyways specifically business and I think the thing that to me it wasn't I didn't call it on the leadership or understand it was the time. But it was very much about the kind of generalist attitude of people at Stanford that was I'm going to go do lots of different things. There were a ton of people who did really crazy academics and played sports which was really interesting. There's a lot of people who did a bunch of research and seem to actually be having a really good time. In addition to working really hard. And so to me it was actually the fact that people did a lot of mixed discipline stuff. I was really jealous that the D school started the year I left and not the beginning of it. Because that's one of the kind of best examples of interdisciplinary studies that we've done in a real kind of life way. Back in touch on the interdisciplinary stuff in a little bit as well because I do think that's an important part of Stanford and the Stanford experience. So going back to entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial studying specifically and entrepreneurs. When I was here as a business school student in the 80s and my brother actually he hired me I will stake that for the record because he'll probably watch or he'll tell him to watch this and I'll get in trouble. So he hired me in spite of my MBA from Stanford which he felt had no value in terms of what we were doing. But then my first act was to talk him into letting Nico found it as the CEO. So I'll just let you be the judge of the value of that degree. But anyway back then I remember specifically a classmate of mine saying to me I cannot believe you just spent all this time and money to get a Stanford MBA and you're going to throw it away by going to a startup and working with your brother for no money. So and I remember at the time it was very unusual. I think one of the interesting things about being on campus today is when you walk into a classroom and you say who wants to be an entrepreneur. And I know in my time as an educator here sometimes people are just dying to be entrepreneurs but they will admit that they don't really know what they want to do. They're just so excited about being an entrepreneur they want to be an entrepreneur. The point of this is so we have a lot of entrepreneurship education but probably everybody's not going to start their own companies. So what advice do you have for students in terms of what is the value of entrepreneurship education whether or not you're going to be an entrepreneur and how should you go about navigating what you think you ought to be doing. You're first to have with that because it's something we've thought about a lot of it's just the number of entrepreneurship is not synonymous with being a founder. And there's a pioneering spirit and entrepreneurship spirit that pervades Stanford and I think a lot of the people who have that entrepreneurial drive go be employee number five or 50 at a great company and live out that entrepreneurship spirit that willingness to take on challenges to question the conventional wisdom and don't confuse that with necessarily starting your own company. Because if you don't have that right idea then you shouldn't start it if you're asking people for permission whether or not you should start a company then you don't have the right idea yet. So be patient and join another company first. And to me at least if you look at the people that have spun out of PayPal over the years you know many of them have subsequently become founders but they weren't founders of PayPal. So the LinkedIn founders the Yelp founders the YouTube founders they were all you know Yammer founders they were all at PayPal but none of them were the founders of PayPal but they learned a lot they clearly had entrepreneurial spirit and they took that to subsequently subsequently start companies. As any of you as you look to also hire and bring people on to your teams do you think about entrepreneurial education or how do you look for that entrepreneurial spirit. We definitely look for it and I can't honestly get that I think we're very good at judging it. We talked about it and we think about it but it's not like we have a secret question that we ask but I mean I think to a lot of point you don't have to be a founder to be an entrepreneur. And that's our most of our company all of our companies at this point is about 100 people are entrepreneurs in the risk that they take in the way that they forget. I forget Tom and Tina please don't come up and hit the ruler but I forget the definition of entrepreneurship but it has something to do with you know basically doing extraordinary things with incredibly constrained resources and you think about startups everybody in startup has to be successful. I think the most interesting question that I've heard people ask that I've kind of stolen has been why are you doing this. If you could fast forward because a lot of people I've seen get into entrepreneurship because they see the big rewards and they see Kevin and system from Instagram. It's a great story and Kevin's company is going to stand for it and we've got a quite a big thing and people I want to go start a company because I want to be like that. And the most interesting question I've heard and some of our early employees asked Clara and I did so that was really cool. Why are you guys doing this. What if you sold the company tomorrow what would you do. And the answer for both of us was start another company right or keep doing this thing and kind of you know we take a week off and go have a nice vacation and then we're harder and it wasn't about that would be great we'd done we're successful it was kind of like we're doing it because it's fun. If you didn't sell it you cared. Yes but but it's really about being a building something cool. Exactly. We care about it. In the micro company you know I've been there for nine nine and a half years and we were acquired of last year and all of us are still at the company. So we did it because it was the right business move at the time it gave us the right platform to grow the business in a way that we needed to scale it and we weren't going to be able to do that on our own. But we're all still there and all intend to be there for a long time. So and we're growing like crazy now and as we bring people in we're asking about attributes like can you build a business inside of this framework and how do you be entrepreneurial within this framework and that type of thing. So it does bleed into our way of thinking as we're designing new products and bringing them to market for sure. I think one of these we've talked about a lot certainly in our classes and I think we've seen the evidence of this is anytime an entrepreneur. It is financially motivated to be an entrepreneur. It's sort of a failing proposition. Not that you can't think that if there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow that's nice. But anybody who's motivated that that's their goal in my experience at least I've seen them fail over and over and over again because you just don't have the fortitude to stick through the difficult times and the reality is that while we like to read about Instagram or whatever. I tell my students yeah and every week someone wins the lottery too but that's not necessarily you so. But you know what's interesting also in this study goes into this is there are a number of entrepreneurs who set out and build things never intending to make money and that would be the social entrepreneurs. The study survey stated that some 30,000 nonprofits have been created by Stanford alumni. I'm just wondering whether any of you have had experience with those folks have you done anything like that do you think it's unique to the Stanford culture do you think it's part of a move I mean what's going on with with that. I involved with start X which is a great nonprofit organization and I think it the nonprofit organization mentality is really reflected in the Stanford community and that it's all about how can we help each other to move forward and it isn't really kind of a selfish you know what's in it for me it's very much a pay it forward mentality which I think is embodied by by almost every single Stanford students that's here. Are any of you involved either at the board level or otherwise with some of these nonprofits a couple of nonprofits in the area and have several friends who have started socially oriented companies and and giving a lot of my money to those types of endeavors and drive an electric car and all that stuff so you know when you're when you're in this area you kind of do it I think and it just becomes a part of a part of your ethos and when you are successful you want to give back and do some things. I'm not sure 30,000 is a staggering number and it's really really impressive and I guess I'm not surprised. I know that I tell you know I coach a lot of particularly women in terms of a learning entrepreneurship learning corporate governance and one of the things that I encourage them to do is get involved with social entrepreneurship get involved with that particularly at the at the board level a lot of these things to go in and roll up their sleeves and do something because you are a great person. I think you can do something because you really learn a lot as well about interpersonal dynamics and and all of the attributes of a startup I think and even more so because certain avenues are you know in a way certain avenues are not available to you in terms of traditional financing and all of that but in other ways I think certain avenues are open to you in ways that are very different and I think it's been a really great experience I know it has been for me. There's a lot more accommodating for those types of startups than maybe some other places on the planet so you know we're in a good place for all kinds of startups I think. So talking about this region should Stanford do more for this region is there something Stanford should do as a member of the greater community here that it's currently not doing any ideas. Our first and I don't know if this might be a controversy or not I'm actually a really firm believer in kind of focus and dedication to a single mission and so I would actually argue that no Stanford is doing exactly what it should do and it should focus entirely on building great people around it and and not mix the rest of the kind of whether it's non-profit worker community service work like let the people who are really good at that do that work and Stanford is really good at educating really bright people but I think no it's actually really double down on mission. Good point. I would like them to allow dogs back at the dish but other than that they're doing a good job. Yeah and more parking. Okay we're done though that's it. I mean has Stanford benefited more from the businesses that have been started in the area or is it the other way around I mean it's a pretty synergistic situation obviously and difficult to be replicated anywhere else I think. It's an interesting question I what more could Stanford do I mean one of the things Stanford does a great job of for example is allowing professors to break away from their professorship they discover a cool technology and then go start a company and then come back and so. That facilitating that kind of a thing is really really cool and I'm not sure if that's done other places or not but I know a couple of examples here where that's been done. I think the other thing Stanford does and certainly I'm obvious there's a number of us who are like this is Stanford welcomes people from the technical entrepreneurial community to come back and play a role in the education here and I know whether it's a more formal level like we do where we actually teach a whole quarter of a course or. Whether it's coming in doing BBL's or whatever it is I think Stanford has been very open and welcoming and you know I certainly always encourage alumni to come back and frankly I think because it's very energizing both for the alumni and the students but I think it's something that I hope Stanford will continue to do is encourage people to come on board here. So I certainly know I've traveled around and being from Silicon Valley you know I've been to Silicon Valley, Silicon Alley, Silicon Fjord, Silicon Prairie and certainly also Stanford has a number of relationships with important other educational institutions around the world where they are really trying to learn the best practices not only of our entrepreneurial education but of the of the ecosystem that makes it work the Stanford ecosystem. And I think it's one of the things that's very hard to capture. What do you all think about broader than just Stanford but the the ecosystem in which Stanford plays a role here and if you would give advice to anywhere else are there things that can be duplicated are there things that can be not duplicated if you were sitting some in Silicon Fjord. What would you do to bring what Stanford has to to those places. I've certainly thought about this a lot and I get asked this question and I go back to South Africa when people look at the success that we've had here and I think one of the first things I tell them is think about it the same way you think about building a company which is you have to start small and you have to start iterating because the truth is what would we all benefit from today took a century to build. If you go back and a lot of this is captured in the report one of the first companies in Iran this area was federal telegraph and professor termine who had a huge influence on Stanford's collaboration with industry work there for a while before he became a professor of engineering and then he taught you let in pack hard and a bunch of other very well known industrialists he funded some of them those companies then spawn successive companies and then you have this whole phenomenon in economics school. It's a place in the Bay Area where you have not only the research institutions Stanford giving rise to these wonderful innovations that can help spawn companies but you have all ecosystem of the sort of people who go work there not just the Stanford professor of student who start something but all the other people that can make it happen whether it's financing or landlords that understand how to work with startups or lawyers who understand to work with startups and you get a whole ecosystem developing and you can't transplant that. It's the same reason you can't just transplant fashion from Milan and plonker down somewhere else in the world you know diamond cutting and Belgium or whatever the case is so if you want to replicate what is here you have to very patiently start to build and you need to create the right foundations including things like protection of intellectual property very clean and efficient bankruptcy system and these are all things that are taken for granted when you live in a place like this and they're all necessary institutions for you to encourage the formation of new ventures. So I think it can be done in a long time ago fleet streets in London or several row were you know the top of the industries and print and fashion or you know suit making and those have gone by the way side as other people have innovated so it can be done but you've got to be patient and you really have to make sure you get all the pieces necessary. I mean there's a sense here that you can fail and that's okay also and that is not shared in other parts of the planet you know I mean personal bankruptcy or company fails I mean in a lot of other cultures difficult to get back up from that and even get a decent job at a big company after that whereas here I mean I we may have a huge number of successful startups we also have a huge number of failures probably more than most places. So yeah not you guys it's a koia but that's right yeah but I think that's that's part of it as well so there's an attitude about starting companies and maybe succeeding and maybe missing. The thing that I wondered about is can you replicate that because there was something very unique about the West you know in the late 19th century about being a pioneer it was a new place you know it was a very non-denominational you know equal access and it's it really was a meritocracy I mean I'm sure it wasn't perfect meritocracy but when the world could you find a better meritocracy and you look around the world and you know can you replicate that somewhere else so there's a former Stanford professor Paul Romer who's been on an endeavor to both charter cities and how many of you are familiar with with these plans for this and that to me in a way is actually one of the most interesting ideas of replicating what Silicon Valley has because it takes gives you an opportunity to do that. It gives you an opportunity to take a piece of land and really start with a clean slate and maybe that gives you the opportunity to to engender that kind of culture but I think many parts of the world failure is such a you know such a burden on the individual that they wouldn't risk building a company. I wonder I mean I certainly know there's been successes of if you if you will colonizing entrepreneurship and I certainly know of a number of success stories in the 90s and 2000s of students coming here and seeing something. Like an eBay take off and say we're going to go be the eBay of name your country go there and do it and and have tremendous successes I'm back I'm curious it does study if the company was founded outside the US but by a Stanford student were you did you capture that okay and and what percent of the total revenue I know it's not fair to really ask this but I presume there's actually a significant amount of activity outside the US by Stanford students. Right. Number of getting into Stanford is increasing over the decades and then the percent of about 15 percent wind up staying in the area but you're right I don't have the number of the top of my head but we could go back and count you. The question is anecdotally I at least know of a number of students who who understood that coming here learning the best practices and seeing what was generating escape velocity escape velocity out in the marketplace going back and doing it back in their own home territory created some some generous future donors for the university I hope. I know created some great companies. Some of the big new Chinese companies would be in the survey and they were started by Stanford graduates right right that'd be really interesting. So that's another little context about the size I didn't mention it earlier but the 2.7 trillion of two points Chuck 2.7 trillion is half the GDP of China. Now revenues and GDP aren't the same thing but it gives you a context of how big that really is. Yeah it's a big what it was that it would be the 10 largest economy in the world if it were Stanford the country of Stanford there's a thought for you. It's fast I'm going to have to. So back to multidisciplinary I want to touch on that before we go on I you know for me as a creative writing major my multidisciplinary endeavor undergrad was I took CS 106 and I and I grad and I passed and I used punch cards but maybe I should say last class to use punch cards so I probably shouldn't say that but but anyway we talked about a little bit interdisciplinary and going and doing something different from your core. I love to hear from each of you or any of you what was your most what do you remember as your best interdisciplinary experience. So at this I think the Stanford School of Medicine does a fantastic job of this it's literally mixing like surgery with computer science with mechanical engineering I worked at the stem cell Institute for two years doing research I think I think our most important breakthroughs and technological advancements were literally from from other professors from other departments coming in and saying hey have you guys ever thought of you know attaching electrodes to those cells or have you ever thought about passing a curve. I thought about passing a current through something and either just things that I feel like individuals are so siloed in in their own particular research areas that in any other institution if you didn't have that kind of cross pollination ideas and that constant dialogue between people you just wouldn't get those advancements. It's physically obvious when you come here now we were commenting before we came in I mean the buildings that are here that weren't here even 10 years ago and they're all right next to each other and they're physically facilitating cross pollination between the different departments is amazing I mean I studied product design which is a hybrid of mechanical engineering and art design and at the time that was a really big deal and now it's it's those types of people working with people in the med school working with people in the double E department. I mean it's it's really fantastic I think a lot of new businesses are going to come out of those types of opportunities as opposed to the more traditional silo double E situation or CS only situation pretty exciting. Given the rigor of of technical undergrads I mean did any of you really go off the grid I mean dance class archeology touchy feely I mean you know. I took a I took policy was the time policy 138 was like national security strategy where we literally spent the time doing three day simulations of UN negotiation totally. It wasn't quite also I'm really uncoordinated so salsa would have been bad for everybody. Which is a little unusual here so that was fun yeah yeah any. Answer the question elliptically with another example sure so that was at the business school we were you know isolated across the street. It was a little harder to get access to the rest of campus but one of the companies we backed is with a Stanford graduate who got a PhD in electrical engineering undergrad physics who is Ashkenazi and he sister had a child that was born with a disease that killed a baby within a week of birth in 2002. He came back to Stanford as an associate professor and he spent over a year reading all the biology and genomics books that he could access to faculty. And he used that cross-ballination of EW training to solve problems in biology that the biologists and geneticists didn't have the inside for. And today he has this company that enables thousands of people to have healthy babies every year. That to me is a fantastic example of cross-ballinating disciplines to come up with breakthrough innovation. I have to say from teaching here one of the things I love about the course that I teach and I know this is true many other places is that we'll have freshmen with CS grad students with Sloan Fellows all in the same room talking about things. I really feel it's interesting because when the freshmen come into the class there's a natural inclination to look at the guy next to you who is twice your age and think oh my god I'm at a super disadvantage here because this person has more experience. And then it turns out that the dialogue is really amazing. And so I feel like there's also that opportunity to sort of cross-pollinate people from literally different generations at Stanford to be able to do things that are really interesting. I think it's one of the great things we have going for us here. So last question from me and then I'd love to open it up to the audience. There's been a great debate today about whether the whole higher education system is even relevant, appropriate state of the art. Stanford is of course leading the way with a tremendous amount of online education. Certainly a former key PayPal executive who might remain nameless has been talking about the fact that higher education might be obsolete and maybe you should all just save your money and not stay in school. That's the extreme view of that. But it is a question. I mean as I have students the poll of Silicon Valley, the poll to go stop out, take time off or take time leave and who knows when you're going to come back. And there are students who always say to me well you know that's what Bill Gates did and that's what Steve Jobs did and that's what Mark Zuckerberg did. And once again I have to say well the chance you're going to be one of them is small but anyway the point being there is a lot of attraction. To go out there's a lot of opportunity for Stanford students to stop studying and go do something else. How do you feel about that? What would you counsel someone who's a student here? Stay in school, do that. What would you do today and what would you recommend our students do? How different is that than an athlete getting the same opportunity? It's similar. I think it's you know for the right opportunity it can definitely be worth it. So I don't think I would be one to say stay in school no matter what. And Stanford has very liberal policies about such things. So that's nice in and of itself. You have to be really passionate and really good at something in order for that path to make sense in my mind. You have to sort of be a bit of a savant in a certain area or really exceptionally skilled in a particular technical area for that to make sense. For me I know I needed as much time as I could stay here to figure it out and I was here six years counting the code term and the seventh probably would have done me some good. So it was good to be here as long as I could at the time but that was my pace. I mean I'm obviously a little biased because I did stop out of school after the first two years. I do agree that unless there's the right opportunity and it's something you're really passionate about and something that if you're sitting in a classroom all you'd be thinking about is like I want to get back to that project. Probably not worth it but I will say at least in my own experience. It's been an incredible set of other skills that I've learned outside of the classroom that I think are invaluable. And again Stanford does have really liberal policies on coming back to school so if the right opportunity presents itself it's definitely worth you know if you're willing to take that risk and dive in definitely worth it. I know that's right I've always I've always told people ask me this about you know so I just try to stop out and do this and my attitude has always been I'm going to tell you know you shouldn't and as you turn around and say I'm doing it anyway then you're probably the right candidate to do this. Right which is like I think it's really an opportunity you're going to be so into it and so strong that somebody's telling you not to do it actually kind of doesn't matter and so on the flip side if you're if you're kind of like maybe I should maybe I shouldn't and some random guy like me says don't do it and you don't probably good you didn't. I think I've met many of the companies that are endeavoring to up end the education system and familiar with Khan Academy and you know love what they've enabled in terms of you know providing that sort of education if you're fingertips again having grown up in you know country very far from here it's wonderful to sit in Cape Town and be able to you know observe the lectures and learn from the best minds in the world and whatever you're chosen discipline is. And I'm sure this changes should be made at the margin with your standard curriculum and course of education because if you go back to you know the Renaissance the teaching was essentially the same with you know if you see pictures of what lectures look like 400 years ago 300 years ago they haven't really changed okay there's an opportunity to incorporate technology to make it different but I'd argue the biggest opportunity is post leaving a university it's the continuing education way I think it's pretty good. It's probably the biggest opportunity because so many people stop learning when they're 22 or 23 in the graduate and that you know that's terrible when you think about your whole lifetime and people just get stunted and I certainly got a lot of satisfaction out of taking one of the computer science classes that were offered through Stanford last year machine learning class I had a blast taking the course and programming again it was just fun to be able to test your limits and I wonder whether that's the real opportunity long term. The other subtle thing it often gets missed when you just look at you know could you learn faster you know could we all be in an accelerated program skip summers and you know just blast through your curriculum as quickly as you can but what about all those other social things that you learn along the way your ability to relate to others your ability to work in a group as a team to assume leadership to be to be led to negotiate with others because those are the sort of interpersonal skills that are hugely important to your success down the road. Your business school student as well classes that have stuck with me the most the decade later have been the softer classes things around leadership and human resource management and motivation very subtle things around how to get the most out of people. I think to follow on that I think entrepreneurship is a is a team sport for the most part and if you look at the founding teams the particularly successful ones very often they met at Stanford or met at their places of education. If you hadn't been in the room with the other person all that all those times would you have started a company with them and I think it is it's one of the interesting things I hear from the online entrepreneurs is how do I meet my founding team members because they don't have that experience so I think it's fantastic what Stanford is doing and the innovation that Stanford is trying to progress and doing it so much of it at no cost to the to the greater into the world community and it's a really incredible thing but I would argue that for students business my stay in school kids message but my argument is that I'm not going to be able to do it. I think Stanford is really intelligent to have a very lenient stopping out thing but there's a point at which you've stopped out too long and you can't and you sort of you just can't do it anymore so I would just encourage people that I think that the connections that you make here the relationships that you build here the type of learning that happens and you know I do believe the degree has value in many other ways as well. I know for me I got kind of tired of undergrad and then I left and then I came back to go to business school and I really appreciated classes more when I was a business school student so I do think coming and going is a good thing but I would encourage you to come back the other thing I think that is different today then certainly was when I was a student is if you're an entrepreneur you can almost you know get your entire degree done and focus on your company at the same time by taking all the courses in which you can explore things that are important to your company. And I see a lot of students doing that where they literally line up their courses and say okay I can do my marketing in this class and I'm going to do my development in this class and my business plan here and it's fascinating what you can do with Stanford and what they have to offer today. So anyway I'm going to open it up we have about 10 minutes for questions and yes please go ahead. My question is your time of your last question about the 20 year 20 program I myself was 10 years later and I had one interview experience of my new year phase and also one of the mentors fortunately not to be one of the mentors at the Fee Foundation 30 year 40 program. My question is you as one is is the interview something one tell you on or most of the reason someone is an entrepreneur and what they come with. That's one question and I'm sure they have a value but no much. And the second question I have is with respect to Silicon Valley obviously there are a lot of things going on for us here including the data data. What do you want to replicate in other parts of the US? What do you think that some of the considerations will be this week is being best, Texas and North America. Entrepreneurs can it be taught? That's an interesting question I think for a lot of people that end up coming here and I'll just speak about my particular case I hardly knew what it was when I got here so for me being exposed to entrepreneurship and people starting companies and doing all this neat stuff was sort of the first thing and so whether that existed somewhere. Deep down that I didn't know about beforehand and then was just revealed because I was in this environment I think is the my particular situation. I am one of the lieutenants in my current company I'm not the actual founder and the actual founder of the company is a brilliant technologist who's a little different than a lot of us and certainly different than me. He's special and I think there is an innate thing in a lot of people that allows them to start a company when it's very challenging to make a living doing that and we as a company have had our backs against the wall number of different times and then been successful kind of coming out of that so for me I wasn't the entrepreneur but part of a founding team and a very early employee was kind of more the role that made sense for me. I think that's something that only would have been unveiled had I been in a place like this. A lot of the skills so you can go learn sort of finance or you can go lore you can learn marketing or hiring whatever it is. I do think there's something a little bit different. There's a really interesting book written by a Hopkins med school prof called the hypomanic edge, the link between a little crazy and a lot of success in America. The argument basically goes that entrepreneurs are there's a high correlation between the way entrepreneurs describe themselves and the way that hypomanics describe themselves. And hypomania is basically a reduced version of manic depressive disorder. It's really interesting study but it basically says it's things like the ability to operate on very little sleep and lots of energy and the ability to kind of consistently be told no and not believe that you're wrong. Which by the way could be a really good or a really bad thing. But there's certain skills that you would kind of associate with entrepreneurs and kind of this category of being special as Kit gently put it. Most people just call it crazy that I don't know that you can teach. So I think there's kind of some qualities that are very inherent and just you either have a redone it's not a good or bad it's just different and there's a bunch of things you can very much learn about it. You can teach frameworks you can teach methodologies you can look at case studies see how other people have done things but when it comes time to actually making your own company you almost forget all that it's all in the moments all about how passionate you are you'll have 30 people telling you you can't do it but you're still going to push through and I think at that point pattern recognition becomes important. Like look I've seen I've read case studies are seen other people hit these same roadblocks. It's like kind of know what not to do but like there's no book on on how to make every single decision and how to kind of go and when once you've made the decision to start a company like what is the step by step on how to make it successful. Great entrepreneurs out there who I'm sure are not in places in the world where they have the ability to go out and start a company and the best pianist in the world may never have seen a piano right so who just has that innate capability inside of them so you know making sure that you're getting exposed to and aware of the ability to start a business that's important first step obviously. I don't know if they still do it when I got my acceptance letter to Stanford it came in this folder and the front was printed something along the lines of for all the nights you stayed up late to get something done for all the nights you didn't go out with your friends to finish to go the extra mile in that project blah blah blah like all these traits they considered special Stanford students I still have this folder today I read it and I was like wow like there's something inside of me that's kind of like wow that's really cool it's very similar to what of the traits I think you would kind of consider inherent in entrepreneurs. Maybe exactly your point with this study for something special about the way that Stanford chooses people are trans people. I think the other thing is why we're all here is because I've heard time and time again from students they say I wasn't sure I could do it and then I came and I met and I listened to someone you know any Taylor in another class and they talked about their failures and they sounded sort of like I think of myself and then they went off and were successful. And so I think a lot of times it is back to that pattern recognition if you know that someone else who sounds like you did did it it gives you that that moment to keep going and do it. I want to say before we run out of time that you can find the study at Bittley slash Stanford Innovation Study and I suspect if you search for it you'll probably find it too. But yeah so I think we have time for one or two more questions so yeah. Yes. I'm asking for a role about the Silicon Valley because it seems like there's a tremendous amount of money from the venture community going into software startups and not that much in hardware anymore. Now is it you guys going to lose the hardware design DA with that kind of thing? It's a very strong risk. That it'll lose it. I mean I'm involved with the hardware company Jawbone makes a jam box speaker and an Oincensing headset and they really struggle to find manufacturing talent because so much of that has left the Bay Area. So I think the best hope that it will stick around I mean there are a couple of people that have written about some of the hardware companies that are not innovating around the Bay Area. What they call app-sacery companies companies that are building you know hardware that a company is a piece of software and you're a smartphone you know to help it do what it does. I think that's the best chance we have of some interesting hardware companies around here. One more question. Let's see the right. Yes, yes you. So in the Stanford community there are other highly technical issues that innovators and people who are taking their research and making concrete out of it. But then there are other people in other places in the world that might not even have a policy to read that hard-fired young business. Maybe that's a more business, a more new life, and a bright strategy for that. So I guess I'll be fine the balance that he goes through. Yeah, well brought up in mind how far you try to innovate in your head and try to be creative about it before you say it or I can make a company out of it. The way that we've done it you go as fast as you can and go try it in the market right. This is whether you read Eric recently and start up or one of the 37 signals guys Jason Frieder, David Helmer Hansen, one said that if you look back at the product you launched originally and you're not embarrassed you waited too long to launch it. Right, the market's always right. So I think you go and you try to innovate in your head is kind of easy and fun in a way but it doesn't really tell you the truth that just tells you what you think. So I'd say go do it and you're right that's the interesting question of training. So a lot of people are entrepreneurs who have no formal training and at what's ever. I think you can make it easier better for you just. And and Silicon Valley certainly hasn't cornered the market on entrepreneurship. I mean it's alive and well all over the world are our society and our cultures were based on it. And I mean I think we shouldn't as well as as Stanford has done let's not lose sight of the fact that competitive is competitiveness is global at this point. And there's lots of really exciting things going on lots of other places by people who have that same attitude about striking out so. We are unfortunately out of time I want to thank our guests. Thank you for coming back to the farm.
