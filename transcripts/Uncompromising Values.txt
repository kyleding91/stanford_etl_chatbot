 Who you are defines how you build. This is the OddPattern thought leader series brought to you by Stanford E Corner. We're really excited to welcome Alexi Robo showed at ETL, Alexi is the co-founder and CEO of this really cool company better up. A mobile-based platform that brings personalized professional coaching to employees at all levels. Better up uses evidence-based assessments and machine learning to match employees to coaches who can encourage lasting behavior change. Now prior to better up Alexi was the director of product management at VMware leading all product and design teams to build enterprise collaboration software most you know VMware. He's also the co-founder and chairman of the Youth Leadership America, a non-profit that fosters peer-to-peer leadership development and civic engagement for high school students. And I think he actually started this when he was in high school as well. This is an amazing non-profit that he got off the ground. And he earned a BA in political science and non-profit management from the University of Southern California. Welcome Alexi. Hey, thanks man. I'm really excited to be here. How are you doing today? Good. How about yourself? Good. I'm doing great. Man, you and I have got a really great Q&A session and dialogue to go. So let's get into it. So the origin of your story and why you built better up and I'm really quite impressed with your really focus on preventative mental health, which is an often overlooked area. But from what I've read it sounds like better up came out of you connecting the dots between some really diverse interests and experiences. And I'd like to know if you can give us a short sort of compressed version of that. The origin of the story, how you connected those dots to find adventure that felt meaningful and important to you. Sure. No, thanks for the opportunity. I think, you know, I'll keep it short because the origin really does actually go back to high school for me. I find that I've been extremely fortunate and it felt like I was stumbling, but eventually stumbling upon a venture or an endeavor in life that really combined what had emerged as two great passions and sustained from high school. And the first chronologically was actually programming and coding. We moved to England my freshman year. It's a rainy place. If you haven't been there, it was, you know, dark at 4 p.m. half the year. And my little brother and I basically picked up web programming HTML, PHP, cold fusion, was still a thing back then, ASP, and started making websites for my dad's friends' companies. And when we came back through that, I started to get involved in some other school activities. And I had a buddy who had this idea for an after school club where we essentially would do peer-to-peer coaching on what we called at the time, life skills. And he had been reading a ton of Steve Covey and Napoleon Hill, Dale Carnegie, kind of some of the classic self-help literature. And was disenchanted. He had founded the Koana's Club at our school or the key club and was disenchanted with just the volunteerism, but just going to conferences and hearing speakers and not being able to put this stuff into practice. And so they needed someone to build a website. So I got looped in, I helped work on the website, helped start this organization that eventually would become a new leadership America. And that just ignited the need, this passion for this whole world of helping people realize their potential and the power of coaching and mentorship and practice. So fast forward, I ended up in my career following the first passion and ended up in Silicon Valley doing software was very fortunate to join my first start of social cast and we were fortunate enough to get acquired by VMware. And I became a very young executive at VMware. And was really, I think, at the time I was probably 26 at the most. I was pretty over-tasked and under-skilled, I would say. It was a huge opportunity. They were integrating a couple different acquisitions. They were trying to build a social enterprise team. I was helping to lead product and design for that. And I learned a ton during the integration in 18 months, but I also got extremely burnt out. I remember driving down from the SAP to Palo Alto for these executive meetings with like the CIOs and some of the world's largest companies and the CEO of VMware and just being completely nauseous, overwhelmed. So I eventually hit a point where I was like, hey, this isn't a great headspace for me. And I need to go do something else and type a fashion, you know, join the YC company the next week and went into YC. So I was not in a great mind space to do that either. And suffice it to say was, you know, a little overwhelmed and burnt out and was able to take some time off and figure out what I should do next. And I kept coming back to the kids and coaching them and came back to this insight of they had me helping them through their life transitions, which is like college apps or first job, resume building, first breakup at that age. And I was going through something significant in my life and I didn't really have anyone to help me. I could call my parents, but they live in Dallas, you know, a lot of this stuff in Silicon Valley while they're empathetic and supportive. They didn't have the context for. And so that started me in finding help and I didn't know what that was. So I tried everything from coaching to therapy to life coaching, executive coaching, the landmark form in Los Angeles. I walked the Camino de Santiago in Spain and really was at this tension of I kind of want the evidence-based scientific rigor and expertise of a clinician, but I want the business context of an executive coach. And I felt pulled like I had to pick between the two and I eventually found a coach who was a therapist by training who did executive coaching. And it was game changing and that was the seed of the idea for better up. It just kind of hit me. Like, how did I miss this? We should be doing what we did for these high school students, but upgrading it. If we did this, I had also been geeking out on this positive psychology. This would really be the missing equation in mental health today, which is there's not a powerful preventative layer. Most of mental health is secondary health care and we're not actually helping people preventatively develop the skills that buffer from anxiety or depression or stress or high blood pressure, all these things that I had experienced. And so with that, I pulled in my buddy Eddie who had been building it on profit with me, and went underground with me to USC. He was at Hoss, your friendly rival doing his MBA there. And he had a lot of conviction around social enterprise and ed tech and we had already been working together. And so we just started hacking on what I was pretty convinced would be one of the coolest products I had seen and potentially the world's worst business. And went nowhere for two years, as I like to say. So yeah, that was the story. And we can pick up on the rest later. Wow. Sometimes you know what? Most in opportune times become the most amazing opportunities if you pursue that. It seems like you had the vision and the drive and the passion to do that. So let's talk a little bit more about what BetterF does. So broadly speaking, I know it's professional coaching, but you put a number of really novel spins on that concept. This is not an easy space. Lots of businesses are looking for stuff that's going to accelerate their revenue or cost out of a P&L. So this is a big challenge. But you put as a system really novel spins on that concept. So just chair like what your mission is and really what's been unique about your approach and how you were able to crack some of this code here. Yeah, no thanks for the opportunity. So the mission of BetterUp is to help people pursue their life with greater clarity, purpose and passion. And I think you know, if you are a Maslow head like I am, the simplest way to think about that is we're really in the business of helping to foster and facilitate what he would have called self-actualization. Right? How do I help people increase their well-being and increase their potential and their performance? And so at the bedrock of BetterUp, and I think one of the things that was really unique when we were coming into the market was a pretty opinionated and I think fundamental belief in what we call our whole person approach is that if you are a professional and you are hurting on the inside, that is going to affect the outside. And so this divide we have in business today between, hey, it's the job of benefits to take care of like the health and well-being of the employees and it's the job of talent development or the line of business to take care of the performance of employees is an arbitrary budget driven divide that has like no grounding in anthropology, psychology or anything we know in the past 80 years of the human sciences. And if we really want to drive performance, the means to do that are not very different than if we really want to drive flourishing or thriving in your personal life. In fact, some of them especially as we increase in a knowledge economy and a creative economy, the skills that matter most are social, emotional and nature. And these are the same skills that build strong romantic relationships in some ways, strong work relationships, strong relationships with yourself in your own feelings. And that doesn't mean they can't be hard or hard-hitting. In fact, what we find is they are the secret sauce, the hidden lever to reach layers of productivity and innovation and creativity that you really can't just do with hard skills. And that's not to say you don't need hard skills, you of course need them. But what we found in the core belief behind Better Up was that we were perinially under-invested in helping people cultivate these social, emotional skills. And that shows up in conflict and work, that shows up in conflict and personal life, that shows up in things like absenteeism, that shows up in certain ailments. But there's this whole range of folks who may not like myself in my case, even though I was going to be there, I didn't actually have a clinical diagnosis. And I still wanted to realize my potential. I still wanted to flourish and thrive. And fortunately in the past three years, there's been a whole body of science and research and literature on how to do that. But really, until Better Up to my knowledge, no one was focused on operationalizing that. We're bringing that to life in a really scalable, personalized way. Yeah, that's awesome. So talk in more detail about the mental health aspect of the work. So first, I hidey-see professional coaching, connecting to the field of psychology, and to mental health. And then second, how does psychological research inform Better Up's approach? Because you're doing some really interesting stuff there. Sure. Well, I think it starts with our understanding of health, which physical health is a better no pun intended mental model than mental health. Because when we say mental health, what almost all of us I would wager to guess immediately visualize is mental illness. But when we say physical health, you don't think of the cold, right? You think of a gym. You think of fitness. You think of maybe running with some friends, right? We have a concept in physical health that healthiness is not merely the absence of disease. Healthiness is a net positive state of some amount of thriving or flourishing or healthfulness, whatever you want to call it. But sadly, when it comes to mental health, our mental model is pretty binary. Mental health is the absence of mental illness. And there hasn't been as much. And I would say, look, we started, we were doing this in 2013. A lot has changed since then. So encouragingly now, I think the dialogue socially is changing even in the last two months in some really positive, generative ways. But suffice it to say historically, we really haven't had a robust visual definition of, what does it look like to be mentally healthy? Well, what it looks like to be mentally healthy is not just to not maybe have mental illness, it looks like to have clarity as to your values, your goal, to have a sense of purpose we know. And to care about other people, to go from self-actualization to self-transcendence, as Mazda would say. It looks about having an abundance of energy. It doesn't mean you don't have a bad day. It looks about vitality or zest as we would get from some of the work at UPIN. Grit, if you think about Angela Duckwood, these are all psychological resources or attributes of healthy people. From a business stance, if we put on our capitalized hat, it looks like more engaged, more performant, more creative, and more sustainable employees. From a personal sense, it looks like people who are more centered, more grounded, more focused, and have a more clear sense of personal agency or power. And so for us, that is just, wow, where was that in the world, right? And so we realized that part of it was, we were behind the science, right? And I think one formula for innovation is when science is ahead of where technology is actually operationalized it in a way. We were behind, but there was also work to be done in the science. So one thing we built together with BetterUp is a group called BetterUp Labs. And so BetterUp Labs is a part of BetterUp that works with some of the world's leading researchers like Adam Grant at the University of Pennsylvania, Martin Seligman at the University of Pennsylvania, Sonya Vroomerski at UCR, who are really at the forefront of organizational and positive psychology. And they're specifically focused on not just productizing that, but actually furthering the research and science to benefit everyone, whether or not you may ever cross paths with BetterUp at all. And so they do everything from research products on our platform to research research studies in the field along this vector of how do we increase our visual and our data on people's inner life and the connection between the state of one's inner life and the ability to have meaningful relationships, happiness, and flourishing in the rest of your life. That's fantastic. Yeah, you're hitting on such an important, huge new area because it's usually easy to tell if someone, they're physically not well, they have some optical vision of that. But when you're talking about how someone's feeling, how happy they are, how confident they are, and really being able to change that and tap into that, you and I both know that the happier you are with yourself, the better you're going to do in your personal relationships, the better you're going to do in your career, the better father you're going to be, and this is a better person you're going to be. I think you've unlocked so much of productivity value, leadership qualities, retaining culture. So it just seems like just a massive area and opportunity for you guys. So off to a great start. Okay. I know a topic that's near and dear to us here at Stanford is really all about ethics and entrepreneurship and especially reframing the role of the corporation and Silicon Valley when it comes to building new technologies and balancing profits with values. That's really quite a unique spectrum to be working with. But at STBP, we've been thinking a lot about how values and principles and ethics can be activated throughout your entrepreneurship. So would you describe the values that have guided better up? Because the dot to me is the better rock and cornerstone of who you are and your entire ethos, right? Sure. Yeah. So I will say, you know, there are canonically a better up. Actually, this is one of the earliest things Eddie and I had the privilege of setting and we haven't changed them. It's not that we're not open to changing. It just seems like they haven't need. They still seem timeless and employees and our customers still rally around them. There's six of them. But before I do that, I'll say they really come from three kind of core aspirations we had in building the company that were, you know, I think kind of the holding context for the values. And the first is, you know, I had been in Silicon Valley and remember this is 2010-ish, a different era, right? The era of social, right? A lot of different technologies you were here to be were in though then. And you know, you're starting to see the rise of the gig economy and I had grown up originally in Dallas and for me and for Eddie who grew up in Peru, one of our first big aspirations about better up is we really wanted to create something that would be able to be accessible for as many people as possible, right? And how do we create something that appeals to people from all different walks of life, both from a, I, I, diversity standpoint, yes, across factors such as, you know, nationality, country, gender, creed, all that, but also cognitively help people live and learn. And so that was the first core aspiration is we really wanted to make something that would appeal to someone in Alabama as much as it could appeal to someone in New York City, right? And at the time, there wasn't a lot of the new technology we found that, you know, my friends in Dallas would have felt relevant to their life, maybe outside of Instagram, honestly, right? And so that was a core inspiration and aspiration that informed our values. The second is, and this is a little audacious, but, you know, for us, I'm a big believer in like what I call the old Silicon Valley, like the Silicon Valley of Steve Jobs and before, where it was like the crazy ideas of how are we, you know, I think Elon Musk and a few other entrepreneurs kind of exclusively do this today, but where are the true moonshots? Like literally get to the moon. We went through a decade of great innovation, but a lot of it was around entertainment and that's great. I start my career at Disney, you know, love entertainment. But for us, there was this really aspiration of, you know, one aspect of the human experience we are not innovating around is maybe the most profound aspect of the human experience, which is how do we actually improve the human condition? And if we can actually help people access greatest levels of flourishing, then that would be like, that would be the zenith of technology. And that sounds really woo-woo and really crazy, but as we talk more, there's a whole science around this. This stuff is actually now been figured out how to do just no one's doing it, right? So that was a huge aspiration. We didn't want to just make something like coaching more accessible, more affordable, sure. We actually wanted to make it better. Where if you're a coach or a therapist in a better hub, you are more effective. You are more impactful by using the technology than you would be in your private practice. And then the third component of that is the opportunity to create a huge brand, right, around making it cool and making it something that you identify with related to self-actualizing. And so the values that came out of that were really sick. They were a courage, both moral and what we call managerial courage and taking big bets, craftsmanship, right? We have to have a caliber experience bar. And people are going to trust us with their blind spots, their deep dark fears, their hopes, dreams, aspirations. This stuff can't look like a scam, right? It's got to be really elegant. It's got to be really stately. I always tell the team, when I was at Disney, the amount of energy and effort we would put into a churro cart is incredible. But that's to sell churros. Like if we're not putting 10 times that into an application where people are pouring out about their relationship with their spouse or manager, we'd miss the mark. Then empathy is huge. As you all know it, from the D school, innovation starts with empathy. As coaches, we're really in the business of empathy. And then zest and playfulness. And so those values today continue to really guy, oh, and grit is the other one. Those six values continue to grind and shake the company. I love this zest one. That one's awesome. That one just got what an incredible value. All right, man. So when we signed you up to speak at ETL, I'd start doing, and knew we were going to do this interview. I did some stocking on your Facebook page. And you've talked and read a lot about leadership. It's quite inspiring. But one of your posts that I read, you, from a fast company article that you cited, had a really interesting quote from Jeff Emelette, who was a former GE CEO about leadership. And the quote goes, leadership is the intense journey into yourself. And then you want to say we think about work exclusively represented by outer work. And what inner work and leadership qualities do you emphasize it better up to help businesses thrive in a 21st century? Yeah, no thanks. We try, man. We try to write a lot. But yeah, I think that's like the greatness understanding, right, is we still operate under this very industrial paradigm that your job is to do something outside of yourself. And of course, that's a huge part of your job. It's probably, in many ways, the majority of your job. But what should be a represented minority stake in your job is that you need to work on yourself. And if you have a clear set of values, if you have a clear set of internal priorities, if you feel centered and resolved, if you are better at emotional regulation, if you are better at removing conflict in your environment or in yourself, you are going to perform better. And this has been known for decades. I remember in high school starting at Sears as a salesperson. And part of the sales training was like, it's your job to have great relationships at home. Because if you have bad relationships at home, you will bring that energy and that anxiety to the customer interaction. This was, you know, in Sears training, who knows, maybe for a hundred years. What was missing is there's no time on the job for me to work in my relationships on home. And so I think one thing that we've done that's innovated on better up is we were very vocal about it is your job to do inner work. And you should be weaving that throughout your day, but we actually give a day a month additionally for you to be at work, not physically be at work, but to be working on yourself wherever you need to be. So if that's go take a nature walk, awesome. If that's go meditate, awesome. That's get on the phone with some folks where you need to make some apologies in life and you know, see some resolutions and situations. Awesome. But whatever it is, don't do out of work. Don't do the Excel model. Don't do the finance deck. Don't work on the new product. Just focus on yourself. And what we found is it's become an incredible source of energy for people. And to your earlier question, Toby, for me, it goes back to the ethics and why a company exists, right? If a company only exists as a means of production and the people engaged in the production are not bettered by the active producing, then companies are, they're kind of exhaustive, right? And they are draining from their own workforce. But if working itself can have a space where you leave energized, you leave enlightened, you leave a better version of yourself, then it's a much better win-win. And what we're finding is, at least in our experience, you get better work from folks. They're coming more energized back on those other days. They're having big ideas without even thinking about it on their inner work days. It's like they can't stop. They're like, oh my gosh, I just cracked this huge engineering problem you were trying to do because I wasn't thinking about it for a day. I was just focused on something else in my life. And so we found that, yes, as capitalists, we're reaping the benefit, sure. But most importantly, our employees and our teammates and our better-uppers, they're actually finding and discovering more themselves through their experience of better-up. And that, for me, gets to the core ethics of why the corporation exists and why as an entrepreneur, you're starting a company in the first place. I love it. That's awesome. So we had this insane idea. I've tapped into something that I think is quite extraordinary and incredibly valuable for people and companies and betterment of society. But taking an idea and actually making a company and scaling up it is one of the hardest things to do. And so let's talk a little bit about that. So given that values were really important to you, how did that affect some of the early decisions about how you brought on investors and board members and hired key people? And what that blueprint looked like? Yeah, and it's a great point. I mean, that is the hardest part. The idea it turns out to be relatively easy and retrospective. Doing something with it and we're still working progress. We're very early in what we hope to be a long, 100-year-plus journey. So I think, again, inner work's important. You've got to be clear on your values and you have to be vocal about them. You are starting something and part of the beauty of building something. And I wish I was even more courageous around this and in retrospect is you get to set the game board more than you think as an entrepreneur. And so sometimes, not always, you'll get to pick your investors and we were fortunate. And so I think to the heart of your question, what we did is we were very clear about what mattered to us and what we would not compromise on. And we knew we would not compromise on the individual confidentiality of data. So it's just not going to happen. In fact, Ryan or CTO joined me from VMware better up on the condition. We would never be an enterprise company because we were just so convinced based on our enterprise data experience that no company would let us help their people and not want to see what they're talking about. And it turns out, when we just told companies, we will not compromise on that. People were like, that's awesome. We wouldn't want you to. We actually want that confidentiality. And so we found that same before our investors. So as we thought about investors, we were fortunate in our rounds to really pick who we got to partner with. And then it was a question for Eddie and I, and what matters most? And what mattered most to us was the alignment around our moral mission in the world is to it's the mission to help people flourish and that we need to be aligned to doing that in an efficacious way, an honest way, and data and science can help us have integrity there. The litmus test we used to always know, ask ourselves is, hey, if we found out, if I had a show to award meeting one day with a big report from our lab team that said, hey, guess what? We actually found out that everything we're doing, people love, they use the heck out of, but it's bad for them. But they don't know that. They'll just keep paying us. They think this is amazing. Would that investor say we support you in hitting stop and rebuilding the whole company? If that investor would say like, well, I mean, is it really that bad? Like it's your MRR looks pretty nice right now. Can we just use that to fund? We wouldn't work with that person. And so it was kind of litmus tests like that where we really were saying, is this person thinking about long term value for the business by thinking about long term helping people? And there's almost a hit but critic lens to our business that we were able to optimize for. And so we've been very fortunate. And I think just having like the greatest board in the world. But I think part of that to be fair to Eddie and I is that we really made sure that they were aligned with our goals. Not just those goals, I would say from ethics, but even economically like Eddie and I were clear from day one, you know, we're not interested in acquisitions. We are, we think we need to be an independent company to have a moral agency to do what we want to do in the world. Our investors aligned with that. And that's a really serious conversation I have with every new investor that this is a very binary outcome. We could go public one day or you could lose all your money. I don't really see a lot in between there. I know are you okay with that? And if they're okay with that, great. And I find that just taking that time as an entrepreneur to be very crystalline and clear, it can be a little intimidating. But what you find is it's almost cathartic for the investors and the board members. And it just removes all these like, oh, I thought you meant that, but I get now that you meant that. Everyone on the board's aligned around that. They all know that. Yeah. That's rare. And that's quite impressive. So being a recovering entrepreneur myself, every business goes through major pivots, evolution and change along the way. If you have to see anyone that said, here's my idea. It came out the other end exactly the same way, right? So what were some of the really customer insights that helped shape your current service model? That's kind of part one. And then two, the elusive milestone of like getting a product market fit is really challenging. So I have to hear your thoughts on like what you learned, what that journey was, what changes or pivots you had to make. And then ultimately, how you got into that really important milestone being able to raise the necessary capital scale or getting a product market fit. Yeah, a lot in there. I'll try to hit them all quick. Those are amazing. That is the hardest part. The milestones are so hard. Like no one's written this down. Mark and Jason Scott is famous blog posts and it's awesome. I've read that thing like 500 times. It's like, it doesn't actually say what product, but it looks like that. Right. It'd be really helpful to know. It looks good on the article. It looks great in the article. And you know you need it. And you do need it. Oh, look, I am a big fan of hologram. If I learned anything going through YC, like, you know, I feel like it's a PG's right more than he's wrong, you know, and it's makes something people want. Right. And so I do think that is like that is why that YC shirts has that is because it's true. This is what all businesses are ultimately about. So for us, the pivots came early, right. So I shared this idea of putting a coach on the phone. Eddie and I made a huge mistake and I'll take credit for it. We thought our way out of that idea. So that's the business now. So for a year and a half to be we pivoted into what looked like in Excel, a better business model with better margins because putting a coach on a phone does not sound like a very lucrative business at all. Turns out we were wrong. But at the time we're like, that's not well, what could your margin can't be 90%. We better do like a broad based consumer play and then upsell you into it. So we built what I joke with our employees is maybe the worst app ever built. It was dual lingo for life skills. And it was terribly unengaging. The first this was from Eddie's NBA. The first module was conflict negotiation. So you literally could do dual lingo for battena. Be like, what is my battena? Drag and drop. No one used it. We didn't like it. No one liked it. But like an Excel, it looked like an amazing business. And so we actually pivoted out of that when we ran out of our like kind of initial capital that we had put into business ourselves. And we're like, we have nothing. Oh my gosh, our whole business just fell apart. 18 months, I pitched like 70 VCs got no yeses. They were smart enough not to invest in that. And then it was like, what can we do? I guess maybe we should go back to this one crazy idea I had a year and a half ago and just like put coaches on Google hangouts and see if people will like test message them and talk to them. And we were using a sauna to do the homework at the time. We didn't even, we couldn't even my code the thing. And so it was like, I hadn't touched code in like a decade at that point. I was like, I can fire a PHP. Man, I think this is just going to be faster, string a bunch of stuff together and have where I am build a landing page. And so then we were doing direct to prosumer, I would say it was called. So the first pivot was out of an Excel model into like really our gut was what we wanted. And that's a good for your first heuristic. It like you don't have a strong sense of what the market wants. Like, do you even want to use this? And if you don't, chances are your friends don't. Then what we found from our users one, the first early insights was we did user interviews. We only had like 25 users in the first couple of weeks. We do user interviews. We found that these people were going to their office using their better up coach at lunch in their car in the parking lot. And we were like, why? Why don't you just do it at your desk or like book a conference room? They're like, and I still remember this line in our data. It's like, well, it feels like I'm cheating. And in the interview, and he's like, what is that mean? Why are you cheating? It's like, my manager doesn't know I have this super power behind me called my coach, name there, propping me up, like helping me. And I just feel like if they did, they may think I'm not good at my job. And we were just like, whoa, like they would never, I haven't been an executive. I never would have thought that. So we, Ryan and Eddie and I had to like eat a lot of crow and we're like, is this the world's first business, I joke, where the user experience gets better by going enterprise instead of worst? Like maybe it would be free for people if their employer paid and their employer would sanction it. Whoa. How could that? So it was like an existential crisis for Ryan and I were like, no, no, no, we said we'd never be enterprise. Vow shall not. We can't do it. So we basically just had to go through a list of like what has to be true for us to do it. So that's one. All right. So to the product market fit, I mean, I think the early indications of product market fit is if you, is people are paying for something, right? Even if it's free and you're using your seeing conversion to pay for us, that came qualitative first, right? And just the depth of the relationships they were building, we would see people switch companies and offer their new company to have an author pay out a pocket. So that is where I think we really started to see product market fit. But ultimately, I do think product market fit really aligns at the user and the economic buyer. So if you're a beta, beta C, you actually need multiple layers of product market fit, which I don't think we talk about as much as the value. You need economic buyer product market fit, which is easier. Are people paying for it in our they renewing? But you also need user product market fit or you're doing shelf wear. So I'd say we achieve user product market fit. We knew we had that from the consumer experiment we have done by the time we went to the enterprise because people were paying out their own pocket, their own friends, high NPS. But the thing we had to unlock that actually took a little longer was the economic product market fit. What does the economic buyer need from a feature set here that is not just inherent in what the end user is getting that makes that really tight product market fit too? Yeah, that's awesome. So funny, Ethan Brown from Beyond Meet last week on the show and the two of you, I know Steve Blanks will watch you this. He's going to be doing cartwheels like to spend time with the customers yourself, not sending a surrogate out there, but working to see and I would have never guessed that either that they would literally use this product in their car. I wouldn't have guessed that. But spending that time with them and going through and iterating on that, look at the insights that you gave from that. That was incredible. All right. We still use those insights today. It's crazy. I mean, Eddie and I were coaches. Actually, we used some Stanford on the coaching. The R-Buckle Fellow too. Like, that's how much we were. No, no, no, we want to be the coaches for some of these people. We want to touch every aspect of this experience and figure out what's popping and what's not popping. Yeah. Let's try to think about that. I remember when I first went to solar, say they didn't have nothing about the solar industry. And I did every job, right? I was like, you've revenue officer. I worked on a home depot. I learned how to sell the product over the phone. I learned how to sell the product in the living room because you want to find where the problems are and you want to understand what the customer is coming from. It's hard to do that by reading a report or an email without experiencing that yourself. So that's pretty impressive. All right. We're getting down to almost the Q&A section, a couple of quick other questions. So as I said, I was a little bit stalking on you. One of the more interesting things that I read was that I remember you talked about when you worked at social cast. You got bought by VMware and you talked about how the integration was super stressful. I think you said your blood pressure went up like 40 points and. Yeah, it was something crazy like that. I'm growth equates to long hours and stress typically and unhealthy lifestyle. So how do you reconcile this growth with a more healthy lifestyle? Because that's like that's the unicorn right there, right? Yeah. I mean, it's a constant. I wouldn't say struggle. I mean, I think you can develop skills. I've gotten better at it. But I really do think with entrepreneurship, the best mental model I've come across is, I mean, it's Olympic athletes or elite performers. I mean, it's like Navy SEALs, whatever you want to use, right? It's like that is the equivalent of the game where I'm in business is it is about elite performance. And when you study elite performers, what you find is that stress is okay if it's an episodic period and it's well managed, right? And so stress is not universally bad. In fact, we do really well as humans under short bursts of stress. We may achieve things we normally would not have achieved. It's really about periods of recovery. And I think that's what we don't talk about enough is you are actually pretty resilient and durable. And if you're an entrepreneur, you probably selected into that because you're maybe a adrenaline junkies or whatever it may be, right? But what you can't avoid and when you look at and we've been fortunate to work with the sports psychologists from the Navy SEALs, some of the sports teams, you know, Olympians, when you look at these folks, what you find is recovery is equally as important and under talked about in business. You know, they are not ashamed. A SEAL is not ashamed to tell you that like I'm not mission fit on this mission. You know, I'm not in the right headspace and I don't want to jeopardize these people, right? They have a protocol for that. They don't look down on them. There's no machis, no, ah, tell me, you know, they may feel bad, but like they are like, this is the life or death. I'm not going to go on a mission and jeopardize the integrity of the mission, which could be my best friend's life because, you know, something I'm not managing or something's going on in my personal life. There's no shame in that, right? But in business, we don't have that. For some reason, business is the only and neat endeavor that I found where we are A, expected to always perform and never practice. Most elite sports practice 90% of the time and perform 10% or less. And B, if you need help and support, you're worse at the job than in any other elite endeavor where the better you are, the more help and support you need, right? Like LeBron James has more coaches than any high school basketball player you've ever met, right? Do you say that little little little John LeBron's getting propped up by all these coaches. If you didn't have the coaches, you wouldn't do it. No, you say like, he has so much potential. It takes seven people and a million dollars a year to spend on his body to realize that. That's crazy, right? But we haven't made that map in business. And so my encouragement to entrepreneurs is like, you're starting a new business. Make the map. Just be on a shame about it. Build recovery in. That's what we do within our work. Build that dialogue and discipline, you know? We had a conversation today as a leadership team. Should we mandate people take time off through the end of the year? And where we came out, we have a lot of scientists in the team. And it's like, that would be kind of silly because that wouldn't help everyone. We should encourage them so they feel free to do it. But understand that, no, some people actually may be happier right now being at work than being on vacation two feet away under sofa, right? And so I think this concept of recovery and structure of recovery is way underleveraged by CEOs and corporate leaders. And how do you build buffer zones and times of recovery? And that's what we've been trying to do a better up. Yeah, I mean, talking to you just seems like such a no brainer. I know in my life, and I've always, I'm a type A person. I want to be the best at whatever I do. And I wrestled in college. And I remember I wanted to learn MMA and I did a ton of research and found, you know, four time UFC World Champion and trained under his tutelage. And, you know, for a while, I was just absolutely, I loved golf and was terrible at it. You could keep practicing and trying. And you're not going to get that much better till I found a great coach, right? And it's funny, you give those really great analogies how you excel in these areas of your life. But yet on the business side, it's been wide open. It's been crickets over there. So I love it. Okay. Last question. We got a bunch of students' questions queuing up. But, so how's COVID-19 impacted your business? Yeah. I mean, I think for us right now, we're, you know, COVID-19 is obviously terrible worldwide. We have been fortunate, I think, in seeing net positive impacts. But it's net positive, right? For sure, you know, we do a lot of work in industries like hospitality and retail. Obviously, you see slowing there, right? As people are furloughing massive amounts of their employees. But we've also seen, you know, in general, the water level on people wanting virtual support and care, increasing people moving learning experiences to be all virtual. So I think we have been very, you know, fortuitously situated and positioned in the COVID world. And we've really been just viewing it as an invitation and opportunity to do more good in the world. We were really proud that we recently started donating free coaching to frontline healthcare workers. So we've been giving access to hundreds of thousands of healthcare workers in New York and across the country access to coaching so they can take care of themselves. As they're taking care of, you know, the most important people in America right now. So that's for us, I think, just been a huge lift. We've seen the lift in the business. That's great. But I think more importantly, we're seeing inside of this virus moment and economic moment, a huge humanitarian moment to really bridge the gap and reach out to people. So for us, I think it's really, and I even hesitate to say this, but take this in the right spirit. It's been a blessing in disguise. I think on just helping more people realize that the stuff that's most important in life is not what's at my office. It's the kids sitting next to me. And I want to be present for that. I want to be focused on that. And having a coach, having someone to help me can make a huge difference in how I show a little bit of life in that work. Yeah. You know, I love not only do you obviously talk to talk, but when you can really walk the walk and is you know, character emerges during difficult times. And for your organization, this step up for these healthcare workers who are putting their life on the line every day they show up and dealing with something that none of us have ever seen in our lifetime that has the potential of death and spread. That's pretty awesome. I'm going to sit my cap to you, sir. Okay. We got a bunch of student questions. So let's tackle some of those. First question is that at the most upvotes. So Alexi, what methods does your company employ to measure or quantify a mental state? And how do you quantitatively know if a user has improved mentally via the use of the platform? Yeah. Great question. So there's actually a lot of good work that's been done for probably three of these decades on measuring everything from you can it's crazy what you can measure. You can measure like someone's optimism levels and how they're changing resilience. So we have a measure. We call our whole person model, which we work with folks like Adam Grant, Martin Seligman on as well as our own team. We hired the head of research from a firm, which is the Society of Human Resource Management, the Chief Scientist from DDI, which is one of the big assessment companies related to psychographics. And they built what we I mean, I really believe it's probably the best measure of mindset skills and behaviors in the workplace. And it does it across domains of personal thriving as well as inspiring as a leader. And so you're able to assess that and you can assess that personally. You can also assess that in one another as peers in like a 360 type environment. So as you go through better up, that is being pulsed and assessed along the way. And then we run nationwide control studies. You aren't using better up. You can statistically pull out noise. And essentially that creates the richest mosaic of enterprise data that we know of. And our customers know of that really says, hey, look, these folks have been doing better up for four to six months, a year, two years maybe. And look at these increases and things you care about like stress is going down, resilience is going on. Their leadership is being rated higher by their teams and their reports, social thriving, their relationships and life. And so all these measures, and we prioritize the ones that we think are our valid, reliable, but also have robust evidence that they drive life and performance outcomes. So we'll see something like better up in under six months is one of the most efficacious interventions in the world on resilience. We actually double the average person's resilience using the kind of industry standard measures of resilience in six months. I mean, no, resilience is a fountainhead of everything from well-being to creativity, to great ideas. And so that is without getting into all the item scales, that's the high level of how we're measuring that. We have a team and we have, sometimes people like the only person doesn't have a PhD of better up, but we have, like, I think it's 50 behavioral scientists. I'm a kid you're not. It's crazy. The amount of behavioral scientists at the company. And so they are working on some facet of what we just talked about literally every day, fine tuning, adjusting, learning and iterating as we go. Yeah. Yeah. It's an impressive both high blend talent with data and evolve and just deliver incredible value that's measurable to these businesses and more importantly, these employees who are going to are excelling out of this environment. So, okay. Another interesting question here. How much did coding eventually help you? Well, I can't picture you coding much these days. Was that necessarily to get you where you are today? Many students have stampered struggle and don't know if that's truly what they want to do. Yeah. I mean, I still mentor some of these high school students. So they are always asking, what should we study? I always say for what it's worth, I think the two things, if you have an inclination that I would recommend everyone studies who wants to give into business is coding and accounting. Even if you never become an accountant and you never become a programmer, because both have taken what otherwise are very amorphous complex things and structure them into very tight, lean, auditable systems. And ultimately, as an entrepreneur, you're taking a pretty fuzzy amorphous idea and you're structuring it hopefully into a tight, audible business. Right? And so I think that type of thinking for me was the biggest gift of programming. And I'm a big believer having built product teams. I'll hire folks who are from only design backgrounds. Some folks won't do that. I find they don't. But there's a difference. I will say there is a difference where someone has had exposure and knows how to program. Even if they are not programming and someone who hasn't, in how they think even I find logically the tightness of those loops, how they think about exceptions, and just being able to visualize flows of information and almost like metaphysical checks and balances along the way. I find for me it's that cognition, the coding, and I think accounting in another way, maybe the organic chemistry would also do this. Really kind of inculcates in people that I think is the most powerful gift. Obviously, your programmer, you got to stay sharp on your codes and tax all that. So for me, as a CEO, you're often doing building blocks. They are kind of like very rudimentary assembly of like if else then or statements. And having done that more formally and programming, I find it's been a gift for me and bringing that into sometimes buzzier business spaces. Yeah, that's awesome. Well, it's funny because I'm going to date myself right now. I started out in a technical career. And my math to student, aptitude was good. We're hiring a number of people from MIT. And it's not MIT good. And being a type of engineer, I was getting really frustrated. And so my insight joke to my class, whether the mediocre programmers and make them product managers. But I had one twist on all your things. I agree with that. And I think that either if you focus on either product, right, if you can engineer or be product management, or the other great areas sales, right? Because companies need both things. You have to have great products. And you got people that can sell it, right? So accounting is a really great discipline as well too. So all right, we spoke of Adam Grant and Grant's book, Give and Take, Extol's the benefits of being a giver. Being a giver can lead to great success, but it can often overtax the giver, occupying not only their time, but also their emotional bandwidth. So how do you reconcile the value of being a giver with how taxing that approach can be? Yeah, I mean, I haven't read the book in years, but you're right. I think he actually finds that if you over give, it's like the least successful profile or something to that degree. He has a two by two matrix, right, of giving and taking and disagreeable and agreeable. And so the sweet spot for Adam having got to know him, you know, a decent amount is disagreeable givers, right? That means you're giving people what they need, whether or not they want it. You're speaking truth to them because you care for them, right? In Fred Kaufman's framework or Jeff Weiner from LinkedIn, conscious business, we'd say, you're being compassionate, even if it doesn't feel in the moment like you may be being nice, right? You actually are being kind. And so I think with giving it is that balance of, are you coming with their best intention at heart? But all you also understanding that you have a finite amount of resources, whether that's economic resources, whether that's time or whether that's psychological resources, such as focus and energy. And if you over give, you are barring against your future ability to give. And so just like giving money, if your bill gates, you need to be prudent and wise in how you give other things. And time is more valuable than money. Psychological energy, I think, is undervalued. We only have so many hours a day, we're truly going to be productive. And so we don't want to be selfish. We don't want to be able to, or take from people, or even be selfish. But there's a big difference between, I think, being regimented and organized and being really deliberate and taking a long-term view of the LTV you can give, versus dropping everything in the moment to just, you know, react. And I believe if I dain't in paraphrase his research, the people who are more structured and more deliberate and more prudent in how they gave were the most successful, because they achieved sustainability and balance in doing that. So that's how we think about it better. We literally use that in every employee orientation, that two by two, on disagreeable giving. This is where we want to be. And it may not taste good in the minute, moment, but you know what? Snicker bars taste great in the moment. Turns out they're not good for you long-term. So sometimes whose best-first long-term isn't what always feels right in the moment. So that type of internal regulation and discipline, and we would say psychologically, perspiration, the ability to think through the future steps, I think is a huge part of giving prudently and wisely. Yeah, I think that's a great way to look at that. All right, man. We got one final question here, fully wrap up. So Alex, if you could go back in time and talk to yourself before you created better up, what would you tell your past self? Oh, man, so many things. Okay. I think the biggest would be... And I want to... You're going to... It's not going to surprise you, but it's true. And so I want to bound it. Is it's like, especially early on, go with your gut. Don't exclusively go with your gut. But when you've had the data, and I think Jeff Bezos has said this better than I ever will, when there's 70% of the data and it's decisions, they don't need to be made, don't go without a self-file always. You know, look at the self-file, and go with your gut. We would have saved 18 months of my life, the company's life, had we just like stop thinking about margins obsessively and just made something people wanted, starting with us. So that, I think... And look, it all worked out. We learned a ton. You know, I wouldn't say I have ripperettes, but that would be a one big thing. The second thing I would give myself is, you know, your energy, your think of inspiration as you have a finite amount every day. You can put out of yourself into the world and into your team is perhaps, and I say this with no ego, I say this having learned from my coaches, humbly, the greatest asset a company has in its early form of years. And so people that drain you from that, things that are necessarily draining you from that, it doesn't matter if it's right or wrong, it doesn't matter if it's fair, it's not in your best interest or the long-term best interest of the company. And so being an advocate for your energy, being an advocate for where you are most optimized, does not mean you're not being a servant leader. It actually is the highest form of servant leader because you realize that like this ship needs a captain, and if I'm not dialed in, if I'm not focused, then we're rudderless. And so that relates to projects, people organizing what rules you're going to fire yourself from as a CEO as you build out your team, really be thinking about what energizes you and things that don't energize you. Hey, we all have to scoop poop sometimes. That's part of life, that's okay. But like at some point, you have to get that to someone who really specializes and cares deeply about that so you can focus on the things that you're uniquely good at. And I think trying to be a servant leader, and I kind of, I don't know what the word would be, and imprudently squandered a lot of time doing things that I probably wasn't best suited to do. There's probably someone who's better and would have enjoyed it more. And it just drained me then from doing the things where I am uniquely situated, where I could have brought more energy and more addition to them.
