 You are listening to the Draper Fisher-Jurvinson entrepreneurial thought-leader seminar, brought to you weekly by Stanford Technology Ventures program at Stanford University School of Engineering. So with no further ado, I'd like to introduce our guests for today. Before I do that, how many of you are on LinkedIn, please raise your hand. That's great share. And those of you who are not, if you're wireless, that's alright. You don't have to, if you're... They're at least a couple of people who are online in the room and they may be able to get you onto the site before the hour is over, if not, go home right after and get on. It's one of the most useful social networking sites on the planet. I'm only involved in one social networking site in LinkedIn as the one. So, but what about our guest? Reid Hoffman is the founder and he is the chairman and president of Products of LinkedIn. And those of you who have the hard copy version of the announcement for the day, see that his bio says a slightly different thing. And that is because Reid brought in his new CEO that he's going to bring into the firm to take it to the next level. He'll be staying with LinkedIn, but he has brought in a new executive by the name of Dan Nye. And so, it's been a very, very busy week and we're really glad that Reid has been able to spare the time to come and visit with us today despite all the things that are happening as he changes around his executive team at LinkedIn. In addition to the work there, he's had a very storied career. He's been at places like Apple. He's invested in virtually all of the interesting social networking startups that were founded over the course of the last decade. You can read faster than I can talk about that. So, let's welcome a warm welcome back to Stanford to an alumni of the school and one of our favorite folks out there in the valley. Reid Hoffman, come on back. So, I'm going to pace a little bit, but I guess that what content would be most interesting and useful. So, I will try to go through that in kind of 20, 25 minutes. Hopefully it will provoke interesting thoughts if it doesn't. My apologies and anything is okay for questions. I'm only going to talk a little bit about LinkedIn at the end, but again, any field is fine for questions. So, I'll start with some principles that I've learned about entrepreneurship. And actually, I'll do a slight bit of my narrative as a way of introducing this. I was an undergraduate here. I graduated in 1990. I went to Oxford University to get a master's degree in philosophy. It's a requirement for entrepreneurship. That's a joke. Because I thought I was going to be an academic. And what I realized about a year into the program at Oxford was that I actually wasn't interested in. I was more interested in being a public intellectual than I was a scholar. And what I mean by public intellectual is someone who helps us as individuals and as a society figure out both who we are currently and who we should be. And I also thought that was writing articles for the New York Review of Books and being a professor somewhere. And I realized that in order to be a professor, you had to be a scholar first, which meant you spent 15 years of your life writing books and articles that 50 people would read. And it was a little antithetical to the goal. So I decided I would become a business person. And I actually knew from the very beginning that I wanted to do software startups. I had been exposed to the net here. I hacked Unix scripts at the center for the study of language and information. And I thought that online would be a really interesting medium to go create businesses. And one of the pluses about creating businesses, my thinking at the time, not false but partial. Was you can weld it with a capital model because if you can actually create a sustainable profitable business, it theoretically lives forever. I mean, obviously markets change, conditions change, something eats it. Right? M and A gets acquired. But you actually have something that creates a force that makes change in the world. And so, but there were a whole bunch of things I learned when I shifted from academia to entrepreneurship that were not things that I ever imagined that you needed to learn when I was in school. And a little bit of what I'm going to be talking about in entrepreneurship is focused on that theme because I thought this audience might be interested in that. So starting with it, one of the things that one of the focuses to think about entrepreneurship is thinking of it as investing. And there basically, I think, really three types of investment strategies. There's there are sure bets and sure bets, you know, frequently you think you have a sure bet and you don't. But sure bets are you have some kind of edge. You have resources that you're unique on or you control. You have inside information. You have a privileged skill point. And so, you know, the only one who's allowed to invest that's not really applicable to entrepreneurship. I'm recognizing more people in the audience. Because usually entrepreneurship is in the high risk. So the second type is, you know, kind of low risk management. It's a portfolio diversification. Many of these people go by looking for a career. Right. So I go to law school, I go to business school. A lot of people join McKinsey. You know, management consulting. And by the way, one little side tip. I have found that consulting backgrounds and MBAs are negative predictors for successful entrepreneurship. Right. So it's not 100% negative. There are successful entrepreneurs with both of those elements in the background. But usually the things that attract people to that are the low risk category. It's like, oh, I get in a Stanford. And I got Stanford GSB on my background. I've met all these people. It's a way of preparing for the future. Well, it's not taking a risk. It's not going, I see something that other people don't see. And I'm going to one of the metaphors that I frequently use for entrepreneurship. I'm going to jump off the cliff and assemble the plane on the way down. Right. And frequently you find that you've left key elements out like the propeller or the engine. Right. And the end result is you hit the ground. Right. Now, you know, a path that's like, oh, I'm going to go to McKinsey, which is a really, like, really smart people. It's an interesting job and everything else. Well, it's safe. Right. It's a salary. Right. It's a proven path. You compete with a lot of people. You get there. So one of the things that I think what entrepreneurship is is actually the third style of investing, which is accurate contrarian theory. So you want to pick something that is not what everyone else thinks. Right. If everyone else thinks it, it's almost actually in fact impossible to do it in any, any interesting way. So, for example, if you're starting a generic photo sharing site right now on the web, you are out of your mind. Right now, maybe there's some kind of unique edge, something, but it can't be, oh, mine has music. You know, it's got to be something that's actually in fact pretty unique. And if you really want to get it to discontinuous value, it's got to be something contrarian. It's got to be something which is not packed with lots of other people. You have to have a chance to get the run wet, you know, to get off the ground to assemble the plane first if you want to use the metaphor. Another metaphor I use is scuba diving. Because it, because one of the things that's really important, understand about entrepreneurial ventures is you're, you're basically walking dead. So if you think about it when you're underwater with an air tank, the air will run out. If you do not get back to the service, you're dead. Right. So in entrepreneurship, you're trying to figure out which way is the surface and how much oxygen do I have before I get there financing, additional oxygen. So it's not success to raise money. Money, it only gives you a longer runway. Matter of fact, and it makes the hurdle at the end higher. You raise $50 million. You now have to make a really good exit. Right. It's not really a success metric. It's really funny because I sometimes listen to someone, entrepreneurs talk about, well, you want to hear about how successful I've been. I raised $100 million. Okay. Right. Raising money is only a step that enables you to try to be successful. It gives you enough runway. And if you raise a lot of money, then that runway, then the bar at the end is much higher. So, so here's some key things I think to remember. These are kind of principles about entrepreneurship that I've learned. And I'll try to put them as I remember them in the kind of the why it was surprising to me when I moved from academia and in the business. So first, work as if you're going to succeed. Right. One of the things about entrepreneurs is, is you're a little crazy because you're taking this blank thing and you're thinking, oh, I can, I can see the thing I can build. Right. It's always a lot more work and a lot harder than you think. And if you look at statistics, most entrepreneurial ventures fail. Right. So depending on which stats you look at, it's somewhere between 10 and 30% on the success range. That's in a, there was a happy exit that isn't crater at the, you know, that isn't a little smoking ruin. So you work as if you're going to succeed because you have to have that kind of like visualize it, but plan on the fact that you might actually fail. Right. And think about the fact that you be paranoid about the fact that you may be failing. So for example, one of the lessons that was very contrary for me between my academic training, right. And my business training is, you want to get to your failure points and measure them as early as you can. Because in fact, it's like, oh, I'll do all this stuff to prep because I really don't want to fail. So I'll do this piece of work first and that piece of work and that piece of work and this piece of work. But if this is your test failure point and this point is say three years out and you wait for three years to measure that and you could have measured it in year one, you could have actually known that you were going to fail and have the extra few years to do something else. Right. So get to that point as soon as you can and do not maximize getting over the hurdle. Everyone has a fear of failure. They have a fear of public embarrassment. Right. And there's some rationale to that. We all have brands. Those brands affect who invest in us, who works with us, etc. You have to manage that in some intelligent way. And in fact, I see tons of people basically spend years on failed ideas because they don't actually drive it to they just think, well, if I just get everything right, it will work. And you really have to be hard-nosed about what's the central test and if it fails that test, what do I think about it? So, so work as you're going to succeed, but plan on the contingency and things of failing. Time matters. Frequently, it's one of the things that's unfortunately true is that there's a market readiness to win an idea as good. So let's take one of the recent phenomena, YouTube. Obviously, YouTube had one of the most spectacular beginning growth and exits for an entrepreneur in a very compressed time period. Think about it. My space didn't exist. Or for PayPal, the thing I did earlier, if eBay didn't exist. If those things weren't there, they could not have been the successes that they were. And what's more, before YouTube, there had been at least 30 to 40 video startups I knew about over the last four years, previous to that. Well, and so a lot of people said, well, I had an idea that was like that yet. And it's like yes, you did. And some of it is just luck. This is the right time. This is the right place. Now, Chatton Steve did a great job. They copped the wave, they surfed it, they surfed it really well. They did a great job with it. But part of when you look at the lessons of this, sometimes you have to count on the fact that sometimes you're going to be lucky and sometimes you're not. And if your time cycles are really, really long, the number of times that you have to have the luck of catching a wave is small. So you want to get to measuring whether or not your idea works or not as early as you can. It's about controlled risk, which means neither take tons and tons of risk and take no risk. If you think you're taking no risk, well, either you're not doing anything, or you're deluding yourself. Anything that's new involves some amount of risk. Now, the whole point about controlled risk is people then say, oh, it's risky. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to work on artificial intelligence and all creative device that's advancing science. Well, it's risky. Who knows who can do it? Well, the answer is that won't be happening anytime soon. Contrary to some AI predictions from some number of years ago. But focus on like, if it's if this one risk or these two risks or hopefully no more than three break my way, then I've got something really valuable. Right. And that thing can really work. And in particular, actually, this was this, this leads to another of things that was a big insight for me. Hopefully, maybe this is I was stupid. In business, what the problem you're trying to solve is take the easiest, simplest problem that's valuable. You're not trying to prove how smart you are. You're not trying to prove how hard of a problem you can solve. Right. Those are academic things because the way that you were awarded here by like publishing a great paper or having a great essay or something else is you took an intellectually very difficult problem and you displayed your mastery of it, being able to solve that problem with pure brain power. Business is about the simplest possible problem that you can actually get scalable that works and and goes, you know, big. So, for example, YouTube, right, simple publishing a video. Right. It's not to say that sometimes, by the way, there isn't a tremendous amount of work underneath it, but it's not like a grand master plan. So, I guess I'll kind of go through quickly these kind of things get to a little bit of the narrative, which will be interesting. But what's the fundamental strategy of a startup? People frequently think it's product strategy. It's like I have a great idea for a photo sharing site, a video site, a blogging site, a way of doing a new search, a way of preventing spam, a way of delivering email, whatever it is. I'm a consumer internet guy, so there's lots of other intropreneurial exists, but all my examples of being that arena. It's actually not product strategy and it's not sales strategy. It's financing strategy. It's strategy relative to capital markets. I'll go in a little bit more depth than this when I indicate why my first startup had problems. And it was a lack of knowledge that financing strategy is central. I'll come back to the other principles as we're doing the narrative. So, I left Oxford and I decided to come back and do startups. So, I actually networked my way to a couple of VCs and they said, that's interesting, what's your work experience? I was like, well, I've interned at Xerox Park and I've interned at AstroRi International and I interned at CSLI and I said, no, no, no, what's your work experience? Have you ever worked? You've done something? And I was like, oh, and what they were saying is, look, you want to do development software, prove that you've professionally developed software for. You have the skills because there's basically three skill types that are part of a founding team. It's you're the technologist, you can build it. You're the product person, you know what it is you're delivering your customer and all that, and you're a general manager. Now, it's actually usually, the product is usually in the technologist or in the general manager. They're usually, they're relatively rare that there's a unique distinct class in the founder for just the product person. It happens sometimes, but it's usually either technologists or general manager, one of whom owns a product vision. And so they were saying, well, which one of you are you a general manager? Clearly not, you have had no experience with business, you've just come to us with a set of academic degrees. And you're not a technologist because you're not going to sit in the closet and, you know, and code for 24 hours a day and make the thing happen. So go get a job, learn how to do software development and come back as one of these two with product experience. So, Apple, computer, eWorld, people of mayor may not even remember it. It was a licensee available. It all kinds of crazy, crazy things, although there's, there's all kinds of funny things about the history of eWorld. Then the Fujitsu, because Apple was my first, like, learn how to ship software. Fujitsu was general management. And then I started my first company, social net. And this was August 1997. And there were a couple of things that I, there were, there were, say, three key lessons at social, social net basically returned its capital to its investors, but didn't actually do very well. And there were three key problems. The first one was, as I mentioned, was financing strategy is central. So in 1997 to 1998, and, you know, we raised our second round in late 1998. All of our competitors were going to the market and saying, we're going to build these free websites. They're going to have a whole world on them. And you should give us $40 million to go do that. We were going to the market saying, well, we think subscription dating is one of the real places where you can make money on the internet. And you should give us $5 million, because we're going to kind of just, you know, make a subscription web service and make it happen. And in our business model, we think is really sound. And the business model is sound, if you look at match.com and e-harmony and a bunch of other things now. But the problem was it was a wrong strategy at the time. Strategy at the time was everyone else was raising $40, $50 million and was going and advertising and buying deals and everything else that money. And we were sitting here trying to make our little business model work, which in that financing climate was a dumb strategy. Your strategy has to be reflect what your finance ability is. And one error, our error, which is an unusual one, is very frothy capital markets. All your competitors are going to be well capitalized. And if you under capitalize, well, your competitors, you're screwed. The other one, of course, is can you actually raise money for this at all? Because if you can't raise money for it, and you're not attentive to what the financing market looks like for what you're doing, then you may also die because you have inadequate financing. The second thing I learned, and this is a very basic on consumer internet, is it's frequently set of retail that there are three words, location, location, location. And consumer internet, it's distribution, distribution, distribution. And, as a matter of fact, one of the ways that I'm talking to on panels and stuff about entrepreneurship and consumer internet is value of what you've built without distribution, approximate value zero. If you do not get distribution, technologies not valuable, teams not valuable, doesn't matter. If you haven't acquired a whole bunch of users through generally natural organic means, virality is one, most people use the word not knowing what it means. Viral distribution is one, there are other forms of distribution that are natural organic that work. Then your value is zero. And we had, when I didn't had done social net, I hadn't realized, because when you work at Apple and Fujitsu, you work at these places which have big channels of customers already. I hadn't realized that distribution strategy was central. And without this, that's the very first thing you worry about, especially in consumer internet. And you know, it's great that up. And then the final thing was the importance of, in software development, I break skill sets into three groups. Version zero to version one, version one to version one, version one, version one to version two. Those are three different games. They're played differently. They have skills differently. You measure your success differently. When you're doing a entrepreneurship, you're doing the V zero to V one. And the game is very different. So like, say, for example, you go work at IBM, you get software experience for three years, but does not teach you how to do V zero to V one. That's one of the things to focus on learning. So then while I was doing social net friend of mine, who was also I've met here as an undergraduate Stanford Peter Teal, said, hey, we got this cool new idea. Can you come join us? And a cool new idea was encryption on mobile phones. I said, it's a terrible idea. It's never going to work. That's right. And one of the mistakes he was making at the time, which I had already learned early was, well, we saw this really hard problem. It's really hard to do encryption on mobile phones. It's a really valuable thing. It's like, yeah, but there's no business model who's going to use it. But Peter's a really good friend of mine. So I agreed to join the board and help him out. And that morphed into PayPal because it started encryption on mobile phones. And it was like, OK, no one's going to build on your encryption platform. So, OK, we'll do cash and mobile phones. OK, so what are you, you know, can you get to market soon with that? Remember time was the earlier principle. Well, we get to market soon with palm pilots. So we're going to have palm pilots. And you're like, OK, what's your use case? Well, your use case is splitting the dinner tab at restaurants. I'm like, all right, well, how many people at all of these restaurants all have palm pilots? Right? Just put them up. Oh, very few users. OK, well, we can sync that with email. That's how the email payment idea started. Like, oh, actually email payment sounds interesting. Let's go do that. Now, even then, by the way, this is still a very crazy idea because none of us had any banking experience. And so we launched this thing and people said, well, what do you do by chargebacks? We're like, what are chargebacks? Right? Well, are you a bank? What makes you a bank? What makes something a bank versus not a bank? Can we just say we're not a bank? Right? And actually, it's pretty complex. So you say, OK, what makes a bank? There's one sentence that says bank accepts deposits. Well, OK, and if you actually think about that, it gets complicated. You buy a phone card. Is that accepting deposits? It's a phone company bank. Right? It actually gets pretty pretty hairy when you do that. One of the central things we ended up solving was figuring out how to say we're in fact not a bank in a way that at least the federal government agreed with us. And then we also had to get all 50 states to agree with us because each state has its own individual banking regulations. But actually, one of the lessons that PayPal was. Solve your problems in order. So, for example, earlier thing that I said was get to testing your hypothesis as soon as you can. But don't try to solve all your problems at once. If you try to do that, you'll fail. Right? It's kind of like saying, I'm going to build a house by simultaneously laying the foundations, putting in the plumbing, putting up a wall, putting in the same, I'm going to do a wall at the same time. Like, terrible idea for construction. Now, you want to get to the biggest risks as soon as you can because if actually in fact that big risk out here kills everything else, then you've done all that work and then this fails. So you want to try to get the solving on a student's can. But sometimes you have to do this edifice. You have to do this first. That's fine. So for us it was, well, can we get demand going? Right? And at PayPal, we discovered this really valuable thing called eBay. And all these people were paying each other with checks. Which is a terrible way to do commerce. Right? And there were a whole bunch of sophisticated smart moves that were made to penetrate that market. But then it started going, now we can solve the banking problem. Right? And actually solving the banking problem was against hostile approaches because banks didn't want us to succeed. So banks and other competitors would go up to regulators and say, look at these evil people. PayPal, they're doing illegal banking. You should go get them. Right? And so you'd have regulators. Right? And so you'd have regulators that call us that would say things like, well, why are you soliciting for deposits illegally on eBay? You know, like soliciting for deposits? Don't think we're doing that. Here, we'll come talk to you. So, um, so I guess, but one of the things that was also a valuable lesson at PayPal, because there was a really crazy ride because you've got visa and mastercard issues, you've got banking issues, you've got your principal market is eBay, we've actually solved that by selling the eBay. I presume that's not news to anybody that's at least five years old. But one of the things that is actually a central thing about entrepreneurship is thinking about competition. Ideally, you have no competition. I actually prefer to invest in things and to do things where there in fact isn't anybody who is really truly competition because it gives you the freedom. You're right about your two or three, maybe one hypotheses to make the thing go to expand and take the territory and set up here like this is my my market. Before competition starts now. Second best is slothful, decadent, stupid competition. Right? And the flip side of the banking regulation, which was a bear a nastiness for us to get through is banks. You can compete with them without being a bank are great to compete against because banks by definition right are slothful and very slow and terrible competitors. Now part of that is because of the structure how they work. So like one of the things that we almost did during PayPal is part of the reason we merged with a company called x.com is we thought, oh, okay, actually being a bank might be a good business model. Let's go become a bank. And so we started on that road. And then we realized what is new product launch at bank banking institutions look like. Well, basically it works like this. You propose your new product to the regulators and you give them 12 months to digest it before you launch before you start building it launching it. 12 months think about internet time. Right. 12 months is a complete product cycle where the whole world changes on the internet in a year. Banks are great to compete against because by definition the way that they all operate is for them to launch a product they got to go talk to these people called regulators who do not care about upside they care about risk only they care about F.D.I.C. insurance. They're great to compete against. So when you're looking at where to where to innovate innovating either against no competitors. That's good or against bad competitors. Right. That's almost as good not quite but almost. Now, if you're going up against an aggressive smart competitor who is already in the market. You've either got to be really sure about what you're doing or kind of fool hardy or don't really care if it all blows up. Right. So in 2002, so the company eBay started LinkedIn. I also did a couple of things that did some angel investing. It's all my profile on LinkedIn. People want to see it but flicker Facebook with key add to things like that and join some boards. Six part blogging. One of the things I think about the internet is what happens when everyone becomes a publisher. LinkedIn is partially based on this theory. I'll mention that in a bit. Also Firefox, which I think is a really interesting one of the things I like really like about the internet is kind of power to the people empower every individual. One of the things PayPal is doing. Everyone can become a merchant. So, so talk a little bit about LinkedIn's design for entrepreneurs and then open for questions. I think it would be reasonable. So there were basically three core ideas in LinkedIn. So you think, all right, everyone's going to become a publisher. What does that mean? Well, some people are going to blog. Some people are going to photo share. Some people are going to share videos. All that's good. There are good businesses on that. I've invested in some of them on the boards of some. But I think one of the things that meant professional is every professional is going to have a professional profile out to the web. It makes economic and rational sense. Because who knows what might find me. If I'm looking for a job, a job may find me. If I'm an investor and looking for investment, a good investment may find me. And my, say, for example, an expert's on online payments and a consulting gig finds me. That might be interesting too. Or a board of directors gig or board of advisors gig. So profile is one of, that was one of the ideas. And then the other idea is, well, what's the key glued separate signal from noise? Because of course with my profile, you know, like, for example, when I signed up with rise in 2001. And I was like, well, what I've been in PayPal, I've got a long list of, I've got the next PayPal idea. Come meet with me. I'm like, okay. How do you sort between the people who are crazy? The people who are well meaning, but fundamentally don't know what they're talking about. And the people that actually, in fact, as an investor, you would want to talk to. And the answer in part was trusted web relationships. Right. So the way that actually all professionals work, everyone who actually, in fact, has assets that they can deploy, say, example, a job at Google, an investment. That's the thing. They use personal referral. Right. If you come, for example, walking up to me and saying, hey, look at my business in this venue is a very bad way to reach me. Yes, where it's Stanford, right? Stanford's a smart, smart place. But I don't know how to start that out from the other 15 approaches I have this week. And I'm not even a professional investor. I have a day job. It's called LinkedIn. The best way to reach me or any other investor is come in through someone that goes, who will say, this person rocks. They've got a great idea. They're sensible. They're smart. It's worth your time to take 30 to 60 minutes of which I have personally a maximum of three of those slots a week. Because I normally do this on Sundays. Right. And it's time for me, time away from my wife. But for example, if I'm a venture capitalist, I get maybe 50 to 100 business plans minimum per week, probably 300 to 400. They show up through the mail. And they get dumped in my lobby. Right. I don't look at any of those. Right. I don't know. I don't know. I'll love the sea who spends any time looking at those whatsoever. Sometimes you have associates. You say, hey, you're not busy. Go read those things. See if there's anything interesting. I'm particularly interested in online gaming. Is there anything on that there? You know, that sort of thing. Best way is to get a introduction. Because even if, for example, your ideas half baked, if someone that an investor, for example, trust says, pay attention to this one. They're smart. Pay attention. Because one investment strategy is investing people. Right. There's a whole line of Silicon Valley investing that I invest in people. And that's that's what I do. So so LinkedIn was profile network of trust for searching for reaching and for filtering out from being reached. And then the applications built on top of it. So, for example, we recently launched LinkedIn answers. And actually for most entrepreneurs stuff, if you're not paying attention or using LinkedIn answers, you are a technologically out of date. Basically, a lot of the questions that you would have about customers, markets, that kind of stuff, you can go, if you have a network built on LinkedIn, you can go ask them here and you will be stunned at the quality of answers that you can get. And I'm not normally that salesy, but I'm just kind of talking the truth. So I'll do one little slant on one way of crisply understanding LinkedIn and then a couple things about how I believe actually all careers in entrepreneur element are open for questions. So the slant is one specific vertical way of thinking about LinkedIn is its resume version two. Resume version one technology is a list of assertions on a text document printed or electronic that I send you privately between you and me. There's all kinds of problems with this. There is the egregious things such as people lying, right, like I have a degree from Stanford when I don't, I worked at Apple when I didn't, right, that's the real thing. To what is this normal kind of gray line between being adequately salesy because you want to, it's a sales document, you're selling yourself and a little over the lot. Like, oh, I actually wasn't the team manager. I was, I was on the team. We didn't actually sell, you know, $5 million, at least $1 million, this tends to get exaggerated a lot on resumes. Well, so in resume version two, you have a resume that can be potentially network validated because it's can be validated by the people that you work with bosses, co-workers, so worth saying yes, I've done that. And additional is additional metadata like the person's really sharp or the person's really organized, the person always gets done what they say they'll get done or whatever. And in part of that network environment, it becomes very easy to check someone out. So, for example, one of my hopes with that LinkedIn is not only were reference checking be done by a hiring manager for someone that they're hiring or an investor on a prospective investment, but also the reverse. You can reference check your prospective manager. Do I want to work for this person? Because, by the way, your manager, if you get a job, will have a huge amount more to do with your happiness, probably, than even your spouse. You're there for 48, 50 hours during the week, and it can be pretty miserable. Likewise, for an investor. If you chose the wrong investor, that can be a... One of the things I said about venture investing frequently is it's like getting married on a dinner and two PowerPoint pitches. Because now all of a sudden, you're economically tied at the hip in a really tight way through what is almost universally a stressful experience. Because startups always go through something I call a value of shadow. There's always some period where you're going, I thought this was a good idea. Why was that? So, for example, a PayPal was in August 2000. We burned $12 million in one month without a dime of revenue. The cost line was escalating and we were going to be a big mushroom cloud in February. Why did we think this is a good idea? But, you know, it worked. So, here's the last bit. I think entrepreneurship is very important because in fact, I think that every modern career is heading towards entrepreneurship. The I work at one company for the rest of my life, IBM, whatever, is gone. It's even gone in Japan. Basically, it's still the kind of 35, 40-year-old, they're still kind of working at one company for Jitsu for whatever, for the rest of their career. But amongst the 20-somethings and the early 30-somethings, it's even changing there. So, that means that in fact, you were becoming a small business and you're becoming someone who would entrepreneur even if your elected career path is, I work for this company and then I work for this company and then I work for this company. Because you're transferring jobs, you know, jobs to heal them. And you have all the issues that a small business or entrepreneur cares about. The brand of you, what you do, that's the way that's the way that's going to work. And so, one of the things that I actually think is more important is actually in beginning to think that the skills learned from entrepreneurship are applicable to any career path. That's it. Absolutely. I'll interpret them too. Oh, Mark? You started off an entrepreneurship and then also later moved to investing. Does that imply that being successful entrepreneur makes it easier to be a successful investor? Not always. Oh, yes, thank you. Does success and all things you learn from entrepreneurship lead to the right principles and investing? And the answer is, if you do it well, it helps a lot, but a lot of people do it poorly. And part of that is because many entrepreneurs actually start with a gem of an idea. Like I've got this idea, like it's a new search engine or it's a way of preventing spam getting in my outlook. And that's what motivated me. And I learned about like even if I made it successful, I learned a bunch of operational techniques and how to steer this boat through the, you know, the minefield. But that's not the same thing as choosing an investment law. I'll give you an example of a principle that I've learned that I tell a lot of my venture friends. Investors frequently make the following mistake. They go, oh, I were involved with that idea. Then that could be successful. So I'm going to invest in that. As an investor, you have, you can help an idea. You can help a team. But fundamentally, you're making bad investments. If you don't make an investment based on the fact that if I walk away tomorrow, I'll give you the check. And I disappear. Is it a good investment? Because if the answer to that question is no, you should not make the investment. Because there's a limited amount. I mean, what if the example, you know, you're wrong about your ideas or the interface doesn't work or. I mean, this like, for example, a classic VC mistake. And this is one of the things I sometimes give VCs lectures about how to do boards. As a board member, you show up and you maybe put two hours of work a week into a company. Maybe three. You think about it. Get some data. If you're lecturing the management team that's working there 70, 80 hours a week on like basic ideas in your board meeting, you've got one of two problems. Either your management team is really moronic. Right. And you should get rid of them tomorrow. Or you've got a problem with your own ego, right, which is obviously they would have considered some of these ideas. Right. So part of the whole thing is the investing stance can learn the right things from entrepreneurship. But it's a bunch of different skills, which being a successful entrepreneur can dilute you to how to do that successfully. Other questions. So my question is, so when you first built LinkedIn, right, sort of have the networks, I mean, I'm sorry, you have to like the website, but you probably have everything you use. Right. So what are some key to this you talk to grow that user base from zero to power. So, yes, thank you. Good to remember. So the question was, you certainly didn't. We turned the lights on on LinkedIn on the internet May 5, 2003. How is that that becomes 9 million people later? And especially how are the first set in there? And how does the distribution end up going given the distribution is key. Well, one thing is, again, I was mentioning market timing and and and fortune. One of the reasons why I started LinkedIn almost immediately after I left PayPal eBay for selling PayPal to eBay was that I actually thought it was a great time for starting consumer and companies. And the ability the bar was lowered to make certain kinds of distribution engines work. So, for example, one of the reasons Forenster took off in 2003 was because it was kind of the only thing interesting going on. I mean, basically the vent Forenster viral engine was come see the party. Right. Like this big social network, everyone's connected and you can see their pictures and you didn't realize you were three degrees away from these people talking about burning man and having drugs and sex in the desert and these other people being hell's angel bikers and always in this cool. Right. Well, LinkedIn was will check out this new thing for professionals. And so in fact, even if none of the compared the there were a bunch of competitors that we more or less left in the dust. Even if none of the competitors is sitting everything else, it was nothing on the professional sphere starting LinkedIn the day would be really hard the way we did it because just another site that said, hey, invite people and have them check it out today is hard because now all the same. And all the other sites are going, hey, invite all your friends, which works a lot well for high school students and college students because those guys tend to like invite all their friends, lots of things. But does not work for professionals very well. And so we just basically, and there's a bunch of science as well as art. I mean, there were a bunch of techniques about how to have people psychologically incentive to send invitations to make it easier from the do so. And so that's the one thing that we did a bunch of times when we launched with an active x component that allowed you to just hit, you know, say, yes, please upload my outlook and then the outlook would be uploaded. You know, those are so there's a whole bunch of techniques as well, but it's a combination of kind of human psychological motivation in kind of psycho ecosystems, psychological ecosystems and economic environments and technical tricks for doing it. So, we're profitable. Oh, yes, thank you. Sorry. What is the revenue model for LinkedIn? Well, one of the things that I actually believe is true of most successful Internet products is that you have to have a substantial free component. So there was a robust free account on LinkedIn and what's more, we don't want anyone thinking that, oh, my God, something that I have to pay for this. So we actually hide most of the things other than advertising, which is there, which where we make most of our economics, because the principal three sources economics are subscriptions, job listings and advertising. Now, the advertising is there, but we try to make a discreet. I frequently get the idea and realize it was advertising. Well, yeah, there is. But also job listings and then subscriptions, which allow any individual to reach out directly to someone else in the system through a reputation based service. The only time that you really encounter that is either if someone's trying to get in touch with you or you're trying to get in touch with someone and then you want to go direct to them and we say, well, now you need to be a subscriber. There was a question here. So being a guest needs to be going to the kids in Mexico. Excellent. You may be the exception that proves the rule. Yeah, hopefully. You followed a similar path because you were at Stanford, then you went into academia. I can't think of anything that's less risk than academia. And more or less. And then you suddenly stepped out of that. What motivated you to step out of that? Did you have an idea with what you were planning? What was that I understand? You didn't like the academia, did you just simply decide to get up and meet? Or was there something in the back? I mean, a bit of your personal experience in that sense, because I'm finding myself to know. So the question to repeat it, as I remember this time, I can learn new tricks. Is I was leading an academic path, which has a certain amount of, well, at least it's a beaten path, whether or not it's risk-free or not, is a different question. And what was it that motivated me to leave that path of? And it was actually, I mean, I went to Stanford, you know, all these competition to get in and then, you know, competed for the Marshall scholarship and got that and went to Oxford and, you know, was going to go back to get a PhD, which another competition, all kind of well understood path. And part of, it basically was actually really the following insight for me was two things. I wanted to achieve things that had a certain scale. That's what motivates me. It's actually not many entrepreneurs or many people are invested, you know, like, I want a big pile of money, right? For me, money is instrumental. Big pile of money is useful. You can do stuff with it, but I don't measure value in that way. Some people are famed. Like, well, I want my picture in the front page of the New York Times. And, you know, I'll do that for instrumental, but I don't care about that either. But when I value what I'm trying to achieve in terms of what I think of the meaning of my life, it's how do I achieve something of scale that that help make society interesting and better. And I said, okay, well, how do you do that? How do you achieve something of scale? Because if you actually go through all the normal hoops, the ability where you do that is way down that path. It's like, there's lots and lots and lots of hoops. That was a whole point about like, okay, I can eventually write popular books as an academic, but I have to have gotten 10 year already, right, as a professor before I can do that. And that's 15 years of writing books for 50 people. And I was like, I don't want to do that. That's a lot of hoops to get to that point. And I said, well, what I realized was, if you follow beaten paths, it's almost always by nature much longer. There's a lot of people doing it. There's a lot of competition and so forth. And so you have to be willing to take risk. You have to leave that path. You have to do something that most other people don't do because they think that looks risky. This is the accurate contrarian. They go, ooh, if you jump off that cliff, you land on the end and you kill yourself. So no one jumps off that cliff. But if you're right and you got the right equipment, and you make it happen, then you can achieve something of scale. And I realized that was what I thought was a fundamental principle in the world. And so my, then what my effort was to leave that path as fast as I could to go do something, to try something. And you have to be careful about it. And I was fortunate that my dad's kind of, you know, upper middle class. So I could spend out all my money and be absolutely broke and move back home. Now he would say, get a job and you're going to work your way out of a living in the side room in my apartment. But that was, you know, I knew that was an asset that I could use to take that risk. But it's like generally speaking, if you can take a smart controlled risk, you'd accomplish a lot more than if you avoid risk. And that was the idea. And then I started trying to figure out how to do the things I cared about. So other questions? One of my frustrations with all these networking sites is that there's no meta network inside where I can upload one single profile and just publish it to all the other social networking sites and see what you can comment that content comes up. I was wondering, is LinkedIn going to ever take that route or attempt to because you already plug into Firefox? So someone's got some skills like that there. We do have plug in the Firefox. It would be embarrassing for me being on the board of Mozilla, not having plug in the Firefox. So the question, yes, thank you, was basically will LinkedIn become an Uber network where it's a central hub for publishing to lots of networks or something like that. And the answer is a little bit yes and a little bit no. The answer that's a little bit yes is one of the strategic goals LinkedIn is to be your professional profile on the web. So we will help you publish that to wherever you want. So we already help you publish to Google. So we have a little, we have a two person group that actually works on SEO and all public profiles. So when someone types in your name, we try to get it so that you're if you published your LinkedIn profile web, it's in the first page of results. So publishing your profile, something we will help with. Publishing to other networks. We're not adverse to publishing the profiles on the networks and everything else, but we're also trying to make sure that we have that central where the publishing point with you. So we'd only do that if we thought there was a lot of demand for publishing to this network. Like if suddenly all professionals said, I want my LinkedIn page to be on my space page. Then fine, we do that now. It's a little weird universe. I don't know if it exists. But, but that it's like one of the rules and the net, which I really like. It's one of the things that's a area of business I like being in is always treat your customer first. So if your customer said, I really want that, then you do it. Now, it's actually a kind of a high and Silicon Valley geek perspective to think about multiple, like one profile across multiple networks. It's, by the way, I've seen eight or nine business ideas and that and not invested in any of them because they're actually really hard to get off the ground. The real central thing is having one thing that's really core that gets a lot of people into it because they find this valuable. The multiple things, most your average, like I already have a tough sell to your average person in the world saying you should have a profile on the web. Think of you walk up to somebody in the street in San Jose. Well, how are you going to manage all your identities and social networks? Wouldn't you like a program for that? They would look at you like you were crazy. So was another question? You mentioned that going into the market as a without competition is your preference. And then if you look at friend's services, my space clearly, my space has dominated and taken over and came after them. And so as a professional defended your term, I'm interested in seeing what you thought about the friend's services, my space, what happened there, what friends are did wrong, what my space did right. Let's see. So I am an investor in a friend's here. Oh, yes. The question is, friends here was a first mover. My space came soon after, but after the great granddaddy and the categories, my space rather than friendship. What happened usually first mover has enough advantage that if you can close the door behind you, you have a successful thing. Good interpretation. Basically, it was friends who's game will lose. Friends who are through a variety of internal conflicts and internal policy can't coherently agree on a strategy or solve its problems, which had serious scaling problems. One of the principles on the web is there's a really direct measurement between the time of speed that your pay loads and your customer happiness and your customer willingness to go somewhere else. So I actually like, for example, I'll give you an example that Marissa Meyer talked about at Google, they tested doing 30 answers rather than 10 and they went, wow, people hate this. They don't click on links and it was work. Let's go back to 10. And then what they did is they tested 10 and 30 with the same time of page load and they liked them both. It was time page load. Friends were getting up to, when it was peak times, when it wasn't down, up to page times of minutes. And it says how strong that first mover advantage was that it kept growing and people kept using it despite the fact that when you came in during a peak time, load page, go get cup coffee, come back. And so one of the sad things is if friends who had been able to both deal with its technical problems and then I started dressing markets, there wouldn't have been room, I don't think, in my view, for my space, even Facebook, which I'm also invested in and so forth, because they would have been able to take that first mover advantage and do it. And part of that, it's a lesson in startups. I think one of the reasons I wasn't in privy to the internal, politic in discussions, but I think the problem is everyone had a different idea and they were trying to do it all at once. And one of the things you do in startup is you're always taking risks, you do this now, then that. And then that, I think you just do them. And sometimes you guess wrong and you're dead. And that happens. Like any successful entrepreneur stays at the helm, you made the transition from person with the idea, envisionary, to channel manager. Can you tell me about a couple of interesting or surprising, not obvious things you've learned in becoming a better general manager and what strategy you've best to learn? Let me see if I have two questions. Let me see which one you're asking. Could be both. One is transitioning the helm of why I hired a CEO and that sort of thing. That was Tuesday. So it's relatively recent. Or how did I learn to be a general manager or did I misunderstand your question? So one of the benefits you have of capital boom. So like in the, you know, a little bit now and certainly back in the late 90s is, oh, sorry, I'll read that question. How did that get on the path being a general manager? Well, actually there's two stages that are valuable. So one of the things I realized about how internal company politics work, big companies, is that people who want to stay in those companies and so forth tend to just kind of gravitate towards successful projects and run away from unsuccessful projects. Because part of their career successes, oh, I was part of the Macintosh, right? And that was really successful. Look, you don't want to be part of the Newton. Newton was, was graveyard. So you can go, oh, I'm going to stop working on the Newton. I'm going to see if I can get transferred to the Macintosh division. So if you're in a big company and all you care about, like what I, all I cared about was getting general experience with P&L management, managing groups, hiring people, layoffs, organizing software development from our perspective. I just looked for a project that I thought was interesting that was failing. So I wouldn't have competition for getting a job. And that's why I went to Fujitsu. Because it was virtual world thing back in 1996. And virtual worlds were kind of crazy idea. We'll see what Second Life does. Most interesting thing currently, but maybe it will maybe won't. Who knows. Looks promising. The second piece is, as then when I stepped out of Fujitsu into, into starting social lab, when you have a good idea, you know, people are willing to take some risk on you. For example, I had never, I mean, this is one of the classic dilemmas is, you have to know the V0 to V1 game. How do you do that? Well, you can either find something good and join it early or you can, you can persuade someone to let you do it for the first time. During a boom time, it's much easier to persuade someone to let you do that for the first time. Right? Because they're eager enough to find interesting investments. They'll take that risk. Right? So that's the second way of doing it. So one's in a kind of entrepreneur environment, one's in a becoming environment. I don't know if there's others or maybe others too. Get an MBA and go to McKinsey. Other questions? Well, somewhat. So the question is, most people don't understand viral distribution elaborate, please. There are a bunch of very deep skills and techniques for doing virality right. I keep a list of the people who I know who know that. And the list is currently 12 people. I know I'm a list. But. And you know, there's a bunch of stuff that can be done well. But it's a lot of work and there's a lot of different things. I mean, I started really paying attention to this when I was realize, because I saw six degrees launch. And I thought, oh, that's clever. Right? And then when we were working out stuff at PayPal, another guy, Luke Nozick, came up with this idea of, well, hell, why don't we spread viral by rewarding people for, for like when I got you to sign up, you got 10 bucks and I got 10 bucks. Almost clever. Right. Showed the value proposition as well. So there's a whole bunch of. It's not putting up a little email your friends link. It's a lot more than that. So those. I just hear what do you think are the threats now that I have so much problems. So the question is what are the threats linked in now that has problems. I think our principal threat is. It's very funny. We had a couple of internal meetings on this. My team would prefer we had competition right here because it's someone to race against because it gives you a sense of urgency. It's like beat them. One faster than that. Right? And it's actually really easy to motivate Matt Circumstance. It's a little disorienting to be looking around in the English world and go, okay, well, what we do, we do best. We're biggest by orders of magnitude. Right. So I think primarily we got this challenge of continuing to develop and elucidate the service in a good way and make sure that people understand how to use it and start using and adopting it. But as far as we can tell right now, there's no immediate competitor threat. Not in English in a way. There's a site that wants to compete with us that's primarily German, called Open B.C. Zing. And they went public on the Frankfurt Exchange declaring competition with us. But I don't think they got the model that we're trying to do down. So I'll actually prefer you can ask me after all. I'm going to prefer new questions. Yeah. Good. No, no. Do you ask one already? Yeah. Okay. So what do you think is the difference in skills required from the 20 being a good entrepreneur and then being a good professional manager once the company's already made it? So the question is what are the skills required for being in a trip on our versus a professional general manager? And actually, there's a it's a really good question because it's part of what I think is the difference in a startup and a kind of a going concern company. People frequently say startup and big company. But in this case, there were big companies come startups. So the answer is why did Steve Jobs have to take back over Apple and totally transformative? It's because Apple was already a dead company. It was already dying. Right. And it needed a radical innovation. So he came in and did what a startup person does or entrepreneur person does, even though it was a company with thousands of employees. What I start up an entrepreneur skill set is taking wild but focused risks. You put it all on number eight and you're all the dice. Right. And you see if you're working on and making those bets well because the way you get to discontinuous value is you take that focused risk and if it pays off, you get something very valuable if you're intelligent and how you do it. Being a general manager of an asset and going concern, you are actually paid to not risk the asset. You want growth. But like people will fire you and sue you if you blow up this thing that's already, you know, throws off money year by year because it's going concern. So here is when you're fundamentally dead, right. And you're trying to get to something interesting and making an asset. Once you make an asset, it's managed it to this is where, for example, MBAs turned to be useful. Right. Because the question is, be very thoughtful and analytic in your decision making to make sure that you minimize risk and maximize growth within a decision matrix is supposed to take one big discontinuous risk. That this is actually one of the reasons why a lot of the structural training in MBAs is wrong for entrepreneurship because the structural training is a lot of analysis, a lot of thinking, a lot of like put the pieces together. One of the things I learned about entrepreneurship is, this is a PayPal was when I'm confronted with any decision, I make the decision right away and then I think about whether or not I make it. Right. So you say, well, we're going to take path A or path B, I go, hmm, A. Now, okay. I'm still comfortable with that. Or do I make the decision, get couple pieces of specific information and then remake the decision. Because you like make the decision now, go, go, go. You don't do that when you're being a professional manager in asset. At least you shouldn't. Okay. I know that we're about to do an answer to this question. What's your vision and what's your experience so far? Okay. So the question about LinkedIn answers, vision, experience so far, what's going on. So I'm hoping the LinkedIn answers will be the first very successful answer product on the web. Not to say Yahoo answers is unsuccessful. But it's messy and it's more useful for like, you know, what is Britney Spears favorite color? You know, that kind of stuff. Google answers as people may or may not know was shut down because it couldn't get enough volume was using an economic model. LinkedIn answers the idea was and the kind of the apps that we will be generating to try to help each person with their, with their, the value of having LinkedIn network is, what are the kinds of things that professionals actually do in order to be successful? Professionals where they use their network and it's on a daily or weekly or frequent basis and one of them you use, then you have a network. As you go and ask them for perspective and advice on things. So for example, one of the things is we're going to be opening a European headquarters. The normal way that I would start with this is I'd start calling people I know who may be an open to European headquarters before I know someone said, do you know anyone can tell what the issues are. You know, they might say stay away from Paris. They have terrible labor laws, which is true. Hopefully that won't offend my French friends. Because basically if you fire someone you have to give me your severance. Troponural things very bad. And what I did is I actually posed this question on LinkedIn answers and I got, can't remember the exact number of answers. I think there's 20 answers of which about 18 of them were good answers. It covered the gamut of all the variables that I needed to look at. Things like taxation policy, direct flights, available tech, labor market, contrast in European centrality and a whole bunch of other things. So I spent two minutes writing a question. I got a wide contribution from a large number of people on the kind of answer that would be very helpful. And even though that doesn't fully answer the question, it now makes my next step of, okay, now I'm going to go choose one much faster, much quicker, much more effective. And that's the philosophy of what we're trying to do with it, which is to give each person the benefit of having their network, you know, the people who are responsive to them. Because part of the reason why people answered the questions is that, oh, you're a friend of friends. Sure, I'll help you with this. Here's some things to think about. That's the basic idea of LinkedIn answers.
